            "title": "A Global Model for Forecasting Political Instability",
            "abstract": "Examining onsets of political instability in countries worldwide from 1955 to 2003, we develop a model that distinguishes countries that experienced instability from those that remained stable with a two-year lead time and over 80% accuracy. Intriguingly, the model uses few variables and a simple specification. The model is accurate in forecasting the onsets of both violent civil wars and nonviolent democratic reversals, suggesting common factors in both types of change. Whereas regime type is typically measured using linear or binary indicators of democracy/autocracy derived from the 21-point Polity scale, the model uses a nonlinear five-category measure of regime type based on the Polity components. This new measure of regime type emerges as the most powerful predictor of instability onsets, leading us to conclude that political institutions, properly specified, and not economic conditions, demography, or geography, are the most important predictors of the onset of political instability.",

            "abstract": "Large-n studies of conflict have produced a large number of statistically significant results but little accurate guidance in terms of anticipating the onset of conflict. The authors argue that too much attention has been paid to finding statistically significant relationships, while too little attention has been paid to finding variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars. The result can be a distorted view of what matters most to the onset of conflict. Although these models may not be intended to be predictive models, prescriptions based on these models are generally based on statistical significance, and the predictive attributes of the underlying models are generally ignored. These predictions should not be ignored, but rather need to be heuristically evaluated because they may shed light on the veracity of the models. In this study, the authors conduct a side-by-side comparison of the statistical significance and predictive power of the different variables used in two of the most influential models of civil war. The results provide a clear demonstration of how potentially misleading the traditional focus on statistical significance can be. Until out-of-sample heuristics \u2014 especially including predictions \u2014 are part of the normal evaluative tools in conflict research, we are unlikely to make sufficient theoretical progress beyond broad statements that point to GDP per capita and population as the major causal factors accounting for civil war onset.",

            "abstract": "This article describes the results of a broad reanalysis of factors shaping the prospects of countries making a transition to or from democracy using a new measure of regime type. While some of the results are consistent with prior quantitative and comparative research, others are not. For example, in line with other studies, the article finds that autocracies are more likely to make a transition to democracy when they offer broader protections for civil liberties, experience a change in political leadership, or suffer an economic downturn. At the same time, the analysis does not support the claim that transitions in neighbouring countries directly improve prospects for a transition to democracy, or that economic decline and presidential systems heighten the risk of democratic breakdown. Perhaps most intriguing, our model of transitions to democracy also identifies a new twist on old stories linking economic development to democratization. For countries under authoritarian rule that have attempted democracy before, the research here indicates that development does improve prospects for another attempt, as modernization theory suggests. For countries with no democratic experience, however, affluence conveys no direct democratizing benefit and appears, if anything, to help sustain authoritarian rule.",

The authors extend arguments about the precursors to nonviolent protest, violent rebellion, and civil war. These arguments motivate a series of hypotheses that are tested against data from the Minorities at Risk project. The results of the analysis suggest, first, that the factors that predict antistate activity at one level of violence do not always hold at other levels; second, the response by the state has a large impact on the subsequent behavior of the rebels; and third, the popular notion of diamonds fueling civil unrest is generally not supported. The authors draw inferences from their results to future theoretical and policy development.",

Results show that Africa has had a similar incidence of civil conflict to other developing regions, and, with minor exceptions, its conflicts are consistent with the global pattern of behavior. However, the structure of risk differs considerably from other regions. Africa's economic characteristics have made it more vulnerable to conflict, but this has been offset by social characteristics that make its societies atypically safe. The contrasting trends of conflict are analyzed: rising in Africa and declining in other regions. Results show that these trends are predicted by the model. Africa's rising trend of conflict is due to its atypically poor economic performance.",

            "abstract": "We offer the first independent scholarly evaluation of the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences of the State Failure Task Force and their efforts to forecast when states will fail. State failure refers to the collapse of the authority of the central government to impose order, as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides, politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions. This task force, set up at the behest of Vice President Gore in 1994, has been led by a group of distinguished academics working as consultants to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. State Failure Task Force reports and publications have received attention in the media, in academia, and from public policy decision-makers. In this article, we identify several methodological errors in the task force work that cause their reported forecast probabilities of conflict to be too large, their causal inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and their claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated. However, we also find that the task force has amassed the best and most carefully collected data on state failure in existence, and the required corrections which we provide, although very large in effect, are easy to implement. We also reanalyze their data with better statistical procedures and demonstrate how to improve forecasting performance to levels significantly greater than even corrected versions of their models. Although still a highly uncertain endeavor, we are as a consequence able to offer the first accurate forecasts of state failure, along with procedures and results that may be of practical use in informing foreign policy decision making. We also describe a number of strong empirical regularities that may help in ascertaining the causes of state failure.",

            "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, Africa's civil wars are not due to its ethnic and religious diversity. Using recently developed models of the overall prevalence of civil wars in 161 countries between 1960-1999, we draw lessons with special reference to Africa, showing that the relatively higher prevalence of war in Africa is not due to the ethno-linguistic fragmentation of its countries, but rather to high levels of poverty, failed political institutions, and economic dependence on natural resources. We argue that the best and fastest strategy to reduce the prevalence of civil war in Africa and prevent future civil wars is to institute democratic reforms that effectively manage the challenges facing Africa's diverse societies. To promote inter-group cooperation in Africa, specially tailored political governance and economic management institutions are needed and we advance some hypotheses on the nature of such institutions. We suggest that Africa's ethnic diversity in fact helps --it does not impede-- the emergence of stable development as it necessitates inter-group bargaining processes. These processes can be peaceful if ethnic groups feel adequately represented by their national political institutions and if the economy provides opportunity for productive activity.",

            "abstract": "We address a well-known but infrequently discussed problem in the quantitative study of international conflict: Despite immense data collections, prestigious journals, and sophisticated analyses, empirical findings in the literature on international conflict are often unsatisfying. Many statistical results change from article to article and specification to specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistent. In this article we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem: The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large, stable, and replicable wherever the ex ante probability of conflict is large. This simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array of observable implications, all consistent with the literature. We directly test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that includes its critical features. Our approach, a version of a \u201cneural network\u201d model, uncovers some interesting structural features of international conflict and, as one evaluative measure, forecasts substantially better than any previous effort. Moreover, this improvement comes at little cost, and it is easy to evaluate whether the model is a statistical improvement over the simpler models commonly used.",

            "abstract": "We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros (\u201cnonevents\u201d). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.",

            "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered frequent outbreaks of armed conflict since the end of the Cold War. Although several efforts have been made to understand the underlying causes of armed conflict and establish an early warning mechanism, there is still a lack of a comprehensive assessment approach to model the incidence risk of armed conflict well. Based on a large database of armed conflict events and related spatial datasets covering the period 2000\u20132019, this study uses a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach to model the spatiotemporal distribution of armed conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of accuracy indicates that the simulated models obtain high performance with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) mean value of 0.937 and an area under the precision recall curves (PR-AUC) mean value of 0.891. The result of the relative contribution indicates that the background context factors (i.e., social welfare and the political system) are the main driving factors of armed conflict risk, with a mean relative contribution of 92.599%. By comparison, the climate change-related variables have relatively little effect on armed conflict risk, accounting for only 7.401% of the total. These results provide novel insight into modelling the incidence risk of armed conflict, which may help implement interventions to prevent and minimize the harm of armed conflict.",

            "abstract": "Protest is a low-intensity form of political conflict that can precipitate intrastate armed conflict. Data on protests should therefore be informative in systems that provide early warnings of armed conflict. However, since most protests do not escalate to armed conflict, we first need theory to inform our prediction models. We identify three theoretical explanations relating to protest-repression dynamics, political institutions and economic development as the basis for our models. Based on theory, we operationalize nine models and leverage the political Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) to generate subnational forecasts for intrastate armed conflict in Africa. Results show that protest data substantially improves conflict incidence and onset predictions compared to baseline models that account for conflict history. Moreover, the results underline the centrality of theory for conflict forecasting: our theoretically informed protest models outperform naive models that treat all protests equally.",

We propose a graph transformation approach for efficient classification in chaotic human systems that is based on game theoretic, network theoretic, and chaos theoretic principles. Graph structural properties are compiled into time-series that are then transposed into the frequency domain to offer a dynamic view of the system for classification. We propose a set of benchmark data sets and show through experiments that the approach is efficient and appropriate for many dynamic networks in which agents both compete and cooperate, such as social media networks, stock markets, political campaigns, legislation, and geopolitical events.",

            "abstract": "\n Contemporary governments are awash in quantification, as numbers and algorithms play an ever-greater role in public decision-making processes. In the field of defense and diplomacy, the development of armed conflict databases holds out the promise of improved predictive capacities and early warning systems. While this dynamic can be witnessed across a range of European countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, it appears to be much less present in France. Diplomats and militaries make only marginal use of the available databases, judged both inadequate in their own right and ill-adapted to strategic analysis. This article proposes two explanatory variables to explain this specific appreciation: not only is a relatively limited training in quantitative methods offered to French diplomats and militaries, which leads to a specific use of numbers, but there is also a broader picture link to the will of protecting \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d in the international realm.",

            "abstract": "Prior research suggests that the timing and location of social unrest may be influenced by similar unrest activities in another nearby region, potentially causing a spread of unrest activities across space and time. In this paper, we model the spread of social unrest across time and space using a novel approach, grounded in agent-based modeling (ABM). In it, regions (geographic polygons) are represented as agents that transition from one state to another based on changes in their environment. Our approach involves (1) creating a vector for each region/agent based on socio-demographic, infrastructural, economic, geographic, and environmental (SIEGE) factors, (2) formulating a neighborhood distance function to identify an agent's neighbors based on geospatial distance and SIEGE proximity, (3) designing transition probability equations based on two distinct compartmental models\u2014i.e., the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models, and (4) building a ground truth for evaluating the simulations. We use ABM to determine the individualized probabilities of each region/agent to transition from one state to another. The models are tested using the districts of three states in India as agents at a monthly scale for 2016-2019. For ground truth of unrest events, we use the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) dataset. Our findings include that (1) the transition probability equations are viable, (2) the agent-based modeling of the spread of social unrest is feasible while treating regions as agents (Brier's score < 0.25 for two out of three regions), and (3) the SIS model performs comparatively better than the SIR model.",

            "abstract": "Although there are plenty of quantitative cross-national analyses on the influence of population age structure on revolutionary risks, there are currently not enough studies that examine its impact on the risks of armed and unarmed revolutions taken separately. Assuming that the dependence of potential political destabilization on the median age will differ for armed and unarmed revolutions, we propose the following hypothesis. High median age and the level of a country\u2019s economic development will negatively correlate with armed revolutions. A moderately young median age will have positive influence on the risks of non-violent rebellions, while the overall dependence of unarmed revolutions on median age will be slightly positive and curvilinear. Relying on materials from NAVCO 1.3 and the UN Population Division databases and by means of utilizing cross-tabulations, correlations and logistic regression, we analyze about 250 revolutionary episodes between 1950 and 2019. All of our hypotheses turn out to be supported. The higher the median age of the population \u2014 the less likely the occurrence will be of armed revolutionary instability. On the other hand, as the population ages, the risks of unarmed revolutionary actions first grow, but then decline.",

This thorny forecasting problem may in part be due to the literature\u2019s heavy focus on parametric forecasting methods and relatively rare testing and comparison of a wide range of forecasting algorithms. This paper addresses these gaps in the literature by developing the first unified forecasting model of both major armed and unarmed conflicts at the country-year level based on extensive training, cross-validation, and comparison of eight machine learning algorithms and five forecasting ensembles. We draw on two types of data: slow-moving structural factors such as geography and levels of economic development and short-term political dynamics captured by events data trends, to inform our forecasting models. This approach significantly improves predictive power for both armed and unarmed conflict in comparison to commonly used methods in the literature and suggests that there is significant room for improving forecasts of major political conflicts. However, our algorithms still forecast armed conflict significantly better than unarmed conflict, suggesting the need for continued theory development to inform future forecasting efforts in this area. El poder predecir los grandes conflictos pol\u00edticos es un tema que interesa desde hace tiempo dentro del campo de la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos. Sin embargo, hasta ahora, la literatura especializada se ha centrado casi exclusivamente en los conflictos armados, como, por ejemplo, las guerras civiles. Los intentos de predecir conflictos, principalmente no armados, a\u00fan no han podido identificar un modelo capaz de pronosticar estos levantamientos con un alto grado de precisi\u00f3n. Este azaroso problema para realizar predicciones puede deberse, en parte, a que la literatura se centra mucho en los m\u00e9todos predictivos param\u00e9tricos y a que las pruebas y comparaciones de una amplia gama de algoritmos de predicci\u00f3n son relativamente escasas. Este art\u00edculo aborda estas lagunas en la literatura desarrollando el primer modelo unificado de predicci\u00f3n, tanto de los grandes conflictos armados como de los no armados a nivel de pa\u00eds-a\u00f1o, basado en formaci\u00f3n intensiva, validaci\u00f3n cruzada y en la comparaci\u00f3n de ocho algoritmos de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico y cinco conjuntos predictivos. Recurrimos a dos tipos de datos: factores estructurales de evoluci\u00f3n lenta, como la geograf\u00eda y los niveles de desarrollo econ\u00f3mico, as\u00ed como la din\u00e1mica pol\u00edtica a corto plazo plasmada en las tendencias registradas en los datos de los acontecimientos, para fundamentar nuestros modelos de predicci\u00f3n. Este enfoque mejora significativamente el poder de predicci\u00f3n, tanto para los conflictos armados como para los no armados, en comparaci\u00f3n con los m\u00e9todos que se usan habitualmente en la literatura y sugiere que hay un margen significativo para mejorar las predicciones de los grandes conflictos pol\u00edticos. Sin embargo, nuestros algoritmos siguen prediciendo mucho mejor los conflictos armados que los no armados, lo que sugiere la necesidad de seguir desarrollando la teor\u00eda para fundamentar los futuros esfuerzos de predicci\u00f3n en este \u00e1mbito. L\u2019anticipation de conflits politiques majeurs est un objet de recherche d\u00e9j\u00e0 ancien. Toutefois, \u00e0 ce jour, la litt\u00e9rature sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e existante est presque exclusivement focalis\u00e9e sur les conflits arm\u00e9s, tels que les guerres civiles. Les efforts de pr\u00e9diction portant sur des conflits principalement non arm\u00e9s requi\u00e8rent donc l\u2019identification d\u2019un mod\u00e8le capable de pr\u00e9voir les soul\u00e8vements, et ce avec un haut degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cision. Cet \u00e9pineux probl\u00e8me de pr\u00e9vision est probablement partiellement d\u00fb \u00e0 une litt\u00e9rature fortement ax\u00e9e sur des m\u00e9thodes de pr\u00e9vision de type param\u00e9trique, laissant peu de place au test et \u00e0 la comparaison d\u2019un vaste \u00e9ventail d\u2019algorithmes pr\u00e9dictifs. Cet article a vocation \u00e0 combler cette lacune en d\u00e9veloppant le premier mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9dictif unifi\u00e9 pour des conflits majeurs arm\u00e9s comme non arm\u00e9s, par pays et par ann\u00e9e. Ce type de mod\u00e8le s\u2019appuie sur un entra\u00eenement approfondi, une validation crois\u00e9e et une comparaison portant sur huit algorithmes d\u2019apprentissage automatique et cinq ensembles pr\u00e9dictifs. Pour informer nos mod\u00e8les, nous nous appuyons sur deux types de donn\u00e9es : des facteurs structurels \u00e0 \u00e9volution lente, tels que la g\u00e9ographie ou le niveau de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, d\u2019une part, et sur des dynamiques politiques \u00e0 court terme, illustr\u00e9es par des donn\u00e9es sur les tendances \u00e9v\u00e9nementielles, d\u2019autre part. Cette approche permet d\u2019am\u00e9liorer de mani\u00e8re significative les capacit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9diction pour les conflits arm\u00e9s comme non arm\u00e9s, par rapport aux m\u00e9thodes habituellement utilis\u00e9es dans la litt\u00e9rature, et sugg\u00e8re que la pr\u00e9vision des conflits politiques majeurs peut encore \u00eatre consid\u00e9rablement optimis\u00e9e. Toutefois, nos algorithmes restent nettement plus performants pour la pr\u00e9vision des conflits arm\u00e9s que pour les conflits non arm\u00e9s ; un constat refl\u00e9tant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de poursuivre ce travail th\u00e9orique, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 mieux informer les futurs efforts de pr\u00e9vision dans ce domaine.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Quantitative methods have been used to: (1) better predict civil conflict onset; and (2) understand causal mechanisms to inform policy intervention and theory. However, an exploration of individual conflict onset cases illustrates great variation in the characteristics describing the outbreak of civil war, suggesting that there is not one single set of factors that lead to intrastate war. In this article, we use descriptive statistics to explore persistent clusters in the drivers of civil war onset, finding evidence that some arrangements of structural drivers cluster robustly across multiple model specifications (such as young, poorly developed states with anocratic regimes). Additionally, we find that approximately one-fifth of onset cases cannot be neatly clustered across models, suggesting that these cases are difficult to predict and multiple methods for understanding civil conflict onset (and state failure more generally) may be necessary.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Recent research on the forecasting of violence has mostly focused on predicting the presence or absence of conflict in a given location, while much less attention has been paid to predicting changes in violence. We organized a prediction competition to forecast changes in state-based violence both for the true future and for a test partition. We received contributions from 15 international teams. The models leverage new insight on the targeted problem, insisting on methodological advances, new data and features, and innovative frameworks which contribute to the research frontiers from various perspectives. This article introduces the competition, presents the main innovations fostered by the teams and discusses ways to further expand and improve upon this wisdom of the crowd. We show that an optimal modeling approach builds on a good number of the presented contributions and new evaluation metrics are needed to capture substantial models\u2019 improvements and reward unique insights. La investigaci\u00f3n reciente sobre la previsi\u00f3n de la violencia se ha centrado principalmente en predecir la presencia o ausencia de conflictos en un determinado lugar, mientras que se ha prestado mucha menos atenci\u00f3n a predecir los cambios en la violencia. Organizamos una competencia de predicci\u00f3n para predecir los cambios en la violencia estatal tanto para el futuro cierto como para una divisi\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis. Recibimos aportes de quince equipos internacionales. Los modelos aprovechan las nuevas ideas sobre el problema espec\u00edfico insistiendo en los avances metodol\u00f3gicos, los nuevos datos y caracter\u00edsticas, as\u00ed como en los marcos innovadores que contribuyen a las fronteras de la investigaci\u00f3n desde diversas perspectivas. Este art\u00edculo presenta la competencia y las principales innovaciones que los equipos fomentan, y analiza maneras de expandirse y mejorar a\u00fan m\u00e1s a partir de esta sabidur\u00eda del p\u00fablico. Mostramos que un enfoque de modelaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptimo se crea a partir de un buen n\u00famero de aportes presentados y que se necesitan nuevas m\u00e9tricas de evaluaci\u00f3n para capturar las mejoras considerables de los modelos y para premiar las ideas \u00fanicas. Les recherches r\u00e9centes sur la pr\u00e9vision de la violence se sont principalement concentr\u00e9es sur la pr\u00e9diction de la pr\u00e9sence ou de l\u2019absence de conflit dans un lieu donn\u00e9, alors que beaucoup moins d\u2019attention a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9diction des \u00e9volutions de la violence.

            "title": "Forecasting conflict in Africa with automated machine learning systems",
            "abstract": "Abstract The ViEWS problem is to forecast changes in the level of state-based violence for each of the next six months at the PRIO-GRID and country level. For this competition and toward the goal of improving sub-national and country level forecasts, we experiment with combinations of automated machine learning (autoML) systems and limited datasets that emphasize the endogenous nature of conflict. Two core findings emerge: autoML improves predictive performance and the Dynamics model performs best. The data used for the Dynamics model is limited to measures of state-based violence built from the event-level violence data plus those describing the spatial and temporal structure of the data. The intent is to capture spatial and temporal conflict dynamics while not overfitting to exogenous factors, which is especially problematic with flexible autoML algorithms and the types of highly disaggregate data used here. At the PGM level, this model won the ViEWS competition for \u201cpredictive accuracy\u201d and split the win for \u201coriginality.\u201d Beyond the ViEWS competition, we expect conflict forecasting models that couple advanced autoML systems with variables that reflect a diverse set of conflict dynamics to have high predictive performance, especially at sub-national and sub-annual aggregations. El problema del ViEWS es que predice los cambios en el nivel de violencia estatal de cada uno de los pr\u00f3ximos seis meses a nivel de PRIO-GRID y de pa\u00eds. En el marco de esta competencia y con el objetivo de mejorar las predicciones a nivel regional y nacional, probamos combinaciones de sistemas de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico (autoML) y conjuntos de datos limitados que ponen de relieve la naturaleza end\u00f3gena de los conflictos. Hay dos resultados principales: el autoML mejora el rendimiento predictivo y el modelo Dynamics es el que mejor funciona. Los datos utilizados para el modelo Dynamics se limitan a las medidas de la violencia a nivel estatal establecidas a partir de los datos de la violencia sobre eventos m\u00e1s los que describen la estructura espacial y temporal de los datos. La intenci\u00f3n es captar la din\u00e1mica espacial y temporal de los conflictos sin caer en el exceso de ajuste de los factores ex\u00f3genos, lo que supone un problema, sobre todo con los algoritmos autoML flexibles y los tipos de datos altamente desagregados que se utilizan aqu\u00ed. A nivel de PGM, este modelo gan\u00f3 la competencia del ViEWS tanto por su \u201cprecisi\u00f3n predictiva\u201d como por su \u201coriginalidad\u201d. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la competencia del ViEWS, esperamos que los modelos de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos que combinan sistemas avanzados de autoML con variables que reflejan un conjunto diverso de din\u00e1micas de conflicto tengan un alto resultado predictivo, sobre todo en agregados regionales y semestrales. La probl\u00e9matique du ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) est de pr\u00e9voir les \u00e9volutions du niveau de violence \u00e9tatique pour chacun des six prochains mois au niveau de la grille PRIO et au niveau national. Pour ce concours et dans l\u2019objectif d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les pr\u00e9visions au niveau infranational et au niveau national, nous avons exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 des combinaisons de syst\u00e8mes de machine learning automatis\u00e9s (autoML) et de jeux de donn\u00e9es limit\u00e9s mettant l\u2019accent sur la nature endog\u00e8ne des conflits. Deux r\u00e9sultats fondamentaux sont apparus : l\u2019autoML am\u00e9liore les performances pr\u00e9dictives et le mod\u00e8le Dynamiques est le plus efficace. Les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es pour le mod\u00e8le Dynamiques sont limit\u00e9es aux mesures de la violence \u00e9tatique \u00e9tablies \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es sur la violence au niveau des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ainsi que de celles qui d\u00e9crivent la structure spatiale et temporelle des donn\u00e9es. L\u2019objectif est de capturer les dynamiques spatiales et temporelles des conflits tout en \u00e9vitant un ajustement excessif aux facteurs exog\u00e8nes, ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement probl\u00e9matique avec les algorithmes d\u2019autoML flexibles et les types de donn\u00e9es tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9g\u00e9es qui sont utilis\u00e9s ici. Au niveau PGM, ce mod\u00e8le a remport\u00e9 le concours ViEWS \u00e0 la fois dans les cat\u00e9gories \u00ab Pr\u00e9cision pr\u00e9dictive \u00bb et \u00ab Originalit\u00e9 \u00bb. Au-del\u00e0 du concours ViEWS, nous nous attendons \u00e0 ce que les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9vision des conflits qui allient des syst\u00e8mes avanc\u00e9s d\u2019autoML \u00e0 des variables refl\u00e9tant un ensemble diversifi\u00e9 de dynamiques de conflits aient de hautes performances pr\u00e9dictives, en particulier aux niveaux d\u2019agr\u00e9gation infranationaux et infra-annuels.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Can history predict the escalation of future violence? This research note evaluates the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) Prediction Competition. Existing research on civil conflict shows violence is a persistent and recurring process, often shaping the direction of future conflicts. Building on this insight, I build a RNN model to examine how well historical patterns in conflict predict long-term escalation trends. A RNN is a simple, but powerful machine learning tool for time series forecasting due to its capacity to learn long sequences of information. I show that an RNN model can produce relatively accurate forecasts due to systematic patterns in conflict processes, consistent with existing research on \u201cconflict traps.\u201d The results provide important lessons for conflict forecasting and ground opportunities for using RNN models in future political science research. \u00bfLa historia puede predecir el aumento de la violencia en el futuro? Esta nota de investigaci\u00f3n eval\u00faa el uso de una red neuronal recurrente (Recurrent Neural Network, RNN) para la competencia de predicciones del Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS). Las investigaciones existentes sobre los conflictos civiles demuestran que la violencia es un proceso persistente y recurrente que, a menudo, da forma a la direcci\u00f3n de futuros conflictos. Con base en esta percepci\u00f3n, elaboro un modelo de RNN para examinar la eficacia de los patrones hist\u00f3ricos de los conflictos al momento de predecir tendencias a largo plazo. La RNN es una herramienta de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico sencilla, pero poderosa, para la predicci\u00f3n de series temporales debido a su capacidad para aprender secuencias extensas de informaci\u00f3n. Los resultados demuestran que el modelo genera pron\u00f3sticos relativamente precisos en los Estados d\u00e9biles y fallidos, lo cual coincide con las investigaciones existentes sobre las \u201ctrampas de conflictos.\u201d No obstante, el modelo presenta dificultades para predecir nuevos conflictos civiles; esto es coincidente con las teor\u00edas informativas sobre el inicio de conflictos. Los resultados brindan lecciones importantes para la predicci\u00f3n de conflictos y demuestran oportunidades para las aplicaciones de RNN en futuras investigaciones sobre ciencias pol\u00edticas.

            "abstract": "In the past decade, several efforts have been made to project armed conflict risk into the future. This study broadens current approaches by presenting a first-of-its-kind application of machine learning (ML) methods to project sub-national armed conflict risk over the African continent along three Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways towards 2050. Results of the open-source ML framework CoPro are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with Random Forest classifiers agree with the patterns observed in comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low in most regions although the Horn of Africa and parts of East Africa continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk increases in the more adverse SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in Central Africa and large parts of Western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited compared to main conflict predictors but results suggest that changing climatic conditions may both increase and decrease conflict risk, depending on the location: in Northern Africa and large parts of Eastern Africa climate change increases projected conflict risk whereas for areas in the West and northern part of the Sahel shifting climatic conditions may reduce conflict risk. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we identify various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the limited selection of relevant quantified indicators for the SSPs at present. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable and scalable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.",

They claim that our theoretically-informed model of conflict escalation under-performs more mechanical, inductive alternatives. This claim is false. BM&W\u2019s critiques are misguided or inconsequential, and their conclusions hinge on a minor technical question regarding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves: should the curves be smoothed, or should empirical curves be used? BM&W assert that empirical curves should be used and all of their conclusions depend on this subjective modeling choice. We extend our original analysis to show that our theoretically-informed model performs as well as or better than more atheoretical alternatives across a range of performance metrics and robustness specifications. As in our original article, we conclude by encouraging conflict forecasters to treat the value added of theory not as an assumption, but rather as a hypothesis to test.",

            "abstract": "We examine the research protocols in Blair and Sambanis\u2019 recent article on forecasting civil wars, where they argue that their theory-based model can predict civil war onsets better than several atheoretical alternatives or a model with country-structural factors. We find that there are several important mistakes and that their key finding is entirely conditional on the use of parametrically smoothed ROC curves when calculating accuracy, rather than the standard empirical ROC curves that dominate the literature. Fixing these mistakes results in a reversal of their claim that theory-based models of escalation are better at predicting onsets of civil war than other kinds of models. Their model is outperformed by several of the ad hoc, putatively non-theoretical models they devise and examine. More importantly, we argue that rather than trying to contrast the roles of theory and \u201catheoretical\u201d machine learning in predictive modeling, it would be more productive to focus on ways in which predictive modeling and machine learning could be used to strengthen extant predictive work. Instead, we argue that predictive modeling and machine learning are effective tools for theory testing.",

            "abstract": "Building on previous research on the use of macroeconomic factors for conflict prediction and using data on political instability provided by the Political Instability Task Force, this article proposes two minimal forecasting models of political instability optimised to have the greatest possible predictive power for one-year and two-year event horizons, while still making predictions that are fully explainable. Both models employ logistic regression and use just three predictors: polity code (a measure of government type), infant mortality, and years of stability (i.e., years since the last instability event). These models make predictions for 176 countries on a country-year basis and achieve AUPRC\u2019s of 0.108 and 0.115 for the one-year and two-year models respectively. They use public data with ongoing availability so are readily reproducible. They use Monte Carlo simulations to construct confidence intervals for their predictions and are validated by testing their predictions for a set of reference years separate from the set of reference years used to train them. This validation shows that the models are not overfitted but suggests that some of the previous models in the literature may have been. The models developed in this article are able to explain their predictions by showing, for a given prediction, which predictors were the most influential and by using counterfactuals to show how the predictions would have been altered had these predictors taken different values. These models are compared to models created by lasso regression and it is shown that they have at least as good predictive power but that their predictions can be more readily explained. Because policy makers are more likely to be influenced by models whose predictions can explained, the more interpretable a model is the more likely it is to influence policy.",

            "title": "Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodel Regression for Network Data: Application to International Militarized Conflicts",
            "abstract": "Abstract The decision to engage in military conflict is shaped by many factors, including state- and dyad-level characteristics as well as the state\u2019s membership in geopolitical coalitions. Supporters of the democratic peace theory, for example, hypothesize that the community of democratic states is less likely to wage war with each other. Such theories explain the ways in which nodal and dyadic characteristics affect the evolution of conflict patterns over time via their effects on group memberships. To test these arguments, we develop a dynamic model of network data by combining a hidden Markov model with a mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel that identifies latent groups underlying the network structure. Unlike existing models, we incorporate covariates that predict dynamic node memberships in latent groups as well as the direct formation of edges between dyads. While prior substantive research often assumes the decision to engage in international militarized conflict is independent across states and static over time, we demonstrate that conflict is driven by states\u2019 evolving membership in geopolitical blocs. Our analysis of militarized disputes from 1816 to 2010 identifies two distinct blocs of democratic states, only one of which exhibits unusually low rates of conflict. Changes in monadic covariates like democracy shift states between coalitions, making some states more pacific but others more belligerent.

While democracies are less coup-prone, studies treating civilian control as a dependent variable mostly focus on coups.

To capture this difference, I advance a new comprehensive framework that includes the erosion of civilian control by competition, insubordination, and deference. I test the argument under conditions of an intrastate conflict\u2014a conducive environment for the erosion of civilian control. A large-N analysis confirms that while intrastate conflict does not lead to coups in democracies, it increases the military\u2019s involvement in government, pointing to alternative forms of erosion taking place.

We evaluate the ability of this study to predict observed conflicts in the 2010\u20132018 period, using multiple metrics. We also evaluate the original performance evaluation, i.e., whether the performance measures presented by Hegre et\u00a0al. hold in this new 9-year window. Overall, we conclude that Hegre et\u00a0al. were able to produce meaningful and reasonably accurate predictions of armed conflict. Of course, they did not always hit the mark. We find that the model has performed worse in predicting low level incidence of conflict than in predicting major armed conflict. The model also failed to predict some important broader regional shifts. These, however, represent important insights for future research and illustrate the utility in predictive models for both testing and developing theory.",

            "abstract": "The integrated character of the sustainable development goals in Agenda 2030, as well as research in environmental security, flag that sustainable peace requires sustainable and conflict-sensitive natural resource use. The precise relationship between the risk for violent conflict and natural resources remains contested because of the interplay with socio-economic variables. This paper aims to improve the understanding of natural resources\u2019 role in the risk of violent conflicts by accounting for complex interactions with socio-economic conditions. Conflict data was analysed with machine learning techniques, which can account for complex patterns, such as variable interactions. More commonly used logistic regression models are compared with neural network models and random forest models. The results indicate that a country\u2019s natural resource features are important predictors of its risk for violent conflict and that they interact with socio-economic conditions. Based on these empirical results and the existing literature, we interpret that natural resources can be root causes of violent intrastate conflict, and that signals from natural resources leading to conflict risk are reflected in and influenced by interacting socio-economic conditions. More specifically, the results show that variables such as access to water and food security are important predictors of conflict, while resource rents and oil and ore exports are relatively less important than other natural resource variables, contrasting what prior research has suggested. Given the potential of natural resource features to act as an early warning for violent conflict, we argue that natural resources should be included in conflict risk models for conflict prevention.",

A nation in conflict may evolve very differently to one that is not. Using a unique set of open-source data, a suite of region-specific models are developed that predict nation-state transitions into and out of violent conflict. Conflict transition predictor variables differ not only between the regions, but also within each region dependent on if a nation is identified as in conflict or not. Accurate modeling of complex regional environments is achieved with parsimonious and interpretable models. While we ensure the causal variables of the previous study are considered for inclusion in the models developed, this paper focuses on the ability to accurately predict conflict over individual independent variable analysis.",

One of the most frequent tasks is to build statistical models using historical data and utilize them to predict new, so far unclassified, cases. This article examines the problem of predicting a military interstate dispute between two states (dyad) by employing selected data mining techniques. Suitable methods are identified and applied to the existing dataset of politically relevant dyads. The result is the building of statistical models for the classification of potential dyadic conflicts. The overall performance of these models is verified and cost analysis is done based on the different impacts of incorrect classification. The results are compared with those of other published research studies in the field of conflict prediction; the models created by data mining techniques significantly outperform all rival algorithms and approaches. Finally, the last part of the article presents the results of applying data mining techniques to association, i.e. to discovering relationships and dependencies in the data.",

We use event data to show that a parsimonious model grounded in prominent theories of conflict escalation can forecast civil war onset with high accuracy and over shorter temporal windows than has generally been possible. Our forecasting model draws on \u201cprocedural\u201d variables, building on insights from the contentious politics literature. We show that a procedural model outperforms more inductive, atheoretical alternatives and also outperforms models based on countries\u2019 structural characteristics, which previously dominated models of civil war onset. We find that process can substitute for structure over short forecasting windows. We also find a more direct connection between theory and forecasting than is sometimes assumed, though we suggest that future researchers treat the value-added of theory for prediction not as an assumption but rather as a hypothesis to test.",

            "abstract": "Societies emerging from internal armed conflicts display surprising variation in the degree to which governments protect human rights. Employing new data on civilian victimization by both government and rebel forces, we find that the human rights climate of a post-conflict country is not simply a perpetuation of pre-conflict conditions, or the result of repressive regimes remaining in power. Instead, the treatment of civilians during conflict has an independent impact on post-conflict human rights protections (HRP). Analyses of ninety-six post-conflict periods (1960\u20132015) show that when governments systematically and extensively target civilians during counterinsurgency campaigns, post-conflict human rights conditions decline substantially compared to pre-conflict levels, even accounting for other predictors of human rights violations, including pre-conflict human rights conditions. This holds regardless of who is in power after conflicts end. These findings have implications for theoreticalmodels of repression and conflict cycles, and for practitioners and policymakers aiming to restore and protect human rights after war.",

We argue that food price volatilities affect the incentives of insurgent groups and their subsequent treatment of civilians. The hypotheses developed in this study are empirically evaluated across a battery of statistical models using monthly data from a sample of 112 first administrative districts in sub-Saharan Africa. The results show that increases in food insecurity substantially raise the likelihood of insurgent groups committing violence against civilians and that districts with a higher proportion of agricultural land are at greatest risk of civilian victimization by rebel groups during these episodes of food insecurity. The implications of this analysis suggest that the human impact of food insecurity does not simply relate to nutrition and questions of governance. Food price volatilities also incentivize the use of violence against civilians by non-state actors, which is a pertinent concern of human rights organizations and policymakers.",

Existing data sets have facilitated advances in understanding and policy-relevant applications such as forecasting but have been criticized for insufficient transparency, replicability, and for omitting failed or prevented attempts at genocide/politicide. More general data sets of mass civilian killing do not typically enable users to isolate situations in which specific groups are deliberately targeted. The Targeted Mass Killing (TMK) data set identifies 201 TMK episodes, 1946 to 2017, with annualized information on perpetrator intent, severity, targeted groups, and new ordinal and binary indicators of genocide/politicide that can serve as alternatives to existing measures. Users are also able to construct their own indicators based on their research questions or preferred definitions. The article discusses the concept and operationalization of TMK, provides comparisons with other data sets, and highlights some of the strengths and new capabilities of the TMK data.",

However, conflict research\u2013 the empirical examination of political unrest, violence and civil war\u2013has seen a growing emphasis on prediction and forecasting models. We describe automated machine learning (AutoML) to identify models, and human-guided machine learning (HGML), and show how these can incorporate domain knowledge and research requirements into model selection and assessment, and provide high quality machine learning pipelines to domain experts comparable to state-of-the-literature solutions. We examine three peer-reviewed papers with predictive models of conflict [3, 4, 5] and run their data through our HGML system using multiple AutoML engines and find this system produces slightly elevated performance on each paper\u2019s model, without any ML expertise required of the user. Our research has three takeaways for computational social science. First, predictive models of conflict would benefit from even minimal applications of AutoML; Secondly, human-guided machine learning offers the attractive option of constraining AutoML systems to address the kinds of questions conflict researchers assess with predictive models; Finally, current existing AutoML implementations produce divergent solutions and so can be productively harnessed in parallel.",

Here we study escalation patterns using recent machine-learning methods derived from information geometry, clustering, and pattern recognition in time series. Our goal is to supplement typical correlation-based approaches with clustering and prototyping methods to extract shapes and ideally better understand the patterns of escalation into war. We apply these methods to a particularly challenging task: forecasting the precise timing of Palestinian rocket and mortar attacks on Israel. Using four years of minutelevel prices for 500 Israeli stocks, we find that financial asset prices react on average 30 minutes ahead of the launch of a rocket. We validate our result in a true out-of-sample manner. Using live market data and minute-level rocket attack data from Israel\u2019s home front command, we publicly broadcast our forecasts in real time for every minute of every day.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Civil wars greatly vary in the number of refugees they generate, ranging from zero to over six millions in a given conflict. Work on this variation has largely focused on \u201cpush\u201d factors \u2013 deleterious attributes of the home country that lead to refugee flows, such as violence and repression. Yet, few have studied the importance of \u201cpull\u201d factors \u2013 attractive features of the potential host countries. Here we show in particular the importance of the expected quality of life in possible destinations. Using data on civil wars from 1951 to 2008, we find that the proximity of democratic and wealthy potential hosts accounts for much of the variation in the number of refugees. Out-of-sample validation methods show that these \u201cpull\u201d factors account for nearly as much predictive power as all the main variables previously identified in the literature combined.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Previous research by Goldstone et al. (2010) generated a highly accurate predictive model of state-level political instability. Notably, this model identifies political institutions \u2013 and partial democracy with factionalism, specifically \u2013 as the most compelling factors explaining when and where instability events are likely to occur. This article reassesses the model\u2019s explanatory power and makes three related points: (1) the model\u2019s predictive power varies substantially over time; (2) its predictive power peaked in the period used for out-of-sample validation (1995\u20132004) in the original study and (3) the model performs relatively poorly in the more recent period. The authors find that this decline is not simply due to the Arab Uprisings, instability events that occurred in autocracies. Similar issues are found with attempts to predict nonviolent uprisings (Chenoweth and Ulfelder 2017) and armed conflict onset and continuation (Hegre et al. 2013). These results inform two conclusions: (1) the drivers of instability are not constant over time and (2) care must be exercised in interpreting prediction exercises as evidence in favor or dispositive of theoretical mechanisms.",

            "title": "A History of Possible Futures: Multipath Forecasting of Social Breakdown, Recovery, and Resilience",
            "abstract": "Recent years have seen major political crises throughout the world, and foreign policy analysts nearly universally expect to see rising tensions within (and between) countries in the next 5\u201320 years. Being able to predict future crises and to assess the resilience of different countries to various shocks is of foremost importance in averting the potentially huge human costs of state collapse and civil war. The premise of this paper is that a transdisciplinary approach to forecasting social breakdown, recovery, and resilience is entirely feasible, as a result of recent breakthroughs in statistical analysis of large-scale historical data, the qualitative insights of historical and semiotic investigations, and agent-based models that translate between micro-dynamics of interacting individuals and the collective macro-level events emerging from these interactions. Our goal is to construct a series of probabilistic scenarios of social breakdown and recovery, based on historical crises and outcomes, which can aid the analysis of potential outcomes of future crises. We call this approach\u2014similar in spirit to ensemble forecasting in weather prediction\u2014multipath forecasting (MPF). This paper aims to set out the methodological premises and basic stages envisaged to realize this goal within a transdisciplinary research collaboration: first, the statistical analysis of a massive database of past instances of crisis to determine how actual outcomes (the severity of disruption and violence, the speed of resolution) depend on inputs (economic, political, and cultural factors); second, the encoding of these analytical insights into probabilistic, empirically informed computational models of societal breakdown and recovery\u2014the MPF engine; third, testing the MPF engine to \u201cpredict\u201d the trajectories and outcomes of another set of past social upheavals, which were not used in building the model. This \u201chistorical retrodiction\u201d is an innovation that will allow us to further refine the MPF technology. Ultimately our vision is to use MPF to help write what we call \u201ca history of possible futures,\u201d in which the near- and medium-term paths of societies are probabilistically forecast.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the current wave of renewed interest in conflict prevention, we argue that key lessons from 20 years of practice and research have not been learned yet. Official documents and parts of the literature are too often confined to a technocratic understanding of conflict prevention drawing on positivist conflict forecasting (science) and toolbox approaches to \u201cwhat works\u201d (craft). Moreover, wishful thinking affects the expected influence of external actors as well as warning-response dynamics within organizations. Drawing on extensive research we elaborate on how the \u201cart\u201d dimension of conflict prevention can advance research and practice of three important fields: forecasting and early warning, organizational and decision-making structures, and diplomacy and engagement strategies. The paper argues for paying closer attention to informal, individual, and political dimensions of prevention and a more fine-grained understanding of how art, craft, and science approaches can complement each other.",

            "abstract": "It is still unknown whether there is some deep structure to modern wars and terrorist campaigns that could, for example, enable reliable prediction of future patterns of violent events. Recent war research focuses on size distributions of violent events, with size defined by the number of people killed in each event. Event size distributions within previously available datasets, for both armed conflicts and for global terrorism as a whole, exhibit extraordinary regularities that transcend specifics of time and place. These distributions have been well modelled by a narrow range of power laws that are, in turn, supported by some theories of violent group dynamics. We show that the predicted event-size patterns emerge broadly in a mass of new event data covering all conflicts in the world from 1989 to 2016. Moreover, there are similar regularities in the events generated by individual terrorist organizations, 1998\u20142016. The existence of such robust empirical patterns hints at the predictability of size distributions of violent events in future wars. We pursue this prospect using split-sample techniques that help us to make useful out-of-sample predictions. Power-law-based prediction systems outperform lognormal-based systems. We conclude that there is indeed evidence from the existing data that fundamental patterns do exist, and that these can allow prediction of size distribution of events in modern wars and terrorist campaigns.",

The parameters of this highly parameterized model are estimated through simulated annealing. We consider data for 2012 to 2016 to calibrate the model for four African regions separately, and we consider the data for 2017 to evaluate the forecasts. These forecasts concern the amount of future large events as well as their locations. Examples of our findings are that the model predicts a cluster of large events in the Central Africa region, which was not expected based on past events, and that in particular for East Africa it apparently holds that small conflicts can trigger a larger number of conflicts.",

            "abstract": "Anti-Semitism, hostility towards or the maltreatment of Jews, is one of the oldest forms of intolerance. Scholars from a variety of traditions have examined anti-Semitism and its drivers. This project interrogates the drivers of anti-Semitism in a new way. It looks at how anti-Semitism is related to an under-examined variable, country stability. I hypothesize that feelings of instability will drive individuals and groups towards espousing anti-Semitic attitudes. Particular attention is paid to political instability as manifested in immigration levels, regime duration, conflict and terrorism. Three hypotheses are tested through the use of OLS regression and a dataset that brings together 2014 cross-national data on anti-Semitic attitudes with country-level variables that act as indirect indicators of political instability. Major findings include statistically significant impacts of (1) a country\u2019s presence in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region (2) a regime\u2019s duration and (3) terrorism outside of the MENA region on levels of anti-Semitic attitudes. This research has implications for understanding the ongoing study of the drivers of anti-Semitism, particularly country-level drivers.",

            "abstract": "Activists have used social media during modern civil uprisings, and researchers have found that the generated content is predictive of off-line protest activity. However, questions remain regarding the drivers of this predictive power. In this paper, we begin by deriving predictor variables for individuals\u2019 protest decisions from the literature on protest participation theory. We then test these variables on the case of Twitter and the 2011 Egyptian revolution. We find significant positive correlations between the volume of future-protest descriptions on Twitter and protest onsets. We do not find significant correlations between such onsets and the preceding volume of political expressions, individuals\u2019 access to news, and connections with political activists. These results locate the predictive power of social media in its function as a protest advertisement and organization mechanism. We then build predictive models using future-protest descriptions and compare these models with baselines informed by daily event counts from the Global Database of Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT). Inspection of the significant variables in our GDELT models reveals that an increased military presence may be predictive of protest onsets in major cities. In sum, this paper highlights the ways in which online activism shapes off-line behavior during civil uprisings.",

            "abstract": "Civil wars greatly vary in the number of refugees they generate, ranging from zero to over six millions in a given conflict. Work on this variation has largely focused on 'push' factors--deleterious attributes of the home country that lead to refugee flows, such as violence and repression. Yet, few have studied the importance of 'pull' factors--attractive features of the potential host countries. Here we show in particular the importance of the expected quality of life in possible destinations. Using data on civil wars from 1951 to 2008, we find that the proximity of democratic and wealthy potential hosts accounts for much of the variation in the number of refugees. In fact, we show using out-of-sample validation that these 'pull' factors account for almost as much of the predictive power as a combination of all the main variables previously identified in the literature.",

            "abstract": "The literature on civil war onset focuses on the effect of oil on domestic actors but relatively little suggests its effect on external actors who can intervene in an oil-producing state, although most revenues of oil-producing states are generated by their oil export to other states. This article advances a theory of oil export, external prewar support for the government, and civil war onset. In the international oil market, although oil is a primary energy source in most states, there are few oil exporters. This implies that costs of breaking an oil trade tie are greater for an oil-importing state vis-\u00e0-vis an oil-exporting state and, thus, oil-importing states are likely to have concerns about oil-exporting states\u2019 political instability that can cause civil conflict onset and break their oil trade ties. I hypothesize that a state\u2019s oil export increases the likelihood of external prewar support for its government. However, because oil-exporting states are likely to conceal the information about their oil export to prevent public grievances against the distribution of oil revenues and their governments\u2019 incompetence in oil export, rebels are less likely to have complete information about oil export. The secrecy of oil export hinders finding a mutually acceptable bargaining range between the government and rebels, and increases the likelihood of civil conflict onset in oil-exporting states without external support for the government. I measure each state\u2019s oil export using network analysis, and test these hypotheses using logit models. Empirical results support the hypotheses.",

We have created four civil war onset models using data from 1979-1999 (in sample), which we then use to predict the onset of civil war from 2000-2015 (out-of-sample). Our time horizon is one month into the future. The predictive performance of our best model as measured by its area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.881. All 24 conflict onsets between 2000-2015 occurred within countries in the top half of our risk ranking, with 79% of these onsets falling in the top 20% category, and 58% in the top 10% category. Our findings suggest that models incorporating both structural and automated event data have significantly stronger predictive power than those that rely exclusively on structural data. Conclusions and guidelines for future research are provided on the basis of our results.",

            "abstract": "We examine if dynamic information from event data can help improve on a model attempting to forecast civil war using measures reflecting plausible motivation and grievances. Buhaug, Cederman, and Gleditsch predict the risk of civil war using a horizontal inequality model with measures reflecting motivation and relevant group characteristics at the country level. The predictions from their model outperform in an out-of-sample forecast conventional country-level models of civil war, emphasizing vertical inequality and country characteristics. However, most grievance measures change little over time. We surmise that a model reflecting potential motivation for conflict can be improved with more dynamic information on mobilization and the behavior of actors. Our conjecture receives some support in the empirical analysis, where we consider both conflict onset and termination over territorial and governmental incompatibilities in the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Data, and find some evidence that event data can help improve forecasts. Moreover, models with the original grievance measures do better than purely event based models, supporting our claim that both structure and event based components can add value to conflict prediction models. However, the contribution of events to improving predictive power is modest and not entirely consistent, and some types of conflict events seem easier to forecast than others.",

We introduce the idea of an autologistic model where the response for one observation is dependent on the value of the response among adjacent observations. The autologistic model has likelihood function that is mathematically intractable, since the observations are conditionally dependent upon one another. We review alternative techniques for estimating this model, with special emphasis on recent advances using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We evaluate a highly simplified autologistic model of conflict where the likelihood of war involvement for each nation is conditional on the war involvement of proximate states. We estimate this autologistic model for a single year (1988) via maximum pseudolikelihood and MCMC maximum likelihood methods. Our results indicate that the autologistic model fits the data much better than an unconditional model and that the MCMC estimates generally dominate the pseudolikelihood estimates. The autologistic model generates predicted probabilities greater than 0.5 and has relatively good predictive abilities in an out-of-sample forecast for the subsequent decade (1989 to 1998), correctly identifying not only ongoing conflicts, but also new ones.",

The theory, a mobilization of discontent model, argues that the extent of open political conflict within nations is a function of popular discontent, popular dispositions toward conflict, and the balance of organizational strengt between challengers and the regime. In order to examine the forecasting power of this argument, two competing and less elaborate models of domestic political conflict are also proposed. One, a model of the conflict process, forms linkages between the extent and intensity of conflict. The other is a truly naive model, which represents only a persistence of conflit argument. All three models are used to forecast conflict for 10 randomly selected nations in 1971-1975, and implications for the modelling of domestic political conflict are drawn.",

This paper presents the resu lts of a new study, using case-control methods, to identify risk factors for political instability two years prior to event onset. The models we derive are surprisingly simple, and yet are able to identify states that will or will not experience political instability two years hence with over 80% accuracy in the historical data across several random samples. Using global data from 1955 to 200 3, we examine a wide range of political upheavals and demonstrate that regime type is overw helmingly the dominant factor behind revolutions, ethnic wars, and adverse regime change s. However, the effect of regime type is not a simple function of the degree of democracy or autoc racy. Rather, certain kinds of autocracies and democracies are much more vulnerable than other s, d pending on the patterns of executive recruitment and political participation under those regimes.",

            "abstract": "In the world of cyber defense, anticipating potential attacks or any increase in risk of attacks is one of the most advantageous pieces of knowledge one can have. However, little research has been done in examining the larger geopolitical environment and using data sources available at the geopolitical level to predict cyberattacks in advance. To this end, we combine the use of a geopolitical conflict dataset, ICEWS, in combination with a cyberattack dataset from the Council on Foreign Relations to determine if we can predict cyberattacks targeting a given nation. We present a novel approach to identify periods of increased likelihood of cyberattacks at the country, regional, and global levels. The approach involves creating a news-based political event graph, generating vectorial representations of the graph using the SIR-GN structural iterative representation learning approach, and applying novelty detection models to predict future nation-initiated attacks. The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines for majority of cases in terms of F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting cyberattacks.",

Yet, the literature lacks direct and systematic evidence of its effect. This is largely due to challenges with accessing decision-makers\u2019 private and often confidential information and opinions. We compile a large corpus of declassified French diplomatic cables that span the period 1871\u20131914. Using these texts, we estimate a dynamic topic model to generate diplomatic thematic variables, which are then used to forecast the onset of French Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs). The inclusion of information from diplomatic correspondence greatly improves estimates of MID timing, compared to models that rely solely on public information such as structural determinants and revealed risk perceptions derived from financial markets or the press. These results emphasize the importance of private information in decisions to go to war and the limitations of empirical work that relies solely on publicly available data.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article illustrates an approach to forecasting change in conflict fatalities designed to address the complexity of the drivers and processes of armed conflicts. The design of this approach is based on two main choices. First, to account for the specificity of conflict drivers and processes over time and space, we model conflicts in each individual country separately. Second, we draw on an adaptive model\u2014Dynamic Elastic Net, DynENet\u2014which is able to efficiently select relevant predictors among a large set of covariates. We include over 700 variables in our models, adding event data on top of the data features provided by the convenors of the forecasting competition. We show that our approach is suitable and computationally efficient enough to address the complexity of conflict dynamics. Moreover, the adaptive nature of our model brings a significant added value. Because for each country our model only selects the variables that are relevant to predict conflict intensity, the retained predictors can be analyzed to describe the dynamic configuration of conflict drivers both across countries and within countries over time. Countries can then be clustered to observe the emergence of broader patterns related to correlates of conflict. In this sense, our approach produces interpretable forecasts, addressing one key limitation of contemporary approaches to forecasting.",

            "title": "Click, click boom: Using Wikipedia data to predict changes in battle-related deaths",
            "abstract": "Abstract Data and methods development are key to improve our ability to forecast conflict. Relatively recent data sources such as mobile phone and social media data or images have received widespread attention in conflict research. Oftentimes these do not cover substantial parts of the globe or they are difficult to obtain and manipulate, which makes regular updating challenging. The sometimes vast amounts of data can also be computationally and financially costly. The data source we propose instead is cheap, readily and openly available, and updated in real time, and it provides global coverage: Wikipedia. We argue that the number of country page views can be considered a measure of interest or salience, whereas the number of page changes can be considered a measure of controversy between competing political views. We expect these predictors to be particularly successful in capturing tensions before a conflict escalates. We test our argument by predicting changes in battle-related deaths in Africa on the country-month level. We find evidence that country page views do increase predictive performance while page changes do not. Contrary to our expectation, our model seems to capture long-term trends better than sharp short-term changes. El desarrollo de datos y m\u00e9todos es fundamental para perfeccionar nuestra habilidad de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos. Las fuentes de datos relativamente nuevas, tales como los datos o las im\u00e1genes de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares y de las redes sociales, han recibido una atenci\u00f3n generalizada en la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos. A menudo, dichas fuentes no cubren las partes primordiales del mundo o son dif\u00edciles de obtener y manejar, lo que hace que la actualizaci\u00f3n peri\u00f3dica sea un desaf\u00edo. Las cantidades de datos, en ocasiones enormes, tambi\u00e9n pueden ser costosas desde el punto de vista inform\u00e1tico y financiero. En su lugar, la fuente de datos que proponemos es econ\u00f3mica, est\u00e1 disponible f\u00e1cil y p\u00fablicamente, se actualiza en tiempo real y proporciona una cobertura global: Wikipedia. Planteamos que la cantidad de p\u00e1ginas vistas por pa\u00eds puede considerarse una medida de inter\u00e9s o prominencia, mientras que el n\u00famero de cambios de p\u00e1gina puede considerarse una medida de controversia entre las opiniones pol\u00edticas rivales. Esperamos que estos indicadores tengan especial \u00e9xito a la hora de captar las tensiones antes de que el conflicto se intensifique. Ponemos a prueba nuestro argumento prediciendo cambios en las muertes relacionadas con las batallas en \u00c1frica a nivel mensual y por pa\u00eds. Encontramos pruebas de que esas p\u00e1ginas vistas por pa\u00eds aumentan el rendimiento predictivo, mientras que los cambios de p\u00e1gina no lo hacen. Al contrario de lo que esper\u00e1bamos, nuestro modelo parece registrar mejor las tendencias a largo plazo que los cambios bruscos a corto plazo. Les donn\u00e9es et le d\u00e9veloppement des m\u00e9thodes sont essentiels \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de notre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir les conflits. La recherche sur les conflits a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 avec application des sources de donn\u00e9es relativement r\u00e9centes, telles que celles fournies par les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones portables ou les m\u00e9dias sociaux. N\u00e9anmoins, dans de nombreux cas, les donn\u00e9es obtenues n\u2019englobent pas l\u2019ensemble de la plan\u00e8te. Elles sont parfois difficiles \u00e0 obtenir et sont d\u00e9licates \u00e0 manipuler, ce qui rend difficile toute mise \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. En outre, du fait de leur quantit\u00e9, l\u2019analyse de ces donn\u00e9es peut \u00eatre chronophage et co\u00fbteuse. Au contraire, la source de donn\u00e9es que nous proposons est bon march\u00e9, publique et imm\u00e9diatement disponible, mise \u00e0 jour en temps r\u00e9el, et inclut l\u2019ensemble de la plan\u00e8te : Wikip\u00e9dia. Nous soutenons que le nombre de pages vues par pays permet de mesurer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou l\u2019importance d\u2019un sujet, tandis que le nombre de changements apport\u00e9s aux pages permet de mesurer le niveau de controverses entre des opinions politiques concurrentes. Nous estimons que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments permettent d\u2019identifier avec succ\u00e8s des tensions avant qu\u2019un conflit n\u2019\u00e9clate. Nous v\u00e9rifions la justesse de nos hypoth\u00e8ses en pr\u00e9disant des changements en ce qui concerne le nombre de victimes dans des combats en Afrique, par pays et par mois. Nous apportons la preuve que le nombre de pages vues par pays a une valeur pr\u00e9dictive, mais que le nombre de changements apport\u00e9s aux pages n\u2019en a pas. Contrairement \u00e0 nos attentes, notre mod\u00e8le semble permettre d\u2019identifier des tendances de long terme, et non des changements soudains de court terme.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper explores three different model components to improve predictive performance over the ViEWS benchmark: a class of neural networks that account for spatial and temporal dependencies; the use of CAMEO-coded event data; and the continuous rank probability score (CRPS), which is a proper scoring metric. We forecast changes in state based violence across Africa at the grid-month level. The results show that spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network models offer consistent improvements over the benchmark. The CAMEO-coded event data sometimes improve performance, but sometimes decrease performance. Finally, the choice of performance metric, whether it be the mean squared error or a proper metric such as the CRPS, has an impact on model selection. Each of these components\u2013algorithms, measures, and metrics\u2013can improve our forecasts and understanding of violence. En este art\u00edculo se exploran tres componentes diferentes del modelo para mejorar el rendimiento predictivo con respecto a la referencia ViEWS: una clase de redes neuronales que tienen en cuenta las dependencias espaciales y temporales, el uso de datos de eventos codificados por CAMEO, y la puntuaci\u00f3n de probabilidad de rango continuo (CRPS), que es una m\u00e9trica de puntuaci\u00f3n adecuada. Predecimos los cambios en la violencia estatal en toda \u00c1frica a nivel mensual. Los resultados muestran que los modelos de redes neuronales convolucionales de gr\u00e1ficos espacio-temporales ofrecen mejoras consistentes sobre el punto de referencia. Los datos de eventos codificados por CAMEO a veces mejoran el rendimiento, pero otras veces lo empeoran. Por \u00faltimo, la elecci\u00f3n de la m\u00e9trica de rendimiento, ya sea el error cuadr\u00e1tico medio o una m\u00e9trica propia como la CRPS, influye en la selecci\u00f3n del modelo. Cada uno de estos componentes (algoritmos, medidas y m\u00e9tricas) puede mejorar nuestras previsiones y nuestra comprensi\u00f3n de la violencia. Cet article explore trois composantes de mod\u00e8les diff\u00e9rentes pour am\u00e9liorer les performances pr\u00e9dictives par rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) : une classe de r\u00e9seaux de neurones qui prennent en compte les d\u00e9pendances spatiales et temporelles ; l\u2019utilisation de donn\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements cod\u00e9es par CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Events Observations, Observation des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de m\u00e9diation et de conflit) ; et le CRPS (Continuous Rank Probability Score, Score de probabilit\u00e9 de cat\u00e9gories ordonn\u00e9es de variables continues), qui est une m\u00e9trique de score propre. Nous effectuons des pr\u00e9dictions des \u00e9volutions de la violence \u00e9tatique en Afrique au niveau grille/mois. Les r\u00e9sultats montrent que les mod\u00e8les \u00e0 r\u00e9seaux convolutifs de neurones graphiques spatiotemporels offrent des am\u00e9liorations constantes par rapport \u00e0 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Les donn\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements cod\u00e9es par CAMEO am\u00e9liorent parfois les performances mais peuvent aussi parfois les r\u00e9duire. Enfin, le choix de la m\u00e9trique de performances, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de l\u2019erreur quadratique moyenne ou d\u2019une m\u00e9trique de score propre telle que le CRPS, a un impact sur la s\u00e9lection du mod\u00e8le. Chacune de ces composantes - algorithmes, mesures et m\u00e9triques - peut am\u00e9liorer nos pr\u00e9visions et notre compr\u00e9hension de la violence.",

            "title": "Measuring the risk of immigration related conflicts",
            "abstract": "There has been widespread concern among policymakers that intensive immigration can drive anti-immigrant attitudes, which may further develop into ethnic strife. In order to systematically monitor immigration-related conflict in society, the authors have constructed a theoretical composite conflict risk index for measuring immigration-related conflict risk at a subnational level. The index is called MICRI, short for immigration-related conflict risk index. The index offers new input to the quantitative conflict risk modelling by including subjective indicators, which usually are missing from risk indices, along with objective indicators. The reason behind that is the growing understanding between scholars that groups \u0301 perceived grievances play an important role in whether a conflict arises or not. Therefore, capturing the subjective \u201cfeelings\u201d of a group allows us to go closer to the source of conflict, and help to generate a better out-come in risk predictions. Thus, MICRI consists of 17 indicators, out of which thirteen (13) are subjective and four (4) are objective indicators. The data was sourced from the European Social Survey and national statistical database. These sources met the criteria set for data: the data includes information about all the main risk dimensions, including the subjective perceptions of persons; and the data is regularly updated, reliable, provides regional level information and is easily accessible for international use. The article presents the methodology and data behind the indicators, evaluates the index \u0301s internal consistency using the quantitative regional level data of 75 Estonian municipalities. In constructing the values of MICRI, we followed four consecutive steps: (1) computing the values of the indicators for each municipality; (2) normalising; (3) weighting; and (4) aggregating of the indicators. All indicator were compiled in ten different risk dimensions \u2013 identity, distrust, value difference, perceived threat, perceived inequality, dissatisfaction, poor communication, low norm obedience, availability of resources, and regional immigration level \u2013 which formed a cumulative index value. The validity of the index was controlled with data of (75) Estonian municipalities from the period 2014 \u2013 2018. The results of initial testing show that the internal consistency of MICRI is good; c-alpha = 0.698, which indicates a good potential for the index \u0301s performance. The future research will focus on external validation of the index and will expand its use internationally.",

            "abstract": "Anticipated shifts in power favoring one side can lead to preventive war today. When power is poised to shift towards the state, potential rebels may launch a civil war while they retain a relative advantage, consistent with the commitment problem. We argue that a government expecting a group to rebel has an incentive to prevent that challenge by repressing the population. Repression is a government attempt to undermine and prevent dissent that would turn into rebellion\u2014dissent and rebellion that is more likely in expectation of power shifting in the government\u2019s favor. Empirical models using data on newly proved oil reserves show that states expecting an increase in oil wealth demonstrably increase repression in the years between discovery and access. The findings imply a new connection between natural resources and political violence: Oil wealth can encourage repression not only by reducing its costs, but also by creating windows of opportunity that rebels hope to exploit and governments hope to close. Not only civil war but also rising expectations of rebellion are associated with a marked increase in state-directed violence against civilians.",

            "title": "Forecasting conflict using a diverse machine-learning ensemble: Ensemble averaging with multiple tree-based algorithms and variance promoting data configurations",
            "abstract": "Abstract The article examines the potential of multi-model ensemble learning techniques for conflict research and applies an ensemble averaging framework to the prediction task of the 2020 ViEWS armed conflict forecasting competition. The goal is to predict changes of conflict intensity in fifty-four African countries for 6 months into the future. The presented ensemble combines six individual models, using two tree-based learning algorithms, incorporating two distinct data foundations and two geographical selections into a unified forecasting framework. In one of the two applied datasets, the combination of conflict variables from recent months is implemented to train for inter-temporal connections of previous conflict levels. The second dataset contains important structural, economic, political, and social information relevant for each individual case. Both datasets are used to predict changes in conflict levels. The framework structure and the combination method are presented in detail, and the prediction results for both test periods between 2014\u20132016 and 2016\u20132019 are evaluated regarding their quality. The effect of the ensemble structure and the performance of all individual components is comprehensively examined. Real forecasts over the timespan of six months into the future are presented for the upcoming months of October 2020 through March 2021 generated from data available until August 2020. The paper concludes with the presentation and examination of three selected case forecasts for Egypt, Cameroon, and Mozambique. El art\u00edculo examina el potencial de las t\u00e9cnicas de aprendizaje de conjuntos multimodelos para la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos y aplica un marco de promedio de conjuntos a la tarea de predicci\u00f3n del concurso de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos armados; ViEWS 2020. La meta es predecir los cambios en la intensidad de los conflictos en cincuenta y cuatro pa\u00edses africanos durante seis meses en el futuro. El conjunto presentado combina seis modelos individuales, que utilizan dos algoritmos de aprendizaje basados en \u00e1rboles, y que incorporan dos bases de datos distintas y dos selecciones geogr\u00e1ficas en un marco de previsi\u00f3n unificado. En uno de los dos conjuntos de datos aplicados, se implementa la combinaci\u00f3n de variables de conflicto de los \u00faltimos meses para estudiar las conexiones intertemporales de los niveles de conflicto anteriores. El segundo conjunto de datos contiene informaci\u00f3n estructural, econ\u00f3mica, pol\u00edtica y social importante para cada caso individual. Ambos conjuntos de datos se utilizan para predecir los cambios en los niveles de conflicto. La estructura del marco y el m\u00e9todo de combinaci\u00f3n se presentan en detalle, y se eval\u00faa la calidad de los resultados de la predicci\u00f3n para ambos per\u00edodos de prueba entre 2014-2016 y 2016-2019. Se analiza a fondo el efecto de la estructura del conjunto y el funcionamiento de todos los componentes individuales. Se presentan previsiones reales a seis meses, para los pr\u00f3ximos meses de octubre de 2020 a marzo de 2021, generados a partir de los datos disponibles hasta agosto de 2020. El art\u00edculo concluye con la presentaci\u00f3n y el an\u00e1lisis de tres previsiones de casos seleccionados de Egipto, Camer\u00fan y Mozambique.

            "abstract": "\n Spatial interdependencies commonly drive the spread of violence in civil conflict. To address such interdependence, scholars often use spatial lags to model the diffusion of violence, but this requires an explicit operationalization of the connectivity matrices that represent the spread of conflict. Unfortunately, in many cases, there are multiple competing processes that facilitate the spread of violence making it difficult to identify the true data-generating process. We show how a network-driven methodology can allow us to account for the spread of violence, even in the cases where we cannot directly measure the factors that drive diffusion. To do so, we estimate a latent connectivity matrix that captures a variety of possible diffusion patterns. We use this procedure to study intrastate conflict in eight conflict-prone countries and show how our framework enables substantially better predictive performance than canonical spatial-lag measures. We also investigate the circumstances under which canonical spatial lags suffice and those under which a latent network approach is beneficial.",

            "abstract": "This article offers policymakers and researchers pragmatic and sustainable approaches to identify and mitigate conflict threats by looking beyond p-values and plausible instruments. We argue that predicting conflict successfully depends on the choice of algorithms, which, if chosen accurately, can reduce economic and social instabilities caused by post-conflict reconstruction. After collating data with variables linked to conflict, we used a grid level dataset of 5928 observations spanning 48 countries across sub-Saharan Africa to predict civil conflict. The goals of the study were to assess the performance of supervised classification machine learning (ML) algorithms in comparison with logistic model, assess the implication of selecting a specific performance metric on policy initiatives, and evaluate the value of interpretability of the selected model. After comparing class imbalance resampling methods, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to improve out-of-sample prediction for the trained model. The results indicate that if our selected performance metric is recall, gradient tree boosting is the best algorithm; however, if precision or F1 score is the selected metric, then the multilayer perceptron algorithm produces the best model.",

Previous research has focused on the role of geographical, political, and economic determinants, and little attention has been paid to civil conflict dynamics. In this article, I examine how a host country\u2019s support for rebel groups may affect the number of refugees that it accommodates. Countries that support rebels host a higher number of refugees than others, as accommodating refugees can be the continuation of that support and help rebel groups in their armed struggle. By hosting people, countries may offer a sanctuary from which rebels can operate some of their insurgent activities. Rebel groups can exploit these camps for recruitment, training, and benefiting from the main services such as health care. In addition, when rebels operate in host countries, these countries may monitor, impact, or even direct the strategies of insurgent groups. Analysis of refugee flows between 1968 and 2011 suggests that countries which support rebel groups host twice as many refugees as others. Results are robust to various model specifications, two different sources for the main explanatory variable, matching analysis, and additional checks. Findings of this article highlight the importance of conflict dynamics in explaining the variation in refugee flows.",

With respect to civil war, studies teach us to expect conflict where it is feasible. However, although we understand where civil conflict occurs, we do not quite understand when it occurs. Focusing on civil conflict, I argue that time-variant and time-invariant explanations relate to the outcome by means of two distinct causal processes, which has implications for the identification of triggers of rare events. I provide an easily implementable approach to improve rare event estimation that uses matching to leverage constant attributes to estimate the effects of rare predictors. I demonstrate the utility of this procedure by providing an aggregate and disaggregate example of civil conflict onset estimation.",

This article explores the complex linkages between climate variability, agricultural production and conflict onset, by focusing on the spatial distribution of crop production in a cross-country setting. We hypothesize that spatial differences in crop production within countries are a relevant factor in shaping the impact of climate variability on conflict in agriculturally -dependent countries. To test this hypothesis, we rely on high-resolution global gridded data on the local yield of four main crops for the period 1982\u20132015 and aggregate the grid-cell information on crop production to compute an empirical indicator of the spatial concentration of agricultural production within countries. Our results show that the negative impacts of climate variability lead to an increase in the spatial concentration of agricultural production within countries. In turn, the combined effect of climate extremes and crop production concentration increases the predicted probability of conflict onset by up to 14% in agriculturally dependent countries.",

            "title": "Who Wants Peace? Predicting Civilian Preferences in Conflict Negotiations",
            "abstract": "Efforts to end civil wars via negotiations often generate sharp divisions in public opinion. A large, quantitative literature has found evidence for numerous variables serving as potential drivers of public support of and opposition to conflict negotiations. Yet the formation of policy preferences is a complex process, and while many factors might make small contributions to an individual\u2019s conflict termination preferences, we lack a sense of which factors matter most or how to adjudicate among competing explanations. In this article, we leverage a large amount of nationally representative survey data from Colombia (2004\u20132015) and use machine learning tools to systematically explore which variables are the strongest predictors of public support for negotiations with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). We find that certain aspects of conflict exposure, individual values bearing on justice and punishment, and belief in the efficacy of the state are among the strongest predictors of negotiation preferences, while many conventionally important variables in the literature have little predictive power. The results have implications for scholars seeking to understand broad drivers of (dis)satisfaction with negotiations and shed light on the polarising Colombian peace process.",

            "abstract": "Common political economy models point to rationalist motives for engaging in conflict but say little about how income shocks translate into collective violence in some cases but not in others. Grievance models, in contrast, focus on structural origins of shared frustration but offer less insight into when the deprived decide to challenge the status quo. Addressing these lacunae, we develop a theoretical model of civil conflict that predicts income loss to trigger violent mobilization primarily when the shock can be linked to preexisting collective grievances. The conditional argument is supported by results of a comprehensive global statistical analysis of conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Consistent with theory, we find that this relationship is most powerful among recently downgraded groups, especially in the context of agricultural dependence and low local level of development, whereas political downgrading in the absence of adverse economic changes exerts less influence on ethnic conflict risk.",

            "abstract": "The spread of civil war poses serious risks and costs. We argue that conflict environments, which vary across time and space, systematically exacerbate the spread of civil war. As conflict in a state\u2019s neighborhood becomes more spatially proximate and as lingering effects of conflict accumulate over time, that state\u2019s risk of civil war onset increases. To theorize and test this argument, we construct the conflict environment (CE) score, a concept that taps into spatial and temporal dimensions of violence in a state\u2019s neighborhood. Using the CE score in established empirical models of civil war onset, we demonstrate that a dangerous conflict environment consistently elevates the risk of civil war, outperforming traditional measures of nearby violence, even when domestic factors are taken into account.",

            "abstract": "How does diffusion of civil war battles influence conflict termination? Recent advances in civil war literature have found that battle dynamics shape conflict termination by affecting the intra-conflict bargaining between disputants. This article extends the theoretical perspective and argues that how battles diffuse matters in determining conflict termination. While battlefield dynamics should in principle reveal previously unavailable private information, the relevance of information-revealing effect depends on the diffusion patterns of battles. The persistent, and possibly battle-exacerbated, commitment problem can also alter the prospects of conflict termination. We test the argument by distinguishing two distinct diffusion patterns of battles: distant and proximate. The empirical results reveal that distant diffusion, but not proximate diffusion, of battles makes civil conflicts less likely to terminate. The analysis also demonstrates that incorporating diffusion dynamics significantly improves our ability to predict conflict termination.",

            "abstract": "We theorize that three distinct structures of democratic constraint explain why more democratic dyads do not engage in military conflict with each other. We build on earlier theories that focused on electoral and horizontal accountability. We add a new dimension\u2014the social accountability provided by an active civil society. Using several new measures from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data set, we stringently test these explanations. We find social accountability to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of nonbelligerence in dyads, that horizontal accountability is still important, but that the independent role of electoral accountability has been somewhat overstated. However, we do find that social and electoral accountability work strongly together, to make for an even greater effect. The finding is robust to a range of specifications and in the face of controls for contending theories that challenge the democratic peace (e.g., the capitalist and territorial peace theories).",

It revisits the greed versus grievance debate to consider the specific regional context and changing nature of conflict in Africa. This is a literature that has grown rapidly in economics and political science, but some recent developments in modeling and conceptualization are providing important new contributions. The article uses the zero-inflated ordered probit technique that deals with the problem of excess zeros in datasets, revisits the definition of conflict, and improves upon some proxy measures. It also considers the substantive as well as statistical significance of the variables. Changes in the technique used provide more support for the influence of grievance terms than given credit for with the usual probit model approach. Both greed and grievance determine conflict in Africa.",

Harnessing novel approaches to data acquisition and analysis, this paper uses insights from an electronic survey with 1,414 respondents to test three prominent theories of why individuals promote conflict with out-groups. The results show that security concerns for the future are strong predictors for a hostile stance and approval of violence. Experiences of violence in the past do not seem to systematically perpetuate hostility. Personal experiences with out-groups strongly correlate with hostile sentiments. These results hold across model specifications, post-stratified estimation based on census data, and a benchmark relying on Finite Mixture Models.",

            "abstract": "This study exploits a sudden and abrupt decline in precipitation of the long rains season in the Horn of Africa to analyze the possible link between climate change and violent armed conflict. Following the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o there has been an overall reduction in precipitation levels \u2013 associated with sea-surface temperature changes in the Indian and Pacific Oceans \u2013 resulting in an increase in the number and severity of droughts. Given that the probable cause of this shift is anthropogenic forcing, it provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of climate change on society compared to statistical inference based on weather variation. Focusing on communal conflict in Ethiopia and Kenya between 1999 and 2014, exploiting cross-sectional variation across districts, the regression analysis links the precipitation decline to an additional 1.3 conflict events per district. The main estimates show that there is a negative correlation between precipitation and communal conflict with a probability of 0.90. Changing model specification to consider plausible alternative models and accommodate other identifying assumptions produces broadly similar results. The generaliziability of the link between precipitation decline and conflict breaks down when using out-of-sample cross-validation to test the external validity. A leave-one-out cross-validation exercise shows that accounting for climate contributes relatively little to improving the predictive performance of the model. This suggests that there are other more salient factors underlying communal violence in Ethiopia and Kenya. As such, in this case the link between climate and conflict should not be overstated.",

            "abstract": "Several studies show a beneficial effect of peacekeeping operations (PKOs). However, by looking at individual effect pathways (intensity, duration, recurrence, diffusion) in isolation, they underestimate the peacekeeping impact of PKOs. We propose a novel method of evaluating the combined impact across all pathways based on a statistical model of the efficacy of UN PKOs in preventing the onset, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of internal armed conflict. We run a set of simulations based on the statistical estimates to assess the impact of alternative UN policies for the 2001\u201313 period. If the UN had invested US$200 billion in PKOs with strong mandates, major armed conflict would have been reduced by up to two-thirds relative to a scenario without PKOs and 150,000 lives would have been saved over the 13-year period compared to a no-PKO scenario. UN peacekeeping is clearly a cost-effective way of increasing global security.",

            "abstract": "This study reviews the contribution in predictive accuracy of a number of geographic and socio-economic factors that are commonly linked to conflict incidence. A logit model is fitted to sub-national data for Africa at grid-cell level covering the years 2000-2009, generating an out-of-sample forecast for the period 2010-2015. Results show that the strongest predictor of future conflict is current conflict incidence in the grid-cell and neighbouring cells. Additionally, the infant mortality rate, which serves as a proxy for socio-economic well-being, shows some prowess in contributing to accurate predictions. This in contrast with factors such as the share of mountainous terrain. Travel time to the nearest city, to proxy for urban-rural differences, is also a strong predictor, but it must be noted that this could be the result of reporting bias in the outcome variable. In general the results highlight that it is difficult to improve accuracy beyond the contribution of conflict dynamics. Finally, the presented results are based on a relatively simple regression model commonly used in the literature and more sophisticated statistical techniques such as machine learning could improve predictions.",

            "abstract": "Forecasts of conflict are of utmost importance for assisting combatant commanders in developing strategic and operational campaign and country plans that consider the dynamic changes that evolve within their area of responsibility. This research formulates and constructs five suites of statistical models to better understand the collinearity of environmental factors affecting conflict and compares the classification accuracy between forcing these factors into logistic regression models. A total of thirtynine predictor variables are tested and evaluated for inclusion in a six region, two conflict state combination suite. The five suites of twelve models calculate the probability of whether a country will transition to either an \u201cIn Conflict\u201d or \u201cNot In Conflict\u201d state for the following year. Handpicking the best models proposed in this study from each suite achieves modeling classification accuracies of 92.0% with 82.6% prediction accuracies. Through exploring new variables and selection methods, the models demonstrate that leveraging the collinearity of environmental factors help provide strategic insight in developing Department of Defense Theater Campaign Plans to effect the stability of national security.",

            "title": "Evaluating the scope and intensity of the conflict trap",
            "abstract": "Several studies show that internal armed conflict breeds conflict by exacerbating conditions that increase the chances of war breaking out again. Empirically, this \u2018conflict trap\u2019 works through four pathways: conflicts increase the likelihood of continuation, recurrence, escalation, and diffusion of conflict. Past empirical studies have underestimated the scope and intensity of the conflict trap since they consider the impact of conflict only through one of these pathways and rarely across sufficiently long time periods. This article shows that simulation and forecasting techniques are useful and indeed necessary to quantify the total, aggregated effect of the conflict trap, over long time periods and across countries. We develop a country-year statistical model that allows estimating the probability of no conflict, minor conflict, and major conflict, and the probabilities of transition between these states. A set of variables denoting the immediate and more distant conflict history of the country are used as endogenous predictors in the simulated forecasts. Another set of variables shown to be robustly associated with armed conflict are treated as exogenous predictors. We show that the conflict trap is even more severe than earlier studies have indicated. For instance, if a large low-income country with no previous conflicts is simulated to have two to three years of conflict over the 2015\u201318 period, we find that it will have nine more years of conflict over the 2019\u201340 period than if peace holds up to 2018. Conversely, if a large low-income country that has had major conflict with more than 1,000 battle-related deaths in several of the past ten years succeeds in containing violence to minor conflict over the 2015\u201318 period, we find that it will experience five fewer years of conflict in the subsequent 20 years than if violence continues unabated.",

Africa is recognized as a particularly vulnerable continent to environmental and climate change since a large portion of its population is poor and reliant on rain-fed agriculture. We use a climate-sensitive approach to model sub-Saharan African violence in the past (geolocated to the nearest settlements) and then forecast future violence using sociopolitical factors such as population size and political rights (governance), coupled with temperature anomalies. Our baseline model is calibrated using 1\u00b0 gridded monthly data from 1980 to 2012 at a finer spatio-temporal resolution than existing conflict forecasts. We present multiple forecasts of violence under alternative climate change scenarios (optimistic and current global trajectories), of political rights scenarios (improvement and decline), and population projections (low and high fertility). We evaluate alternate shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) by plotting violence forecasts over time and by detailed mapping of recent and future levels of violence by decade. The forecasts indicate that a growing population and rising temperatures will lead to higher levels of violence in sub-Saharan Africa if political rights do not improve. If political rights continue to improve at the same rate as observed over the last three decades, there is reason for optimism that overall levels of violence will hold steady or even decline in Africa, in spite of projected population increases and rising temperatures.",

Recently, however, forecasts of political phenomena have received growing attention. Predictions of violent events, in particular, have been increasingly accurate using various methods ranging from expert knowledge to quantitative methods and formal modeling. Yet, we know little about the limits of these approaches, even though information about these limits has critical implications for both future research and policy-making. In particular, are our predictive inaccuracies due to limitations of our models, data, or assumptions, in which case improvements should occur incrementally. Or are there aspects of conflicts that will always remain fundamentally unpredictable? After reviewing some of the current approaches to forecasting conflict, I suggest avenues of research that could disentangle the causes of our current predictive failures.",

The authors hypothesize that the adoption of multiple forms of power sharing, measures constructed to end particularly difficult civil wars, facilitate the emergence of a minimalist form of democracy following some intrastate conflicts by helping to assuage warring groups\u2019 security concerns. The authors use a bivariate probit model to account for the possibility that the decisions by wartime rivals to engage in power sharing and whether to adopt democracy or not are interrelated. Employing panel data for all civils wars concluded between 1945 and the end of 2006, they find support for their hypothesis.",

We then use recently published data on institutional quality and natural resource rents to measure the potential impact of the resource curse on violent civil conflicts using a panel of data for over 100 countries in the period 1970\u20132010. Our model explicitly accounts for the role of good economic and political institutions in deterring the recourse to violence as well as the extent to which they might weaken the resource rents effect.",

As IDA is distributed only to countries that fall below an (ad hoc) income threshold, we employ a (fuzzy) regression discontinuity approach to estimate the causal effect of IDA on conflict. Our results suggest that IDA leads to a decrease in minor conflict events, such as anti-government demonstrations and riots and in an increase in major conflict events like assassinations of political leaders and revolutions. Moreover, IDA is associated with an increase in coup attempts and autocratic regime transitions. These results suggest that foreign aid may \u201cwin the hearts and minds of the population\u201d, by increasing popular support for the government, and at the same time increase conflict over lootable aid rents.",

            "abstract": "\n Quantitative research into the causes of violent intrastate conflicts has recently shifted away from classical country-year-level regression analyses. When taking steps in new directions, researchers should be mindful of the extent and quality, and indeed of the limitations, of the knowledge accumulated by the scholarly endeavors in the booming period between 2000 and 2015. This article traces trends and patterns regarding the use of explanatory variables and datasets in ninety-four individual studies. It synthesizes findings with regard to 107 explanatory concepts. Drawing on the sign test, the analysis identifies a set of consensus variables likely to determine the onset and incidence of violent intrastate conflict. These factors capture robust covariations and lend themselves as elements of a \u201cstandard model specification.\u201d Turning to causal mechanisms, the article discusses why variables that turn out to be significant in statistical analyses should have any effect. This is completed by a substantial discussion of the remaining theoretical problems and of methodological prospects that promise paths for future research.",

These processes are often dynamic, changing over time and space. In this study, we embrace these complexities through a network-based approach. By considering important relational patterns, such as reciprocity and transitivity, and tying them together with existing theoretical developments in the conflict processes literature, we answer the question of \u201cwho fights whom and when\u201d during civil conflict. Furthermore, by using the case of Nigeria, we offer novel theoretical insights about how the entrance of a new, aggressive actor can decisively alter the trajectory of conflict. In addition, we show that our approach is better at predicting \u201cwho fights whom and when\u201d in an out-of-sample context than extant approaches.",

Understanding the reasons that push group members to adopt a certain level of conflict intensity is of the utmost importance. In the hope of shedding new light into this phenomenon, this paper explores how ethnic conflict intensity may be influenced by linguistic vitality, the social health of a language. The paper presents a theoretical model in which low and high levels of linguistic vitality are presented as being linked to lower conflict intensity than moderate vitality levels. The results of multilevel modeling lend support to this hypothesis for language-based ethnic tensions in a general context and, more precisely, within countries.",

            "abstract": "Many scholars have detected a decrease of political violence, but the causes of this decline remain unclear. As a contribution to this debate, we revisit the controversy over trends in conflict after the end of the Cold War. While many made ominous predictions of surging ethnic warfare, Gurr presented evidence of a pacifying trend since the mid-1990s and predicted a further decline in ethnic conflict in an article on \u2018the waning of ethnic war\u2019. Leveraging more recent data on ethnic groups and their participation in ethnic civil wars, this study evaluates if Gurr was right about the decline of ethnic conflict, and if he was right for the right reasons. We assess whether an increase in governments\u2019 accommodative policies toward ethnic groups can plausibly account for a decline in ethnic civil war. Our findings lend considerable support to an account of the pacifying trend that stresses the granting of group rights, regional autonomy, and inclusion in power-sharing, as well as democratization and peacekeeping.",

            "abstract": "India\u2019s rapid economic growth over the last decade has been coupled with a Maoist insurgency that competes for the allegiances of rural populations with the state. In response to the threat, the Government of India has securitized development, using public works programs in an attempt to sway locals away from Maoist allegiance. However, these areas are also home to massive iron, coal, and steel factories that drive India\u2019s growth. This study uniquely aimed to address the lack of local-level analysis and the lack of a robust dataset by merging previous qualitative fieldwork with disparate conflict data sources at the district level to explore different potential explanatory variables for the Maoist insurgency, including the relationship between development works, violence, and natural resource extraction. We find that while effective implementation of development programs like NREGA may indeed be loosely related to the suppression of violent activities in districts affected by the Maoist conflict, it is the presence of significant mining activity that is the best predictor of violence.",

            "abstract": "Despite considerable interest in the relationship between Islam and political violence, there is little systematic empirical research that explores the intrastate conflict proneness of Muslim countries, and existing studies provide mixed results. This article examines the causal factors that explain the prevalence of intrastate conflict in Muslim-plurality states and the conditions under which Islam may influence civil war onset. Further, following Ward, Greenhill, and Bakke\u2019s (2010) suggestion, the effects of Islam and other socioeconomic and political factors in actually predicting civil wars are examined by utilizing ROC curves and cross-validation exercises. Utilizing the Uppsala Conflict Data Program\u2019s data for the 1981\u20132009 period, the findings indicate that Muslim-plurality countries are indeed disproportionately involved in intrastate conflicts, but these countries are also characterized by lower GDP per capita, oil dependency, state repression, autocracy, and youth bulges, all of which correlate strongly with intrastate conflict onset. The significance of Islam disappears when controls for such factors are included in the statistical model. The variable of Islam does not make any significant contribution to either the in-sample or out-of-sample predictive power of models. Among the factors that increase the risk of intrastate conflict, the presence of a youth bulge has the greatest impact in Muslim-plurality countries.",

We argue that common indicators used in previous research, such as the ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF) and the Gini coefficient for income dispersion, fail to capture fundamental aspects of political exclusion and economic inequality that can motivate conflict. Drawing on insights from group-level research, we develop new country-level indices that directly reflect inequalities among ethnic groups, including political discrimination and wealth differentials along ethnic lines. Our analysis reveals that these theoretically informed country profiles are much better predictors of civil war onset than conventional inequality indicators, even when we control for a number of alternative factors potentially related to grievances or opportunities for conflict.",

            "abstract": "Civil wars reflect, in part, internal contestation over the provision of resources. A government\u2019s ability to \u201cbuy off\u201d rebellion by providing social welfare payments is one mechanism to help ensure social stability. In times of economic distress, however, the government becomes increasingly constrained in its ability to provide social welfare and, absent some form of financial relief, will be subject to increasing pressure from potential rebel groups. Migrant remittances can serve as a smoothing mechanism that provides for social welfare needs outside the formal mechanisms of the state, and therefore acts to reduce the incentive for rebellion. We develop a model of migrant remittances as a vehicle that provides domestic stability in times of economic constraints. We test hypotheses from this model on World Bank remittance data to 152 countries from 1980 to 2005. Our results suggest that a significant increase in migrant remittances during crises can lower the risk of civil war.",

            "abstract": "To fully understand the effects of factors that encourage rebellion, we must differentiate between the way such factors influence mass decisions to join an ongoing rebellion and the way they influence the level of concessions offered by the government. We analyze a three-player bargaining model that allows us to do so. Our results indicate that governments tolerate a greater risk of conflict with their chosen concessions when any conflict that does occur is likely to take the form of a limited, rather than popular, rebellion. We demonstrate that rebellions are more likely to be popular when the general populace is relatively dissatisfied with the status quo and when the government is relatively incapable of putting down rebellions. Widespread poverty and low state capacity might therefore be associated with a lower likelihood of conflict, but a greater probability that the general populace will participate in any conflict that does occur.",

            "title": "The political ecology and economy of protected areas and violence : a case study of the conflict of the Kivus in the Democratic Republic of Congo",
            "abstract": "The role that national parks play in violent conflict has rarely been discussed. Conflict literature focuses on the interaction of specific natural resources on the \ninitiation and perpetuation of war and debate has emphasised the degree to which resource scarcity and abundance are pertinent. The role of space, particularly environmentally-significant areas, in shaping these trajectories has been subject to limited interrogation. Drawing from political economy literature, the dissertation explores the relationship between occupation of these spaces by armed groups and the desire to acquire financial and material resources. Furthermore, by situating the study sites within their historical and \npolitical context, the dissertation also investigates linkages to political ecology models which seek to explain how environmental changes shape wider political \nand economic processes and how they in turn shape environmental change. \nThis work undertakes a case study approach, focussing on two national parks in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo that have been subject since the 1990s to the world\u2019s deadliest conflict in the post-World War II era. By mapping conflict related health data in proximity to the case study sites, comparisons between the two sites were possible due to similar geographic attributes \n(namely protected area status) and political context. Positive linkages between levels of violence as a result of the armed conflict were established across both sites. Higher levels of violence in proximity to the national park that lacked valuable conflict-related resources point to the relative importance of location versus the economic benefit of occupying these spaces. This is substantiated by qualitative analysis across the two sites and a household survey around one. Therefore, it is concluded that national parks influence violence by virtue of their status as state-owned entities; by their possession of valuable resources; and by the strategic value of their location. Hence, it may be argued that the \nrole of environmentally-significant spaces in armed conflict is worthy of further empirical analysis in studies of political ecology.",

This paper tests this popular assumption with a model drawn from Azar's Theory of Protracted Social Conflict and a fixed effects logistic regression and finds that food availability has no significant effect on the probability of violent civil conflict onset. However, other factors such as a country's level of integration into the international system of states and economic growth are likely to be more effective at maintaining global stability. The policy implications are that efforts to promote peace can be more effective by focusing on integration into the world community and economic growth than by focusing exclusively on food availability.",

Our model predicts more political violence when governments violate the physical integrity rights of their citizens\u2014especially when they frequently imprison citizens for political reasons or make them \u201cdisappear\u201d. These coercive techniques may create more citizen dissatisfaction than other types of violations of physical integrity rights, because citizens perceive political imprisonment and disappearances as the direct result of the deliberate policy choices of politicians. Our model also forecasts more political violence in weak states and states that allow dissatisfied citizens to coordinate their anti-government activities. Specifically, we demonstrate that political violence tends to be higher if governments respect their citizens\u2019 right to freedom of assembly and association and offer widespread use of mobile phone and internet technology.",

This article shows how a market-capitalist economy\u2014one where most citizens normally obtain their livelihoods contracting in the market\u2014creates citizen-wide preferences for universal freedom, peace, and the democratic rule of law. Prior research has corroborated the theory's predictions linking market-capitalism with liberal preferences, human rights, and peace among nations. Here, Granger tests of causality show that market-capitalism causes higher income, but higher income does not cause market-capitalism, and from 1961 to 2001 not a single civil war, insurgency, or rebellion occurred in any nation with a market-capitalist economy. Market-capitalism is the strongest variable in the civil conflict literature, and many of the most robust relationships in this literature are spurious\u2014including income, state capacity, and oil-export dependency.",

            "abstract": "India\u2019s rapid economic growth over the last decade has been coupled with a Maoist insurgency that competes with the state for rural allegiance. In response to the threat, the Government of India has securitized development, using public works programmes in an attempt to sway locals away from Maoist allegiance. However, these areas are also home to massive iron and coal mines that drive India\u2019s growth. This study aims to address the lack of local-level analysis and the lack of a robust dataset by merging qualitative fieldwork with disparate district-level conflict data sources to explore different potential explanatory variables for the Maoist insurgency, including the relationship between development works, violence, and natural resource extraction. We find that while effective implementation of development programmes is loosely related to the immediate suppression of violent activities in Maoist-affected districts, and under certain conditions mining activity increases the likelihood for conflict, it is the presence of scheduled caste and tribal communities that is the best predictor of violence.",

            "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, the large-N civil war research program has been a vibrant one but has reached an analytical plateau because methodological issues have obscured fundamental conceptual and theoretical concerns. The existing ground-clearing work has shed light on macro- and micro-level determinants of internal conflict onset, duration, and termination, but has left the field theoretically impoverished. This article discusses remaining gaps in the quantitative civil war literature, and proposes conceptual, theoretical, and methodological remedies. Five main lacunae are identified. First, civil war may be a longer process, with several waves of escalation and de-escalation, than generally described in the extant literature. Second, existing theories conflate civil conflict with violence\u2014war onset and violence may be conceptually distinct. Third, we have few systemic-level theories of civil war onset and duration. Fourth, we need better theories that allow us to determine whether civil wars are different from other types of wars. Finally, we need to go beyond state-centric monadic approaches, and be more rigorous when building our models for explaining civil war onset, duration, or termination.",

            "abstract": "The hypothesis that democratization triggers political violence has been proposed repeatedly in the quantitative literature, but it remains controversial with respect to both interstate and civil wars. Current empirical research continues to be afflicted by methodological and data problems related to the measurement of democracy and the task of detecting changes in such scores. In order to gain further clarity into the link between democratization and civil war, the current study introduces a new period-finding algorithm that is able to detect periods of democratization and autocratization. This allows for a more flexible way of finding directional changes in governance indicators than is possible with the rigid lag structures commonly employed in previous studies. When regressed on various measures of civil-war onset, the indicator for the initiation of a period of democratization has a strong and robust effect on conflict even in the presence of static measures of regime type. The same applies to autocratization, but its impact is much more sudden than that of democratization. Moreover, we find that the democratization effect is limited to governmental rather than territorial conflicts. Further research will be needed to confirm these results in terms of the relevant causal mechanisms, especially in ethno-nationalist civil wars.",

The model is based on utility theory, rebels will conduct a civil war if the perceived benefits outweigh the costs of rebellion. Using probit and tobit models, the propositions are tested empirically. Four variables, initial income, ethno-linguistic fractionalization, the amount of natural resources, and initial population size are significant and strong determinants of the duration and the probability of civil wars. One important finding is that the relationship between civil wars and ethnic diversity is nonmonotonic; highly fractionalized societies have no greater risk of experiencing a civil war than homogenous ones.

In contrast, the few quantitative analyses that explore this issue focus on several mechanisms, make conflicting claims, and provide mixed results, thereby suggesting that CCPs do not have general effects. Yet the quantitative findings might be inaccurate for several reasons: Some use the identity of the colonizer as a proxy for CCPs, others measure a CCP but have small samples with limited variation in the focal independent variable, and all of these analyses are unable to explore whether CCPs affect ethnic conflict through different and competing mechanisms. To address these limitations, we create four ideal types of CCPs, gather data on a CCP that conforms to each ideal type, and test the relationships between CCPs and ethnic civil warfare onset using the set of former British and French colonies. We find that a discriminatory CCP is associated with high odds of ethnic civil war onset, especially shortly after independence. Alternatively, differentiating and accommodating CCPs lack general relationships with ethnic civil war onset, and an empowering CCP is negatively related to ethnic warfare in most models.",

            "abstract": "\n Using data on 172 countries from 1946 until 2014, this paper examines how time-wise variations in temperature at the country level interacted with cross-country variations in agricultural potential impact the incidence of civil conflicts. In the analysis, countries exhibiting high agricultural potential act as a control group for countries with a lower agricultural potential and variations in temperature act as a treatment from one period to the next. This allows identifying the causal impact of the interaction on conflict incidence. We find that deviations in annual or decennial temperature are conducive to a higher probability of being in conflict in countries with lower agricultural potential. The findings have important policy implications to predict, avoid or mitigate conflicts related to climate change.",

The study also investigated the factors of armed conflict and Governance on Economic development. Both qualitative and quantitative Statistical approaches were employed as well as a cross-sectional, descriptive and inferential statistical method of analysis. The study sample size was 348 people selected from Central Equatoria by use of Probability sampling methods. The sample size was determined by using Krejcie and Morgan Table (1970) formula and the data analysis was made using the Statistical Package for Social sciences (SPSS version 18). The major findings of the study were that: there was a positive relationship between armed conflict and socio-economic development (r = 0.691, P-value < 0.01) which implied that armed conflict affects socio-economic development of Central Equatoria, such that, if there was an armed conflict in Central Equatoria , then the economic development of Central Equatoria slows down ; the study also revealed a positive significant relationship between governance and socio-economic development (r = 0.446, P-value < 0.01) which implies that the socio-economic development of Central Equatoria is influenced by the governance. Furthermore, it showed (R= 0.752) a combination of armed conflict and Governance in assessing the level to which they can predict the level of Social economic development in Central Equatoria, such that a one unit change in armed conflict would contribute to a change in Socio-economic development of Central Equatoria by (.752) while a one unit change in governance would contribute to a change in social economic development of Central Equatoria by (.508).It further indicated a statistically significant difference between the number of dependents of the respondents and how likely armed conflict would influence socio-economic development values inCentral Equatoria(0.530). Lastly, it indicated a statistically significant difference between gender distribution and how likely armed conflict would influence Socio-economic development in Juba (0.64; Central Equatoria1). The study concluded that, change in armed conflict would contribute to a change in social economic development of Central Equatoria and that governance would influence socio-economic development in Central Equatoriaas evidenced by the result point (0.718)]. The study also observed that, thereis no peacetargeting approach enlisting peace building measures in the former Central Equatoria State (Yei, Lanya, Kajokeji, Morobo, Terekeka, etc.) that should directly focus on how to combat armed conflict especially the fighters. Consequently, a proper recommendable approach that would be fostering Amnesty programs for fighters, to encourage withdrawal from rebel groups and all guerilla camps, and what government should do so as to realize Peace and Development in South Sudan, was discussed in depth and recommendations are provided in this study.",

            "abstract": "The recent attention of peace studies scholars to the role of the \"public\" parallels an increased interest of democratic theorists in the legitimacy of \"mini-publics:\" initiatives that bring small groups of citizens together to discuss policy issues. In fact, democratic activists and peace activists who seek to engage the public face similar theoretical and practical challenges. The purpose of this article is to contribute to an emerging dialogue between the disciplines of democratic theory and peace studies. Such a dialogue can be beneficial in at least two ways: it allows an exploration of the role of legitimacy in public peace processes and the burdens that legitimacy put on the institutional design of such processes, and it allows an exploration of more ambitious models of public participation in the peace process. Introduction Traditionally, peace studies understood peacemaking as the realm of diplomats. This is no longer the case. Many scholars of peace studies believe that peace must be made by publics, not politicians. Sustainable peace requires a \"public peace process:\u201d \u201csustained action by citizens outside governments to change the fundamental relationship between groups in conflict\u201d (Chufrin and Saunders 1993, 155-6). Indeed, Gawerc (2006, 440) notes that in recent years peace studies scholarship \u201chave given voice to the critical role that private citizens, local The \u201cPublic\u201d in \"Public Peace Process\" and in \"Mini-Publics\" Peace and Conflict Studies \u2022 Volume 17, Number 2 348 initiatives, and people-to-people activities have in building peace, as well as in maintaining conflict.\u201d Practically, peace scholars and activists who embrace the notion of a \u201cpublic peace process\u201d focus on grassroots initiatives that try to create ongoing productive dialogue among groups of citizens within and across the belligerent sides. These initiatives operate at two levels. At one level, they seek to modify the views of the participants themselves. At the same time, the hope and expectation is that this change of minds will trickle wide and up, so to speak, and lead to a similar change of minds in the public at large and among policy makers. The recent theoretical and practical interest of peace studies scholars in the role of the public parallels similar trends in democratic theory. Scholars and practitioners of participatory and deliberative democracy are exploring the idea of \"mini-publics:\" initiatives that bring small groups of citizens together to discuss policy issues (Fung 2003; Goodin and Dryzek 2006). There are obvious similarities between initiatives of \"public peace process\" and \"mini-publics.\" Both try to generate a small-scale model, a microcosm, of a process that has to take place in society at large. The underlying belief of both is that citizens can change their minds when they encounter different perspectives, and that they need to have the opportunity to do so for the desired social change to be possible. Furthermore, both kinds of initiatives also face similar difficulties. They are mostly local initiatives and typically with limited budgets (Ross and Rothman, 1999, 9, describe them as \u201cbootstrap operations;\u201d see also Dajani and Baskin, 2006, 75, 107-8). They often take place in hostile environments which question the very legitimacy of the initiative, and the attention that these initiatives receive from politicians and the media is mostly scarce and fickle. The \u201cPublic\u201d in \"Public Peace Process\" and in \"Mini-Publics\" Peace and Conflict Studies \u2022 Volume 17, Number 2 349 Given these theoretical and practical similarities, it is surprising that there is very little dialogue between democratic theory and peace studies. One reason for the lack of dialogue is probably the different orientations of the two fields: the theoretical orientation of democratic theory vs. the practical orientation of peace studies. Yet, these orientations too are changing. Democratic theorists are increasingly interested in on-the-ground experiments in democracy, and peace studies scholars are engaging in theoretically sophisticated reflections about their practices. Within this fertile ground, a dialogue between peace studies and democratic theory begins to emerge, and the purpose of this paper is to contribute to this dialogue by examining the relevance of works done in democratic theory to the theory underlying public peace process initiatives. I argue that a conversation between the two research-action areas can be beneficial in at least two ways. First, generally speaking, peace studies understand the role of public participation in conflict resolution through the framework of social-psychology (for example Azar and Burton 1986; Kelman 1997). Public participation is a way to shift the discussion from the political dimension to the level of inter-personal relationships (Kelman 1999). In contrast, within democratic theory public participation is understood as a pre-condition for achieving legitimacy. Even if officials can reach a stable agreement, the only way to know whether this agreement is legitimate is through a process of reflective scrutiny by those who will be affected by the terms of the agreement. A dialogue between democratic theory and peace studies allows an exploration of the role of legitimacy in public peace process. This is not merely a theoretical or philosophical question. The claim for legitimacy depends on aspects of institutional design of the public peace process. To be sure, practitioners in both camps generally engage in an uphill The \u201cPublic\u201d in \"Public Peace Process\" and in \"Mini-Publics\" Peace and Conflict Studies \u2022 Volume 17, Number 2 350 battle in which institutional design is dictated more by the limited perseverance of funding agencies and participants than by what is required for gaining legitimacy. Nevertheless, democratic theorists take more liberty to imagine ideal conditions of more control over design and therefore engage in a comparative analysis of the legitimacy of different models of institutional design. Their conclusions speak directly to similar issues in public peace processes. The second benefit of such a conversation is that it allows an exploration of more ambitious models of public participation in the peace process. In particular, I refer to the model of Citizens\u2019 Assemblies on Electoral Reform that took place in British Columbia (2004) and Ontario (2008). In these cases, the provincial government assembled a group of citizens who were selected randomly and asked them to study electoral systems and recommend electoral reforms to the province if they find that reforms are needed. What was unique in these cases was not just that the government invested comparatively vast resources in the process, and the length and depth of the deliberative process itself, but also the fact that the government committed itself to submit the recommendations of the assembly to a referendum (Lang 2007; Warren and Pearse 2008). Thus, the government took itself outside of the process of decision-making and allowed a deliberative body of a small group of citizens to make recommendations to the public at large. I believe that this model serves as a precedent for citizens\u2019 involvement in policy making that should excite the imagination of scholars of peace studies (the limited success of the assemblies in the referenda and then many differences between electoral reforms and peace agreements notwithstanding). Peace scholars can and should build upon this precedent and study the viability of more ambitious models of public involvement in the peace process. The \u201cPublic\u201d in \"Public Peace Process\" and in \"Mini-Publics\" Peace and Conflict Studies \u2022 Volume 17, Number 2 351 The scope of the discussion is therefore limited to the questions that emerge from a dialogue between these two kinds of practical initiatives and the academic scholarship about them. It does not purport to offer a comprehensive survey of the relationship between democracy and peace-making. Furthermore, my focus here is on the question of legitimacy. While I believe that both mini-publics and public peace processes are promising and important kinds of social activism, I am in no position to assess within the scope of this article the likely effectiveness of such initiatives in any particular setting. Background The last two decades witnessed a dramatic change in the terrain of democratic theory. While previous generations of democratic theorists understood democracy to be a mechanism for fair aggregation of preferences via the mechanism of voting, the \"deliberative turn\" in democratic theory shifted the scholarly attention to the important role of reasonable debate in democracy. In this latter view, the mere fact that a majority of the citizens favors a policy or a candidate provides only weak grounds for claiming legitimacy for this decision. Democracy can and should make a stronger claim for legitimacy, which is that democratic institutions provide a site for exchange of reasons. Democratic decisions are legitimate not only because they won a plurality or majority of votes but because they are an outcome of public debate. Strong democracy, then, requires a viable public sphere where citizens can freely exchange opinions and debate policies. Furthermore, the strength of democracy depends on the quality of the discussion in the public sphere. Even a viable public sphere would not be legitimate if arguments of certain participants are systematically silenced or marginalized. The public, in this view, is not simply The \u201cPublic\u201d in \"Public Peace Process\" and in \"Mini-Publics\" Peace and Conflict Studies \u2022 Volume 17, Number 2 352 an aggregate of individual opinions but a social sphere where different players demand and give justifications for public policies. However, when viewed through the lenses of deliberative democracy, many established democracies face a deficit, if not a crisis, of democratic legitimacy. Most citizens choose to remain ge",

I use a wide range of variables to define conflict, using data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). In addition, I use agricultural data from the Spatial Production and Allocation Model (SPAM) for the year 2005. Overall, I find that areas that grow rice show lower instances of conflict. This result is even more pronounced for the West African region. The results are consistent with the predictions of the rice theory.",

            "abstract": "This article claims that the role of pre-war grievances as a predictor of violence against civilians in civil wars may have been systematically underestimated because the \u201cgrievance hypothesis\u201d has not been properly tested. Pre-war grievances can only affect civilian victimization in civil wars if they have been intensely mobilized in the period close to the outbreak of the conflict and if there is a temporary collapse of state capacity. This article presents a \u201cfair test\u201d of the grievance hypothesis. It analyses in depth a specific case of a pre-war grievance that met these two conditions. This case is the conflict around land property rights in Catalonia before the Spanish Civil War and its effects on violence against civilians during the war. The results show a non-negligible effect of pre-war grievances on civilian victimization.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The large empirical conflict literature has established that there is a strong negative link between economic variables and the onset of an armed civil conflict. However, it has been difficult to demonstrate a clear causality between poor economic performance and increased risk of conflict because of potential endogeneity issues, especially for large country samples. Most existing studies that analyse the causal links focus on the effects of economic growth on conflict, even though conventional conflict studies find the strongest relationship for income levels. In this article, we use three new exogenous instruments for income per capita, based on historical data for mailing times, telegram charges and urbanization rates. Using instrumental variables methods and global panel data for the period 1946\u20132014, we show that the negative effect of income per capita on the probability of conflict onset is consistently strong and larger than in conventional estimations using pooled ordinary least square regressions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract : Using open source data, this research formulates and constructs a suite of statistical models that predict future transitions into and out of violent conflict and forecasts the regional and global incidences of violent conflict over a ten-year time horizon. A total of thirty predictor variables are tested and evaluated for inclusion in twelve conditional logistic regression models, which calculate the probability that a nation will transition from its current conflict state, either In Conflict or Not in Conflict, to a new state in the following year. These probabilities are then used to construct a series of nation-specific Markov chain models that forecast violent conflict, as well as yield insights into regional conflict trends out to year 2024 and beyond. The logistic regression models proposed in this study achieve training dataset accuracies of 88.76%, and validation dataset accuracies of 84.67%. Additionally, the Markov models achieve three year forecast accuracies of 85.16% during model validation. This study predicts that global violent conflict rates remain constant through year 2024, but are projected to increase beyond that timeframe with 95 of the 182 considered nations projected to be in a state of violent conflict from the current 84 nations in conflict.",

            "abstract": "Third parties intervene in ongoing civil wars frequently and at times with nefarious intentions. In this paper, we consider the possibility that lootable natural resources motivate third parties to intervene in wars on the side of the opposition. Such resources offer a host of benefits to the intervener, including resource extraction and greater likelihood of rebel success. When rebels have access to lootable resources, we hypothesize that third parties will be more likely to intervene on the side of the rebels and simultaneously less likely to intervene on behalf of the government. Rare-events logit and split population (mixture-cure) survival models, in conjunction with close attention to the mechanisms found in individual cases, offer support for the theoretical argument. This paper advances our understanding of the motivations for intervention into civil war by highlighting the largely neglected role of economic factors in motivating opposition-biased interventions. It further adds insights into the role of natural resources in civil wars by shifting emphasis away from domestic combatants towards the motives of outside states.",

            "abstract": "Violent domestic conflicts spread between countries via spillover effects and the desire to emulate events abroad. Herein, we extend this emulation logic to the potential for the contagion of nonviolent conflicts. The spread of predominantly nonviolent pro-democracy mobilizations across the globe in the mid-to-late 1980s, the wave of protests in former Soviet states during the Color revolutions in the 2000s, and the eruption of nonviolent movements across the Middle East and North Africa during the Arab Spring in the early 2010s each suggest that the observation of collective action abroad encourages a desire to emulate among potential challengers to domestic autocrats. However, the need to emulate varies. Potential challengers with a recent history of protest at home are less dependent (than are those without similar experience) upon foreign exemplars to mobilize the participants and generate the resources required to make emulation practicable. By contrast, where the domestic experience of protest is absent, opposition movements are more reliant upon emulation of foreign exemplars. We test the implications of this logic using a series of multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our tests employ data on nonviolent civil resistance mobilizations that occurred across the global population of autocratic states between 1946 and 2006. These tests, along with post-estimation analysis, provide evidence consistent with our conditional logic of emulation.",

Such persistence has in the past been attributed to various causes but it is the contention of this paper that African conflicts fester due to poor governance and thereafter persist and recur because the issues that led to the conflict are not adequately addressed in the course of resolving the conflict. To justify this position, the paper attempts a classification and analysis of what it considers to be recurring patterns in the conflict processes of some post-independence African states and also attempts a classification and analysis of efforts at resolving such them. It argues that the expedient is often promoted over equity in the management of African conflicts and that mediators and facilitators routinely disregard the underlying issues of the conflict in their haste to abstract an agreement from the parties. It posits that some of the compromises that are extracted from the parties fail to meet their basic expectations and thus force them into a temporary peace that is abandoned at the earliest opportunity. The paper concludes that lasting peace is only feasible when issues of justice and equity are given priority of place and the parties are accorded sustained assistance as they embark on national reconciliation.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to explicate a set of specific conditions under which colonization may lead to civil war. The specific set of conditions focus on how colonization affects the economic relations of groups within colonized states in both directions. First of all, the study examines the decision theoretic model for explaining how economic interdependency will decrease the probability of conflict. In doing so, static and dynamic formed games are introduced and the models conclude that the utility of engaging in war when groups which have symmetric endowments are higher. Therefore, when colonization monoculturizes the production of groups, the onset of war has more risk to the groups. In order to illustrate the model, the study focuses on two cases: the Arusha and Meru in Tanganyika and the Hema and Lendu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case of Arusha-Meru people indicates that colonization actually lead the production scheme to diversify and hence, decreases the tension between them. On the other hand, the Hema and Lendu tribes illustrate the impact of monoculturization on the onset of civil conflict.",

Using a worldwide dataset of 7,704 individual ethnic group settlements of 862 ethnic groups in 177 countries, we find that conflicts strongly reduce light output in settlements directly affected by fighting over the period 1992-2008. In addition, conflicts have large negative spillovers both across and within countries: light output in settlements not directly exposed to fighting declines significantly once a conflict begins; neighboring countries also experience large negative effects. The negative effects of conflicts are particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe, but also observable in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South and South-East Asia. In contrast, conflicts have, on average, no negative effects on light output in the Middle East and in the West. We contrast these results with cross-country regressions with GDP data, which suggest much smaller negative effects of conflicts.",

This article presents a critical review of the most widely used indices of democracy in civil war studies, and suggests that the competitiveness of the executive power can be a useful measure for quantitative conflict research. The paper also analyses, by means of statistical regression, the relationship between the competitiveness in the executive recruitment and civil war incidence from 1976 to 2000. The findings indicate that both single-candidate and multi-party elections reduce the incidence of civil war. Furthermore, the results lend support to the hypotheses put forward by recent literature that ethnic fractionalisation, mountainous terrain, large population and centralised political systems significantly heighten the risk of incidence of civil war, while high GDP per capita and economic growth decrease the likelihood of internal conflicts.",

Theory predicts that resource booms or discoveries may attenuate or accentuate the risk of conflict, depending on various factors. Regression analyses also produce mixed signals and point to a plethora of mechanisms linking resources to conflict. The empirical literature is gradually evolving from cross-country conflict models to micro-level analyses, explaining variation in local intensity of conflict. This transition has resulted in more credible identification strategies and in an enhanced understanding of the complex relation between resources and conflict.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Anarchy was coming to Africa, Robert Kaplan warned in 1994, and a surge in conflict initially seemed to confirm that prediction. With less fanfare, however, after the year 2000, conflict in Africa declined, probably to the lowest levels ever. Recent fighting in Libya, Mali, South Sudan and elsewhere has prompted a new wave of \u2018Africa falling apart\u2019 concerns. This article reviews the history and data of conflict in Africa, from pre-colonial times to the present. Historical comparison and quantitative analysis based on the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and Major Episodes of Political Violence (MEPV) datasets on the 1961\u20132013 period show that Africa has experienced a remarkable decline in warfare, whether measured in number of conflicts or fatalities. Warfare is a relatively low risk to the lives of most Africans. The years 2010\u20132013 saw an increase of 35 per cent in African battle deaths over 2005\u20132010, but they still are 87 per cent lower than the 1990\u20131999 average. Changes in external support and intervention, and the spread of global norms regarding armed conflict, have been most decisive in reducing the levels of warfare in the continent. Consequently, there is no Africa exception to the systemic shift towards lower levels of armed conflict.",

            "abstract": "The principles of humanitarian assistance dictate that aid be distributed in accordance with need while remaining neutral with respect to the political stakes. However, these principles have unique implications in the postconflict context, where need is often correlated with opponents' performance in the previous contest. In these cases, humanitarian assistance is likely to be biased towards the conflict loser. Using a crisis-bargaining framework, this article describes a simple logic for how humanitarian aid can inadvertently undermine peace by creating a revisionist party with the incentive to renegotiate the postwar settlement. The empirical expectations of the theory are tested using a panel dataset of cross-national humanitarian aid expenditures in civil conflicts since the end of the Cold War. As the theory predicts, postconflict states treated with higher levels of humanitarian assistance exhibit shorter spells of peace; however, this effect only occurs after conflicts that ended with a decisive victory.",

The results indicate that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between conflict, inflation, poverty, economic growth and unemployment. There is evidence in support of a direct relationship between conflicts and Nigeria's economic growth, in that the incidents of violent conflicts are partly due to the drive for control of national wealth. It was found that macroeconomic instability, poverty and unemployment are significant variables influencing the nature and dynamics of conflicts in the country, suggesting that the nature of growth experienced is not one that is conflicting-reducing. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ plots indicate parameter constancy in the estimated model .

We argue that segregation can increase the collective articulation within groups and the difference between preferences, which can increase conflict intensity. Our focus is on ethnic segregation because we follow the idea that although conflicts can be economically motivated, they need other aspects to find their expression, such as religion, language or ethnicity. Using a panel data model, we find robust evidence on the relationship between segregation and social conflict even after controlling for polarization and fractionalization.",

            "abstract": "Oil and natural gas are highly valuable natural resources, but many countries with large untapped reserves suffer from poor economic and social-welfare performance. This conundrum is known as the resource curse. The resource curse is a result of poor governance and wealth distribution structures that allow the elite to monopolize resources for self-gain. When rival social groups compete for natural resources, civil unrest soon follows. While conceptually easy to follow, there have been few formal attempts to study this phenomenon. Thus, we develop a mathematical model that captures the basic elements and dynamics of this dilemma. We show that when resources are monopolized by the elite, increased exportation leads to decreased domestic production. This is due to under-provision of the resource-embedded energy and industrial infrastructure. Decreased domestic production then lowers the marginal return on productive activities, and insurgency emerges. The resultant conflict further displaces human, built, and natural capital. It forces the economy into a vicious downward spiral. Our numerical results highlight the importance of governance reform and productivity growth in reducing oil-and-gas-related conflicts, and thus identify potential points of intervention to break the downward spiral.",

We argue that the rarity of state failure, along with classification tree\u2019s simplicity of use and interpretation makes this approach more attractive than existing methods. Our dataset includes a comprehensive list of the correlates of conflict variables according to the current literature. We identify an objective and measurable hierarchy of a subset of these variables as necessary for predicting state failure. Further, our methodology suggests that different types of states can have very different reasons for failing, reasons that straightforward regression techniques, with their focus on marginal analysis, simply cannot identify. There are different pathways to state failure. In fact, our approach rank orders the likelihood that a particular pathway will lead to state failure. Last, we suggest that our methodology is more accurate than current attempts at predicting state failure. There are many roads into the abyss. We provide a road map.",

This study uses new coded data on 227 communal groups throughout the world to assess a general model of how and why they mobilize to defend and promote their collective interests. Statistical analysis shows that cultural identity, inequalities, and historical loss of autonomy all contribute substantially to their grievances. Political mobilization, grievances, and the international diffusion and contagion of communal conflict jointly explain the extent of political action in the 1980s. Democracy, state power, and institutional change help determine whether conflict takes the form of protest or rebellion.",

Yet, analyses of interstate interactions generally either assume independence among units or resort to technical solutions to dependence that \u201cthrow away\u201d relevant information. We detail a more informative and satisfying approach to modeling spatial dependence from extra-dyadic linkages in alliance ties and geographical proximity as specific pathways of conflict contagion. Beyond deterrence, the purpose of alliances is to draw other parties into dyadic contests, but most existing research on conflict onset generally only considers alliance ties within an individual dyad or external intervention in the same dispute. We develop new measures on third- and fourth-party alliance ties, demonstrating direct and indirect spatial effects of alliances on conflict onset. Similarly, ongoing contests can spread geographically, but dyads in some locations are much more at risk for conflict onset than others. We provide a new theory of geographic \u201cinbetweenness\u201d in conflict and show that dyads involving specific locations and ties to the ongoing conflict are much more likely to see dispute onset, even accounting for other purely dyadic factors. Beyond the intrinsic interest in the impacts of extra-dyadic position and alliances on conflict, our spatial approach can be applied more broadly to other extra-dyadic ties.",

A prominent debate has emerged among scholars and practitioners about the importance of winning civilian \u2018hearts and minds\u2019 for influencing their wartime behavior. We argue that such efforts may have a dark side: insurgents can use pro-counterinsurgent attitudes as cues to select their targets and tactics. We conduct an original survey experiment in 204 Afghan villages and establish a positive association between pro-International Security Assistance Force attitudes and future Taliban attacks. We extend our analysis to 14,606 non-surveyed villages and demonstrate that our measure of civilian attitudes improves out-of-sample predictive performance by 20\u201330% over a standard forecasting model. The results are especially strong for Taliban attacks with improvised explosive devices. These improvements in predictive power remain even after adjusting for possible confounders, including past violence, military bases, and development aid.",

            "abstract": "This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. These topics are then used in panel regressions to predict the onset of conflict. We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is a good predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when risk in previously peaceful countries arises. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms that make them able to capture the changing context of conflict. At the same time, topics provide width because they are summaries of the full text, including stabilizing factors.",

The models used to generate these forecasts were based on a specification from a machine learning algorithm fit to 2000 \u2013 2008 monthly data. The idea here is that for policy purposes we need models that can forecast conflict events before they occur. The model that includes previous month\u2019s wheat price performs better than a similar model which does not include past wheat prices (the univariate model). Both models did not perform well in forecasting conflict in a neighborhood of the 2012 \u201cHeglig Crisis\u201d. Such a result is generic, as \u201coutlier or unusual events\u201d are hard for models and policy experts to forecast.",

            "abstract": "Developing political forecasting models not only increases the ability of political scientists to inform public policy decisions, but is also relevant for scientific advancement. This article argues for and demonstrates the utility of creating forecasting models for predicting political conflicts in a diverse range of country settings. Apart from the benefit of making actual predictions, we argue that predictive heuristics are one gold standard of model development in the field of conflict studies. As such, they shed light on an array of important components of the political science literature on conflict dynamics. We develop and present conflict predictions that have been highly accurate for past and subsequent events, exhibiting few false-negative and false-positive categorizations. Our predictions are made at the monthly level for 6-month periods into the future, taking into account the social\u2013spatial context of each individual country. The model has a high degree of accuracy in reproducing historical data measured monthly over the past 10 years and has approximately equal accuracy in making forecasts. Thus, forecasting in political science is increasingly accurate. At the same time, by providing a gold standard that separates model construction from model evaluation, we can defeat observational research designs and use true prediction as a way to evaluate theories. We suggest that progress in the modeling of conflict research depends on the use of prediction as a gold standard of heuristic evaluation.",

Why then are some weak states prone to civil war while others are not? The author offers a theory that explains how dissidents and states interact to jointly produce civil war. In sum, states that repress their citizens are the most likely to kill citizens and to generate dissident violence. This insight resolves an academic puzzle and when tested provides a model with better predictive ability than previous models.",

Elsewhere, or perhaps in the same location, government forces are constructing a barricade and a politician is being abducted. These types of politically motivated conflictual events are always occurring. In most places, accounts of these events quickly make their way online in the form of electronic news stories. In this dissertation, I utilize a new datasets called the Global Dataset of Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT) which contains almost 200 million politically relevant events that have been extracted from freely available online news articles. With this data, I analyze the effects of political violence on the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, measure how much civil war effects interstate war, and build an empirical model that generates accurate predictions of future conflict in Afghanistan.",

It generates forecasts that (1) are accurate but account for uncertainty, (2) are produced in (near) real time, (3) capture actors\u2019 simultaneous behaviors, (4) incorporate prior beliefs, and (5) generate policy contingent forecasts. We combine the CAMEO event-coding framework with Markov-switching and Bayesian vector autoregression models to meet these goals. Our example produces a series of forecasts for material conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians for 2010. Our forecast is that the level of material conflict between these belligerents will increase in 2010, compared to 2009.",

This article explores whether the incorporation of geography can help us make our forecasts of political violence more accurate. The authors describe a spatially and temporally autoregressive discrete regression model, following the framework of Geyer and Thompson. This model is applied to geo-located data on attributes and conflict events in Bosnia over the period from March 1992 to October 1995. Results show that there is a strong spatial as well as temporal dimension to the outbreak of violence in Bosnia. The authors then explore the use of this model for predicting future conflict. Using a simulation approach, the predictive accuracy of the spatial\u2014temporal model is compared to a standard regression model that only includes time lags. The results show that even in a difficult out-of-sample prediction task, the incorporation of space improves our forecasts of future conflict.",

            "abstract": "Many in the media have depicted conflicts between the Western and Muslim worlds as a \u2018Clash of Civilizations\u2019 (CoC), and this has revived many of the questions surrounding the value of Samuel Huntington\u2019s CoC theory. Previous empirical tests have analysed his theory using low-level conflict at the interstate level or violent conflict at the subnational level. The former have demonstrated little or no empirical support for his theory, while the results in the latter group are mixed. This analysis adds to previous empirical studies in a number of ways. One, the empirical models test CoC exclusively in the post-Cold War era. Two, along with examining the civilizational determinants of military interstate disputes, as prior studies have done, I include models that focus exclusively on interstate wars, because Huntington frequently points out that a CoC between states will lead to violent political conflict. Finally, this study directly tests Huntington\u2019s civilizational \u2018fault lines\u2019 and Islamic \u2018bloody border\u2019 hypotheses. I include an extension and find that intra-civilizational conflict is relatively rare in the post-Cold War era. Contrary to earlier analyses, the data show strong empirical support for CoC, particularly when focusing on violent international conflict in the post-Cold War era, and the results are robust when testing the hypotheses with alternative data on international crises.",

The proposed framework would generate forecasts that 1) are accurate, 2) are produced in (near) real time, 3) address the actions of multiple actors in a conflict, 4) incorporate prior beliefs about conflict processes, and 5) allow us to generate policy contingent forecasts. We propose to meet these desiderata by combining the CAMEO event coding framework with Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) and Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregression (MS-BVAR) forecasting models. We outline an example using these methods and present some preliminary conclusions.",

How does one acquire that understanding? One technique is to model and understand the social factors, which summarize the background conditions, attributes and performance factors of the country over time. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) present a generalized data-driven framework for conflict analysis and forecasting, (2) show that state-of-the-art pattern classification techniques provide significant improvements to forecasting accuracy, and (3) introduce classification problems arising in social sciences to the engineering community for further enhancement of analysis techniques. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven framework on macro-structural factors as relevant contributors to country instability, delineating the independent and dependent variables. The results demonstrate significant improvement over previous approaches in classification metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall.",

            "abstract": "State failure has been traditionally defined as the collapse of national authority, which may be reflected in disasters such as wars and disruptive regime transitions. The availability of comprehensive datasets and the limitations exhibited by previous forecasting analyses led us to integrate different predictive resources and models through statistical analysis and machine learning. Here we demonstrate the predictive ability of unsupervised and supervised learning approaches to detecting meaningful relationships between country cases, encoded by several socio-economic indicators, and the emergence of violent conflicts. Two clustering-based analyses (Kohonen maps and a network-based approach) provided the basis for exploratory analyses that confirmed hypotheses about the relevance of the data and the differences between state failure types. We also illustrate the potential of a novel network-based clustering approach for sub-class discovery in the area of political instability analysis. Furthermore, we show significant relationships between the emergence of violent conflicts and a dataset of quantitative indicators of good governance, which allows the design of effective supervised and unsupervised classifiers. This study contributes to the development of intelligent data analysis techniques for supporting hypothesis generation and testing in international conflict analyses",

Unfortunately, these theoretical developments have been devoid of much practical application. In this article, the authors explore the feasibility of risk assessment in the study of these human rights. Borrowing an approach by Gurr and Moore, they construct a risk assessment vehicle that uses existing models and data to develop expectations about future increases and decreases in human rights abuses. Their results indicate that we can isolate a set of cases that are at a higher risk of experiencing increased human rights abuse in the following year, as well as those that are ripe for better protection of human rights. The authors expect these risk and opportunity assessments to be of interest to students of conflict and peace studies, as well as to human rights activists and policy makers.",

            "title": "The Devil in the Demographics: The Effect of Youth Bulges on Domestic Armed Conflict,",
            "abstract": "It has been suggested that large youth cohorts, so-called 'youth bulges', make countries more unstable in general, and thus more susceptible to armed conflict. In the present study this notion is put to an empirical test. The paper explores possible links between youth bulges, and violent conflict theoretically, and attempts to model under what conditions. and in what kind of contexts youth bulges can cause armed conflict. The research hypotheses are tested in an event history, statistical model covering a high number of countries, and politically dependent areas over the period 1950-2000. The study finds robust support for the hypothesis that youth bulges increase the risk of domestic armed conflict, and especially so under conditions of economic stagnation. Moreover, the lack of support for the youth bulge hypothesis in recent Bank studies, is found to arise from a serious weakness in the youth bulge measure employed by Bank researchers. The author finds no evidence for the claim made by Samuel P. Huntington that youth bulges above a certain 'critical level' make countries especially prone to conflict. The study, however, provides evidence that the combination of youth bulges, and poor economic performance can be explosive. This is bad news for regions that currently exhibit both features, often in coexistence with intermediary, and unstable political regimes, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Arab world. In addition to economic performance, a key factor that affects the conflict potential of youth bulges, is the opportunity for migration. Migration works as a safety valve for youth discontent.",

We note that they also agree with our main methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting performance should be a primary standard used to evaluate international conflict studies. However, we demonstrate that all other methodological conclusions drawn by de Marchi, Gelpi, and Gryanaviski are false. For example, by using the same evaluative criterion for both models, it is easy to see that their claim that properly specified logit models outperform neural network models is incorrect. Finally, we show that flexible neural network models are able to identify important empirical relationships between democracy and conflict that the logit model excludes a priori; this should not be surprising since the logit model is merely a limiting special case of the neural network model.",

            "title": "Using case studies to expand the theory of civil war",
            "abstract": "The Collier-Hoeffler (2000) model of civil war onset (henceforth called CH) has been very influential in shaping current research on the relationship between conflict and development. Its main thesis is that civil wars tend to occur not necessarily where there is more underlying political grievance or ethnic division, but where the organization of rebellion is financially viable. This paper extends and modifies the CH model by drawing causal inferences about the causes of civil war based on a set of comparative case studies designed to answer a set of questions central to the CH model. Overall, the case studies suggest that, while the CH model of war onset describes well the reality of some cases, it frequently falls short of making accurate predictions of the process through which civil war occurs. By taking a closer look at actual cases of civil war, this paper suggests several ways in which economic models of civil war such as the CH model could be improved. The paper is organized in the following sections, beyond the introduction and the conclusion. Section 2 provides a discussion of methodological concerns addressed by the case study. Section 3 provides a very brief overview of the CH model and the main empirical results of the model so as to create the context within which to evaluate the detailed discussion of the case study project. Section 4 begins the synthesis of the case studies by focusing on data measurement and operationalization of key variables, suggesting a number of refinements to the CH model. Section 5 draws on the findings of more than twenty case-studies to expand the theory underlying the CH model of civil war onset. Several modifications of the CH model are recommended, and empirical evidence supporting these recommendations is summarized by presenting illustrative examples from the case studies. These recommendations essentially add up to a new theoretical model that can be tested empirically if new variables are coded and included in the dataset. Section 6 concludes with an overview of the contribution of the case study project to the World Bank's research agenda in the Economics of Political and Criminal Violence.",

            "abstract": "Armed conflict is a major cause of injury and death worldwide, but we need much better methods of quantification before we can accurately assess its effect\n\nArmed conflict between warring states and groups within states have been major causes of ill health and mortality for most of human history. Conflict obviously causes deaths and injuries on the battlefield, but also health consequences from the displacement of populations, the breakdown of health and social services, and the heightened risk of disease transmission. Despite the size of the health consequences, military conflict has not received the same attention from public health research and policy as many other causes of illness and death. In contrast, political scientists have long studied the causes of war but have primarily been interested in the decision of elite groups to go to war, not in human death and misery.\n\nWe review the limited knowledge on the health consequences of conflict, suggest ways to improve measurement, and discuss the potential for risk assessment and for preventing and ameliorating the consequences of conflict.\n\n#### Summary points\n\nConflict related death and injury are major contributors to the global burden of disease\n\nInformation systems break down during conflict, leading to great uncertainty in the magnitude of mortality and disability\n\nThe World Health Survey may provide a reliable and valid basis for assessing conflict related mortality and disability\n\nForecasting models may provide a plausible basis for assessing risk of conflict and thus prevention\n\nImproved collaboration between political scientists and experts in public health would benefit measurement, prediction, and prevention of conflict related death\n\nThe impact of war on populations arises both from the direct effects of combat\u2014namely, battle deaths\u2014and from the indirect consequences of war, which may occur for several years after a conflict ends.1 Indirect effects of conflict on mortality can be formally \u2026",

Armed group presence is often used as the main variable of interest in several studies, and in some cases, this variable is ignored. Many of these studies use expert data or proxy variables to analyze armed group presence. This paper proposes Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as a method to identify armed group presence. HMMs permit identifying armed group presence at a sub-national level and in long panel data sets. A HMM is used in this paper to identify paramilitary and FARC presence in Colombia. The armed groups\u2019 presence predictions are used to analyze the effect of economic shocks on violence. It shows that economic shocks can have differential effects depending on the level of armed group presence in the territory.",

            "abstract": "How do insurgents choose their tactics in civil wars? While most theories of civil war violence marginalize the role of ideology, we argue that the location, type, and lethality of insurgent violence are all shaped by the underlying spatial distribution of civilians' relative support for combatants. Unlike current \"hearts and minds\" theories, we contend that pro-government attitudes are associated with increased, not reduced, violence, and that these attitudes predict future attacks. A survey experiment in 204 Afghan villages is used to establish a positive association between pro-International Security Assistance Force attitudes and future Taliban attacks. We extend our analysis to 14,606 non-surveyed villages, where our measure of civilian attitudes improves out-of-sample prediction by 20--30% over standard forecasting models. The results are especially strong for Taliban attacks with improvised explosive devices. These findings hold even after adjusting for possible confounders, including past violence, military bases, and aid.",

This article explores whether the incorporation of geography can help us make our forecasts of political violence more accurate. The authors describe a spatially and temporally autoregressive discrete regression model, following the framework of Geyer and Thompson. This model is applied to geo-located data on attributes and conflict events in Bosnia over the period from March 1992 to October 1995. Results show that there is a strong spatial as well as temporal dimension to the outbreak of violence in Bosnia. The authors then explore the use of this model for predicting future conflict. Using a simulation approach, the predictive accuracy of the spa tial-temporal model is compared to a standard regression model that only includes time lags. The results show that even in a difficult out-of-sample prediction task, the incorporation of space improves our forecasts of future conflict.",

Pearson Major: Political Science Degree: Doctor of Philosophy This dissertation is about conflict escalation to civil war, and examines why some political confrontations escalate and why principal conflict actors continue fighting rather than reaching a number of political arrangements at various points of the course of conflict. Unlike previous studies, this study treats the progression to civil war as one of complex alternate paths. In so doing, building on the perspective of asymmetric information (i.e. uncertainty) problems as a cause of war, this study claims that involving each conflict actor\u2019s cognitive variances about its opponent\u2019s willingness to resolve and military strength would bolster either side\u2019s costly military mobilization and boil over into civil war. Four extant hypotheses on conflict escalation and two specific propositions from a two-sided uncertainty perspective are tested with ordered and binary multiple logistic regression analyses against state-year aggregated data on government repression and armed resistance levels as well as civil war onset from 1976 to 2000. A comparative case illustration of the Lebanese civil war of 1975-1976 and the Northern Ireland conflict of 1970- 1998 further illuminates the internal conflict dynamics toward or away from civil war, examining the emergence of principal and secondary armed actors in the course of conflict. Both the quantitative and qualitative studies provide evidence for the roles of uncertainty in either",

This article argues for and demonstrates the utility of creating forecasting models for predicting political conflicts in a diverse range of country settings. Apart from the benefit of making actual predictions, we argue that predictive heuristics are one gold standard of model development in the field of conflict studies. As such, they shed light on an array of important components of the political science literature on conflict dynamics. We develop and present conflict predictions that have been highly accurate for past and subsequent events, exhibiting few false-negative and false-positive categorizations. Our predictions are made at the monthly level for 6-month periods into the future, taking into account the social\u2013spatial context of each individual country. The model has a high degree of accuracy in reproducing historical data measured monthly over the past 10 years and has approximately equal accuracy in making forecasts. Thus, forecasting in political science is increasingly accurate. At the same time, by providing a gold standard that separates model construction from model evaluation, we can defeat observational research designs and use true prediction as a way to evaluate theories. We suggest that progress in the modeling of",

            "abstract": "This article explores empirically the duration of civil war. It relates the duration of civil war to two alternative models of conflict and culls testable hypotheses from the case study literature on civil war. Using a comprehensive dataset on large-scale violent civil conflicts covering the 1960-2000 period, a wide range of hypotheses are tested by means of hazard function regressions. The results show that the duration of conflict is systematically related both to structural conditions prevailing prior to conflict and to circumstances during conflict. The key structural characteristics that lengthen conflict are low per capita income, high inequality and a moderate degree of ethnic division. The key variable characteristics that shorten conflict are a decline in the prices of the primary commodities that the country exports and external military intervention on the side of the rebels. Furthermore, the results indicate that the chances of peace were much lower in the 1980s and 1990s than they had been previously. Three empirical explanations are suggested as different approaches to civil war: rebellion-as-investment, in which the critical incentive is the post-conflict payoff; rebellion-as-business, in which the critical incentive is the payoff during conflict; and rebellion-as-mistake, in which military optimism prevents the recognition of any mutually advantageous settlement. The article concludes that the empirical evidence is incompatible with the first of these approaches but consistent with the others.",

Their empirical model of intervention allows them to analyze civil war duration, using\"expected\"rather than\"actual\"external intervention as an explanatory variable in the duration model. Unlike previous studies, they find that external intervention is positively associated with the duration of civil war. They distinguish partial third-party interventions that extend the length of war, from multilateral\"peace\"operations, which have a mandate to restore peace without taking sides - and which typically take place at war's end, or at least when both sides have agreed to a cease-fire. In a future paper, the authors will examine whether partial third-party interventions - whatever their effect on a war's duration - increase the risk of war's recurrence. If that proves true, then even if interventions reduce the length of civil war, they may do so at the cost of further destabilizing the political system, and sowing the seeds of future rebellion.",

Post-war this flight can either be reversed or continue, depending partly upon how far the capital stock has adjusted to the war. The model is tested on data for all civil wars since 1960. After long civil wars the economy recovers rapidly, whereas after short wars it continues to decline. We then consider the effect on the composition of economic activity, distinguishing between war-vulnerable and war-safe activities. Evidence for Uganda shows such compositional effects to be substantial.",

            "abstract": "The underlying risk factors associated with the duration and termination of biological, sociological, economic, or political processes often exhibit spatial clustering. However, existing nonspatial survival models, including those that account for \u201cimmune\u201d and \u201cat-risk\u201d subpopulations, assume that these baseline risks are spatially independent, leading to inaccurate inferences in split-population survival settings. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian spatial split-population survival model that addresses these methodological challenges by accounting for spatial autocorrelation among units in terms of their probability of becoming immune and their survival rates. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that, unlike nonspatial models, this spatial model provides accurate parameter estimates in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Applying our spatial model to data from published studies on authoritarian reversals and civil war recurrence reveals that accounting for spatial autocorrelation in split-population models leads to new empirical insights, reflecting the need to theoretically and statistically account for space and non-failure inflation in applied research.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study tested the effect of cooperative concept mapping on knowledge achievement and transfer in peace education on 159 social studies students using a quasi-experimental research design. Four intact classes\u2014two each in rural and urban areas\u2014were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions, and two instruments\u2014Peace Education Achievement Test and Peace Education Transferability Test\u2014were used for data collection. Findings showed that cooperative concept mapping unveiled students\u2019 misconceptions in peace education and their perceptions about violent behaviors, raised students\u2019 consciousness about asymmetric structures undermining peace, empowered them with ability to establish connections between intrinsic and extrinsic causes of conflict, and encouraged practical suggestions on how to resolve conflict and promote peace through enactment of peace virtues. Bivariate associations showed that students\u2019 achievement in one context correlated with their transfer of learning in another context, with stronger correlation exhibited among experimental students. We attributed the stronger correlation recorded among experimental students to the \u201cconcepts connection\u201d and visual effect occasioned by concept maps and overt effort of experimental teachers to create cooperative, experiential, and learner-centered lessons. Also, our assumption that female students will do better than male students in peace education was met. Implications of findings for curriculum review, instructional delivery and teacher education were discussed.",

            "title": "The Spatial Concentration of Peacekeeping Personnel and Public Health During Intrastate Conflicts",
            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The literature on the effectiveness of peacekeeping has been focused almost exclusively on conflict mitigation. This article expands the scope of this literature by developing a theory that explains how the presence of peacekeeping forces improves population health during periods of intrastate conflict. The argument is put forth that because civil conflict violence clusters geographically it undermines the herd immunity critical-mass threshold. This, in turn, leads to increased infection rates and a tragic surge in preventable deaths. Peacekeepers, because they target conflict \u2018hot spots\u2019 locally, put an end to this cycle and assist in the restoration herd immunity. Using a unique measure of peacekeeping that accounts for the area of the conflict zone, the empirical models uncover a positive relationship between peacekeeping forces and immunization rates, as vaccination rates increase when peacekeepers are deployed into violent conflicts. These findings suggest that peacekeeping missions have the potential to reduce the public health costs imposed by internal conflicts.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Why have peace-building and reconstruction efforts so frequently failed to create durable institutions that can deter or withstand resurgent violence in volatile sites of cyclical conflict? Extant theory predicts that new institutions can help overcome violence and mitigate commitment problems in postconflict contexts by reducing uncertainty in inherently uncertain environments. By contrast, this article argues that postconflict institutions often prove limited in their abilities to contribute to durable peace because they offer wartime elites new venues in which to pursue conflict-era agendas. Through a micro-analysis of efforts to build the rule of law in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, I demonstrate that wartime elites capture and instrumentalize new legal institutions to maximize their intra- and inter-organizational survival; to pursue economic, military, and political agendas behind the scenes; and, in some cases, to prepare for an imminent return to war.",

            "abstract": "Studies of civil war have shown the strategic influence of geography and space on the occurrence of conflict. While civil wars cluster and spread between states in international neighborhoods, ethnic groups within states consider their geography and location in choosing to foment rebellion. In answering why some ethnic groups turn to civil war, I unify and build on these ideas to develop a theory that ethnic civil wars follow patterns of contagion within states. I contend that ongoing conflicts in groups\u2019 geographic proximity provides increased logistic and strategic opportunity for successful rebellion. Using spatially weighted regressions, I find evidence that ethnic civil wars are contagious within states and that such intrastate contagion is robust to other intra- and interstate neighborhood effects that may alter groups\u2019 calculus of rebellion. These insights consistently demonstrate that accounting for groups\u2019 broader strategic surroundings yields important implications for the study of civil war.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The impact of natural resources on intrastate violence has been increasingly analyzed in the peace and conflict literature. Surprisingly, little quantitative evidence has been gathered on the effects of the resource-ownership structure on internal violence. This article uses a novel data set on oil and natural gas property rights, covering 40 countries during the period 1989\u20132010. The results of regression analyses employing logit models reveal that the curvilinear effect between hydrocarbon production and civil conflict onset\u2014often found in previous studies\u2014only applies to countries in which oil and gas is extracted by state-owned companies. The findings suggest that only state-controlled hydrocarbon production might entail peace-buying mechanisms such as specific clientelistic practices, patronage networks, welfare policies, and/or coercion. At the same time, it seems that greed and grievance are more pronounced whenever resources lie in the hands of the state. Exploring the within-country variation, further analyses reveal that divergent welfare spending patterns are likely to be one causal channel driving the relationship between resource ownership and internal violence.",

            "abstract": "The thesis explores the causes and dynamics of the conflict that has lasted for decades in the oil rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. I critically examined the main theories that have been previously used to explain the conflict particularly the dominant greed/grievance paradigm. I argue that the greed/grievance theory does not adequately explain the conflict as it is difficult to distinguish behaviours that could be labelled as greed or grievance. Instead, the thesis argues that the human security framework better explains the causes and dynamics of the conflict experienced in this region. \nA three month ethnographic study which involved in-depth interviews, observation, group interview and document analysis was carried out in the three highest oil producing states in the region. The ethnography focused on the activities of the three main stakeholders (the government, MNCS and indigenes of selected communities) as well as other stakeholders like NGOs and human rights activists. Two key issues were critically explored: the impact of oil exploration on the human security of the indigenes and whether or not direct distribution of resources could reduce the level of human insecurity and the resultant conflict in the region. \nA thorough analysis of the data obtained from the field trip reveals that problems relating to governance of distribution of resources and not necessarily resource scarcity are the key sources of human insecurity in the region. The results further show that the three major stakeholders in the region contributed to the human insecurity experienced in the region. Further analysis of the forms of resource distribution used in the region shows that a bottom-up model of resource distribution with the active participation of all the major stakeholders could help improve on the human security in the region as well as reduce conflict.",

La extensa cantidad de variables socioeconomicas disponibles en las bases de datos analizadas hace necesario utilizar una metodologia de analisis de componentes principales para elegir aquellas con mayor poder explicativo. En adicion, se construye un modelo probabilistico para determinar cuales variables tienen una mayor probabilidad de sostener la paz. La evidencia sugiere que entre los factores mas relevantes que incrementan la probabilidad de una paz duradera son: la ayuda internacional, el capital fisico, la infraestructura, la tecnologia, las condiciones macroeconomicas y el valor agregado de la produccion nacional.",

Economic growth reduces the probability of civil war and the vulnerability to climate change. Climate change increases the probability of civil war. The impacts of climate change, civil war and civil war in the neighbouring countries reduce economic growth. The model has two potential poverty traps \u2013 one is climate-change-induced and one is civil-war-induced \u2013 and the two poverty traps may reinforce one another. The model is calibrated to sub-Saharan Africa and a double Monte Carlo analysis is conducted in order to account for both parameter uncertainty and stochasticity. Although the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) is used as the baseline, thus assuming rapid economic growth in Africa and convergence of African living standards to the rest of the world, the impacts of civil war and climate change (ignored in SRES) are sufficiently strong to keep a number of countries in Africa in deep poverty with a high probability.",

            "title": "Do Religious Factors Impact Armed Conflict? Empirical Evidence From Sub-Saharan Africa",
            "abstract": "Theoretically, the \u201cmobilization hypothesis\u201d establishes a link between religion and conflict by arguing that particular religious structures are prone to mobilization; once politicized, escalation to violent conflict becomes more likely. Yet, despite the religious diversity in sub-Saharan Africa and the religious overtones in a number of African conflicts, this assumption has not yet been backed by systematic empirical research on the religion\u2013conflict nexus in the region. The following questions thus remain: Do religious factors significantly impact the onset of (religious) armed conflict? If so, do they follow the logic of the mobilization hypothesis and, if so, in which way? To answer these questions, this article draws on a unique data inventory of all sub-Saharan countries for the period 1990\u20132008, particularly including data on mobilization-prone religious structures (e.g., demographic changes, parallel ethno-religious identities) as well as religious factors indicating actual politicization of religion (e.g., inter-religious tensions, religious discrimination, incitement by religious leaders). Logit regressions suggest that religion indeed plays a significant role in African armed conflicts. These findings are compatible with the mobilization hypothesis, and stress the impact of conflict-prone religious structures, and particularly, the fact that overlaps of religious and ethnic identities are conflict-prone. Future research should investigate the religion-ethnicity-nexus in more detail.",

            "abstract": "Violent conflicts have become one of the major concerns of modern nation states. Regardless of their political, social, and economic conjunctures, nations are increasingly exposed to the risk of conflicts. Conflicts are generally categorized as \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d based on the level of intensity and the number ofcasualties. The Middle East has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of conflicts since the early 1990s. In this chapter we examine the causes that triggered unprecedented changes in conflicts by using a panel of conflict estimates for 10 Middle Eastern nations for the period 1963\u20131999. The fixed effects model is used to control for unobservable country-specific effects that result in a missing-variable bias in cross-sectional studies. More importantly, the fixed effects model is chosen since the main goal of this study is to investigate what factors have caused statistically significant changes in conflicts over time within nations rather than to explain variation in conflicts across these nations. On the basis of the panel data, we explain the roles of inequality, inflation, growth, military spending, foreign direct investment, and remittances in the surge in conflicts in the Middle East.",

            "abstract": "Geographic and cross\u2010national variation in the frequency of intrastate armed conflict and civil war is a subject of great interest. Previous theory on this variation has focused on the influence on human behaviour of climate, resource competition, national wealth, and cultural characteristics. We present the parasite\u2010stress model of intrastate conflict, which unites previous work on the correlates of intrastate conflict by linking frequency of the outbreak of such conflict, including civil war, to the intensity of infectious disease across countries of the world. High intensity of infectious disease leads to the emergence of xenophobic and ethnocentric cultural norms. These cultures suffer greater poverty and deprivation due to the morbidity and mortality caused by disease, and as a result of decreased investment in public health and welfare. Resource competition among xenophobic and ethnocentric groups within a nation leads to increased frequency of civil war. We present support for the parasite\u2010stress model with regression analyses. We find support for a direct effect of infectious disease on intrastate armed conflict, and support for an indirect effect of infectious disease on the incidence of civil war via its negative effect on national wealth. We consider the entanglements of feedback of conflict into further reduced wealth and increased incidence of disease, and discuss implications for international warfare and global patterns of wealth and imperialism.",

            "abstract": "This article investigates the relationship between civil war onset and state capacity through a focus on the role of primary commodities. This is accomplished by moving the focus of the civil war literature away from an almost exclusive concern with the incentives of rebels to a consideration of both rebels and rulers as revenue seeking predators. This predatory theory approach expects that higher levels of state capacity should deter civil war onset, while civil war onset should reduce state capacity. Further, natural resource rents are expected to enhance state capacity, rather than increase the likelihood of civil war onset. In order to deal with the endogeneity posed by including fiscal measures of state capacity in single equation models of civil war onset, this study employs a simultaneous equations framework. This framework allows us to capture the effects of civil war onset on state capacity and vice versa, as well as the effects of primary commodities on both endogenous covariates. The main findings from the statistical analyses include: state capacity does not affect civil war onset, but civil war onset reduces state capacity; and primary products directly affect only state capacity \u2014 they do not directly affect civil war onset, as found in previous contributions to the literature.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has increasingly questioned the link between natural resources and violent conflict while stressing the importance of resource-specific context conditions under which internal conflicts become more likely. This paper engages in a systematic analysis of six of these resource-specific conditions comparing 15 African oil and diamond producing countries. Employing a Boolean logic, the results of our analysis indicate that, typically, a conflict-ridden diamond or oil producer is highly dependent on resources, its revenues are hardly spent on distributional policies and the security apparatus and, moreover, it suffers from intercommunal problems in the producing regions. Little income from resources per capita and substantial production of lootable resources in peripheral regions seem to constitute necessary conditions for civil war. Thus, our findings imply that future theoretical models and empirical strategies should integrate the full set of (resource specific) context conditions. Efforts to raise a more integrative approach combining quantitative and qualitative research designs seem particularly promising.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that the personal influence model (PIM) be used strategically to resolve conflicts and social crises in Africa. It presents PIM as a complementary, analytic discourse to participatory communication, a development paradigm commonly used globally in a variety of social programs. That discourse, as a framework for theory building, is grounded in Africa's emerging and enduring realities: (a) the growing interest of the international community to assist Africa to meet the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, whose focus is to reduce extreme poverty by 2015; (b) the ephemeral nature of Africa's political and social stability that necessitates reducing fear, improving community security, nurturing public trust, and building inter-group relationships, all as preconditions for attaining social development, and for using a community-agency- contracts-partnerships approach to deliver development services; and (c) the palpable congruence of PIM with Africa's extensive social networks, which are typically used as communication tools for social development. Those realities guide four propositions that serve as a heuristic template for testing and refining the participatory approach, thereby guiding theory building in participatory communication in African communities. That template identifies an expansive three-concept research agenda \u2013 culture, community governance and rule of law, and economic freedom \u2013 that raises questions, defines concepts, measures key variables, and assesses outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative scholarship on civil wars has long debated whether ethnic diversity breeds armed conflict. We go beyond this debate and show that highly diverse societies are not more conflict prone. Rather, states characterized by certain ethnopolitical configurations of power are more likely to experience violent conflict. First, armed rebellions are more likely to challenge states that exclude large portions of the population on the basis of ethnic background. Second, when a large number of competing elites share power in a segmented state, the risk of violent infighting increases. Third, incohesive states with a short history of direct rule are more likely to experience secessionist conflicts. We test these hypotheses for all independent states since 1945 using the new Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) data set. Cross-national analysis demonstrates that ethnic politics is as powerful and robust in predicting civil wars as is a country's level of economic development. Using multinomial logit regression, we show that rebellion, infighting, and secession result from high degrees of exclusion, segmentation, and incohesion, respectively. More diverse states, on the other hand, are not more likely to suffer from violent conflict.",

            "abstract": "Civil wars in Africa are now the leading contributory cause of vulnerability of rural communities. Understanding vulnerability during civil war is critical for humanitarian response and post-conflict rehabilitation planning. The lack of understanding of vulnerability has led existing studies to make sweeping generalizations, either by equating the dynamics of vulnerability during civil wars with vulnerability in other risk events, or by projecting people in the 'war zones' as unable to cope and subsequently becoming vulnerable. This paper is an attempt to gain a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of vulnerability during protracted civil war. It shows that during civil war the non-poor are not necessarily less vulnerable than poor households. The idea that people caught up in civil war are all vulnerable is not supported by the findings of this paper. It shows that the 'standard' pattern of vulnerability to drought is similar to that during exogenous counter-insurgency warfare, while a different pattern of vulnerability to endogenous shocks is identified.",

Building on the civil war literature, we offer a broad explanatory model of variation in violence risk in the developing world.

            "abstract": "JACOB D. KATHMAN: The Geopolitics of Civil War Intervention. (Under the direction of Mark Crescenzi.) The regional interests of third party interveners are critical determinants of intervention in civil war. Foreign policymakers often tout the importance of regional stability when justifying their intervention decisions, as civil wars have shown a distinct tendency to be geographically contagious. Third parties observe these regional diffusion properties and consider a war\u2019s likelihood of infecting its regional context when deciding whether or not to become involved. As a third party becomes increasingly able to contain a civil war\u2019s hostilities from spreading into a region of foreign policy value to the potential intervener, intervention to contain the conflict becomes increasingly likely. I draw on theories of war diffusion and intervention to construct a model of intervention decision making, focusing on third party interests in the containment of conflict hostilities. Hypotheses derived from this model are then tested on the population of potential interveners for all civil wars in the post\u2013World War II period. The empirical results support the theoretical arguments put forth in the intervention model, as third parties are shown to intervene in conflicts that threaten the third party\u2019s regional stability interests. In addition, the relative effectiveness of intervention as a tool for containing civil war hostilities is empirically tested. The findings indicate that interventions increase the likelihood of regional contagion in the short\u2013term, but decrease its likelihood in the long\u2013term. The theoretical and empirical advances of this dissertation represent the first study to directly address how the contagious properties of civil conflicts affect intervention phenomena.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines oil-dependence and civil conflict in Nigeria focusing on the economic dynamics of resource-induced conflicts. It identifies two dimensions to oil-related civil conflict in the country. The first is the violent rent-seeking political violence that oil-availability generates between the various ethno-regional groups; the second is the Niger Delta crisis. The former is linked to excessive government dependence on oil revenues, an institutionally unstable revenue allocation system, weak political institutional arrangements, lack of effective agencies of restraints to demand transparency and accountability on the part of political office holders, failure to translate oil wealth to sustainable growth and increased standard of living for a larger majority of Nigerians, and a defective property right structure in relation to mineral resource endowment. Violence in the Niger Delta area is attributed, in the main, to weak institutional arrangements manifesting in poorly-conceived laws, lack of enforcement, .regulatory capture., and a marriage of interest between the State and oil companies which often encourage the State to use repressive measures against host communities in cases of disputes. There are also the looting and secession incentives as well as the rentseeking contests that oil-availability and the allure of ownership creates among local participants. Three factors (educational attainment, income level and asset possession) consistently explain the propensity to general violence among individuals in the region in the Ordered and Multinomial regressions on civil disobedience. The paper concludes with a discussion of some measures that may be used to break the conflict trap and overcome the corrupting influence of oil-dependence in Nigeria.",

However, extant empirical works test the effect of third-party enforcement but not the impact of domestic institutions on peace after civil wars. Hence, I test the impact of democracy, presidential, and parliamentary institutions, electoral systems\u2014PR and majoritarian\u2014and third-party enforcement by the UN on the durability of peace after termination of civil wars. Results from a bootstrapped Weibull duration model show that democracy and the PR electoral system significantly reduces the likelihood that civil war may recur, but that third-party enforcement by the UN does not have a significant effect on the hazard rate of peace spells. A brief case study analysis of recent attempts to build democratic institutions in Cambodia and Kosovo by the international community also supports the claims posited in this article.",

            "title": "Gender equality and civil wars",
            "abstract": "A recent trend in post-Cold War international relations research reveals a new-found interest in intrastate conflict, which occurs more frequently than interstate war. Scholars studying intrastate conflict either focus on the underlying social conditions leading to domestic conflict or on the rational calculation preceding a decision to use violence. In general, the political science literature on intrastate conflict emphasizes the role of prevailing domestic norms in predicting intrastate conflict. Such studies center on the role of ethnicity in predicting intrastate conflict and reveal that most intrastate conflict is ethnic based. What is missing from the research, however, is an examination of the cultural roles assigned to women and the overall impact of gender on intrastate violence. In general, countries characterized by gender inequality are more likely to be involved in interstate disputes and more likely to rely on violence to settle those disputes. Consequently, there is reason to believe that gender equality will also have an impact on intrastate conflict. This research project adds to our knowledge on the causes of intrastate conflict in two ways. First, this project further tests the general theoretical assertions concerning the role of social conditions in predicting intrastate conflict. Second, this research synthesizes feminist literature and theoretical expectations with the more traditional, presumably gender neutral but actually male-centric understanding of intrastate conflict. It is believed that greater levels of gender inequality will help predict the likelihood of domestic conflict thereby helping to identify those states most likely to become embroiled in domestic conflict. After first providing the relevant theoretical and conceptual arguments regarding intrastate conflict, the author provides an analysis of structural violence and its potential role in predicting intrastate violence. Next, feminist literature illuminating the role of gender inequality and discrimination in nationalist uprisings is explored. Then the impact of gender inequality on the likelihood of intrastate conflict is empirically examine through logistic regression. Ultimately, the aim is to discover whether domestic gender equality reduces the occurrence of intrastate violence. This project supports a body of research in international relations and comparative politics predicting intrastate conflict based on such malignant societal characteristics as domestic inequality and discrimination.",

            "abstract": "Although strategic interaction is at the heart of most international relations theory, it has largely been missing from much empirical analysis in the field. Typical applications of logit and probit to theories of international conflict generally do not capture the structure of the strategic interdependence implied by those theories. I demonstrate how to derive statistical discrete choice models of international conflict that directly incorporate the theorized strategic interaction. I show this for a simple crisis interaction model and then use Monte Carlo analysis to show that logit provides estimates with incorrect substantive interpretations as well as fitted values that can be far from the true values. Finally, I reanalyze a well-known game-theoretic model of war, Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international interaction game. My results indicate that there is at best modest empirical support for their model.",

In this article, we test both their economic and their political prescriptions for peace, using pooled-regression analyses of politically relevant dyads for the Cold War era. We find that the pacific benefits of trade, both total and dyadic, have not been sufficiently appreciated. We also offer clear evidence that democracies are relatively unlikely to become involved in militarized disputes with other democracies, while autocracies and democracies are prone to conflict with each other. Since democratic dyads are more peaceful than autocratic dyads, it follows that democracies are more peaceful than autocratic states generally, ceteris paribus. Previous research at the national level of analysis, which led most to conclude that democracies have been no more peaceful than other states, did not consider that the incidence of conflict depends importantly upon the number of contiguous states, the character of their political regimes, and other factors. In addition, we find no evidence that states that have recently undergone regime changes, whether in the democratic or autocratic direction, are particularly conflict prone. Our results suggest the basis for a broader formulation of expected\u2013utility theories of interstate conflict.",

            "abstract": "International relations theorists tend to think in terms of continuous processes. Yet we observe only discrete events, such as wars or alliances, and summarize them in terms of the frequency of occurrence. As such, most empirical analyses in international relations are based on event count variables. Unfortunately, analysts have generally relied on statistical techniques that were designed for continuous data. This mismatch between theory and method has caused bias, inefficiency, and numerous inconsistencies in both theoretical arguments and empirical findings throughout the literature. This article develops a much more powerful approach to modeling and statistical analysis based explicity on estimating continuous processes from observed event counts. To demonstrate this class of models, I present several new statistical techniques developed for and applied to different areas of international relations. These include the influence of international alliances on the outbreak of war, the contagious process of multilateral economic sanctions, and reciprocity in superpower conflict. I also show how one can extract considerably more information from existing data and relate substantive theory to empirical analyses more explicitly with this approach.",

            "abstract": "Measuring the intensity of events is crucial for monitoring and tracking armed conflict. Advances in automated event extraction have yielded massive data sets of \u201cwho did what to whom\u201d micro-records that enable data-driven approaches to monitoring conflict. The Goldstein scale is a widely-used expert-based measure that scores events on a conflictual\u2013cooperative scale. It is based only on the action category (\u201cwhat\u201d) and disregards the subject (\u201cwho\u201d) and object (\u201cto whom\u201d) of an event, as well as contextual information, like associated casualty count, that should contribute to the perception of an event\u2019s \u201cintensity\u201d. This paper takes a latent variable-based approach to measuring conflict intensity. We introduce a probabilistic generative model that assumes each observed event is associated with a latent intensity class. A novel aspect of this model is that it imposes an ordering on the classes, such that higher-valued classes denote higher levels of intensity. The ordinal nature of the latent variable is induced from naturally ordered aspects of the data (e.g., casualty counts) where higher values naturally indicate higher intensity. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically, showing that it obtains comparatively good held-out predictive performance.",

            "title": "A shape-based approach to conflict forecasting",
            "abstract": "Abstract Do conflict processes exhibit repeating patterns over time? And if so, can we exploit the recurring shapes and structures of the time series to forecast the evolution of conflict? Theory has long focused on the sequence of events that precedes conflicts (e.g., escalation or brinkmanship). Yet, current empirical research is unable to represent these complex interactions unfolding over time because it attempts to match cases on the raw value of covariates, and not on their structure or shape. As a result, it cannot easily represent real-world relations which may, for example, follow a long alternation of escalation and d\u00e9tente, in various orders and at various speeds. Here, I aim to address these issues using recent machine-learning methods derived from pattern recognition in time series to study the dynamics of casualties in civil war processes. I find that the methods perform well on out-of-sample forecasts of the count of the number of fatalities per month from state-based conflict. In particular, our results yield Mean Squared Errors that are lower than the competition benchmark. We discuss the implication for conflict research and the importance of comparing entire sequences rather than isolated observations in time. \u00bfLos procesos de conflicto muestran patrones que se repiten con el paso del tiempo? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfpodemos aprovechar las formas y estructuras recurrentes de las series temporales para prever la evoluci\u00f3n del conflicto? Durante mucho tiempo, la teor\u00eda se ha centrado en la secuencia de acontecimientos que preceden a los conflictos (por ejemplo, la escalada o la pol\u00edtica suicida). Sin embargo, la investigaci\u00f3n emp\u00edrica actual es incapaz de representar estas complejas interacciones que surgen a lo largo del tiempo porque trata de comparar los casos en funci\u00f3n del valor bruto de las covariables, y no de su estructura o forma. Por consiguiente, no puede representar f\u00e1cilmente las relaciones del mundo real que, por ejemplo, pueden seguir una larga alternancia de escalada y distensi\u00f3n, en varios \u00f3rdenes y a distintas velocidades. En este art\u00edculo, mi objetivo es abordar estas cuestiones utilizando m\u00e9todos recientes de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico derivados del reconocimiento de patrones en series temporales para estudiar la din\u00e1mica de las bajas en los procesos de guerra civil. Me parece que los m\u00e9todos funcionan bien en las previsiones fuera de muestra y, en particular, arrojan Errores Cuadr\u00e1ticos Medios inferiores a la referencia de la competencia. Se analizan las implicaciones para la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos y la importancia de comparar secuencias completas en lugar de observaciones aisladas en el tiempo. Les processus de conflit pr\u00e9sentent-ils des sch\u00e9mas qui se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent au fil du temps ? Et si tel est le cas, pouvons-nous exploiter ces formes et structures r\u00e9currentes de la chronologie pour pr\u00e9dire l\u2019\u00e9volution du conflit ? La th\u00e9orie s\u2019est longtemps concentr\u00e9e sur la s\u00e9quence d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de les conflits (p. ex. escalade ou strat\u00e9gie du bord de l\u2019ab\u00eeme). Pourtant, les recherches empiriques actuelles ne sont pas en mesure de repr\u00e9senter ces interactions complexes qui se d\u00e9roulent au fil du temps car elles tentent d\u2019apparier des cas sur la base de la valeur brute de leurs covariables, et non sur celle de leur structure ou de leur forme. Elles ne parviennent par cons\u00e9quent pas \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter facilement les relations du monde r\u00e9el qui peuvent, par exemple, suivre une longue alternance entre escalade et d\u00e9tente, dans divers ordres et \u00e0 diverses vitesses. Mon objectif est ici d\u2019aborder ces probl\u00e8mes en utilisant de r\u00e9centes m\u00e9thodes de machine learning d\u00e9riv\u00e9es de la reconnaissance des sch\u00e9mas des chronologies pour \u00e9tudier les dynamiques des pertes lors des processus de guerre civile. Je constate que ces m\u00e9thodes sont performantes pour les pr\u00e9visions hors \u00e9chantillon, et en particulier qu\u2019elles produisent des erreurs quadratiques moyennes inf\u00e9rieures par comparaison \u00e0 leurs m\u00e9thodes concurrentes.

            "abstract": "Existing research provides no systematic insights into if and how mediation impedes battle-related deaths. Therefore, this article presents a temporally disaggregated analysis and assesses the effect of mediation on monthly fatal violence. The article predicts that adversaries evaluate opponents\u2019 trustworthiness from both fighting and negotiation behavior. It argues that reducing fighting intensity during negotiations is a sign of cooperation, which can be negotiated by mediators to build trust. Over the course of mediation, the content of negotiations provides information about how genuinely a conflict party is interested in conflict resolution. Only if mediation achieves negotiation of core incompatibilities will conflict parties be willing to reduce fighting intensity. Under these conditions, information revealed in a mediation process can build trust and substantively reduce violence. An empirical analysis of all African conflicts between 1993 and 2007 supports this prediction and shows that on average mediation is followed by substantive and lasting reductions in fatal violence, if mediation discusses the conflict\u2019s main incompatibility. In contrast, mediation on other topics is associated with a small, fleeting reduction in violence. Data of battle-related fatalities in Syria during negotiations as well as qualitative evidence further support the theoretical mechanism and the model prediction. The study concludes that mediation can reduce conflict intensity substantively, if it achieves exchange between conflict parties on the main conflict issues.",

            "abstract": "Scholars and practitioners in international relations have a strong interest in forecasting international conflict. However, due to the complexity of forecasting rare events, existing attempts to predict the onset of international conflict in a cross-national setting have generally had low rates of success. In this paper, we apply Bayesian methods to develop a forecasting model designed to predict the onset of international conflict at the yearly level. We find that this model performs substantially better at producing accurate predictions both in and out of sample.",

While measuring the temporal aspect of this phenomenon is straightforward, measuring whether occurrences of violence are truly related to elections is more difficult. Using machine learning, we measure electoral violence across three elections using disaggregated reporting in social media. We demonstrate that our methodology is more than 30 percent more accurate in measuring electoral violence than previously utilized models. Additionally, we show that our measures of electoral violence conform to theoretical expectations of this conflict more so than those that exist in event datasets commonly utilized to measure electoral violence including ACLED, ICEWS, and SCAD. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our data by developing a qualitative coding ontology.",

The research focuses on a probabilistic statistical model used to determine the probability of military conflict eruption in the form of a Bayesian network. The complexity of military conflict modeling is caused by a large-scale dynamics of interacting systems with a large number of unknown or immeasurable variables and parameters. The resulting model incorporates the incompleteness and fuzziness of the available information. Consequently, the model is aimed at revealing the existing relationships and dependencies between the selected processes as well as the future conflicts probability forecasting based on the current situation analysis. Furthermore, the research presents the modeling procedure with the use of the available statistical data, describes a series of computing experiments, and analyses the results. Statistical data used for sampling was taken from public sources. The created model was used to measure the probability of internal and external conflicts in Ukraine. The obtained numerical results correspond to the current situation.",

I argue that an excessive focus on \u201cblack swans\u201d or surprising events that are hard to forecast detracts from considering the more frequent \u201cwhite swans\u201d or regularities in conflict. It is often more useful to focus on modal conflicts than exceptions, and substantial progress has been made in recent research. I identify some key lessons learned and highlight the need for researchers to distinguish between features that are more or less difficult to forecast.",

Predictive models aim to specify a probabilistic model that provides a good fit to testing data that were not used to estimate the model\u2019s parameters. Our goals are threefold. First, we review the central benefits of this under-utilized approach from a perspective uncommon in the existing literature: we focus on how predictive modeling can be used to complement and augment standard associational analyses. Second, we advance the state of the literature by laying out a simple set of benchmark predictive criteria. Third, we illustrate our approach through a detailed application to the prediction of interstate conflict.",

            "abstract": "Does the recurrence of wars suggest that we fail to recognize dangerous situations for what they are, and are doomed to repeat the errors of the past? Or rather that policymakers correctly anticipate the consequences of their actions but knowingly choose conflict? Unfortunately, little is known about how well wars are anticipated. Do conflicts tend to come as a surprise? I estimated the risk of war as perceived by contemporaries of all interstate and intrastate conflicts between 1816 and 2007. Using historical financial data of government bond yields, I find that market participants tend to underestimate the risk of war prior to its onset, and to react with surprise immediately thereafter. This result illustrates how conflict forecasts can be self-fulfilling or self-defeating. Present predictions may affect future behavior, such that wars may be less likely to occur when they are predicted, but more likely when they are not. I also show that the forecasting record has not improved over the past 200 years, and that wars involving democracies lead to greater market shocks. These findings also have implications for the way decisionmakers respond to new information, and how audiences perceive the risk of war and hence their leaders\u2019 actions.",

            "abstract": "Advances in the study of civil war have led to the proliferation of event count data, and to a corresponding increase in the use of (zero-inflated) count models for the quantitative analysis of civil conflict events. Our ability to effectively use these techniques is met with two current limitations. First, researchers do not yet have a definitive answer as to whether zero-inflated count models are a verifiably better approach to civil conflict modeling than are \u2018less assuming\u2019 approaches such as negative binomial count models. Second, the accurate analysis of conflict-event counts with count models \u2013 zero-inflated or otherwise \u2013 is severely limited by the absence of an effective framework for the evaluation of predictive accuracy, which is an empirical approach that is of increasing importance to conflict modelers. This article rectifies both of these deficiencies. Specifically, this study presents count forecasting techniques for the evaluation and comparison of count models' predictive accuracies. Using these techniques alongside out-of-sample forecasts, it then definitively verifies \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that zero-inflated count models are superior to comparable non-inflated models for the study of intrastate conflict events.",

            "abstract": "Prediction is an important goal in the study of international conflict, but a large body of research has found that existing statistical models generally have disappointing predictive abilities. We show that most efforts build on models unlikely to be helpful for prediction. Many models essentially ignore the origins of conflict; studies look either at invariant structural features believed to affect the opportunities of conflict, or at factors that are believed to reduce the baseline risk of conflict, without attempting to identify the potential motivations and contentious issues over which conflicts typically arise. Researchers that have considered how contentious issues may motivate conflict and how these can be managed, using the Issues Correlates of War (ICOW) data, have not considered how these features may inform prediction. We assess the risk of dyadic interstate conflict based on the presence of specific contentious issues and conflict management events that may change the conflict potential of these contentious issues. We evaluate to what extent incorporating contentious issues and conflict management can help improve out-of-sample forecasting, as well as advance our understanding of conflict dynamics. Our results provide strong support for the idea that taking into account contentious issues can inform and improve out-of-sample forecasting.",

(1972) hypothesized that the distribution of military\u2014industrial capabilities among the major powers, as reflected in an index referred to as CON, would have an impact on the incidence of war for those states. Subsequent research on the possible connection between CON and interstate conflict has continued for almost four decades. A recent book declares that CON is the single most potent predictor of interstate conflict. However, theoretical arguments linking CON to conflict tend to be implausible or illogical. Furthermore, empirical analyses over the years have produced inconsistent results. These problems cannot be traced to flaws in CON. The long history of CON suggests that models of interstate conflict would benefit from more cogent theoretical bases for choices of individual variables, as well as the set of variables included in those models.",

            "abstract": "The quantitative study of conflict management is concerned with finding models which are accurate and also capable of providing a causal interpretation of results. This dissertation applies computational intelligence methods to study interstate disputes. Both multilayer perceptron neural networks and Takagi-Sugeno neuro-fuzzy models are used to model interstate interactions. The multilayer perceptron neural network is trained in the Bayesian framework, using the Hybrid Monte Carlo method to sample from the posterior probabilities. It is found that the network is able to forecast conflict with an accuracy of 77.3%. A hybrid machine learning method using the neural network and the genetic algorithm is then presented as a method of suggesting how conflict can be brought under control. The automatic relevance determination approach and the sensitivity analysis are used as methods of extracting causal information from the neural network. The Takagi-Sugeno neuro-fuzzy model is optimised, using the Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm to partion the input space. It is found that the neuro-fuzzy model predicts conflict with an accuracy of 80.1%. The neuro-fuzzy model is also incorporated into the hybrid machine learning method to suggest how the identified conflict cases can be avoided. The casual interpretation is then formulated by a linguistic approximation of the fuzzy rules extracted from the neuro-fuzzy model. The major finding in this work is that the interpretations drawn from both the neural network and the neuro-fuzzy model are consistent.",

            "abstract": "The authors take a new look at the relationship between regime type and deadly militarized conflict among pairs of states (dyads) in the international system. With the goal of describing the general functional form, they evaluate three perspectives: democratic peace, regime similarity and regime rationality. They employ both standard logistic regression (logit) and a recently developed machine learning technique, a support vector machine (SVM). Logit is dependent on assumptions that limit flexibility and make it difficult to discern the appropriate functional form. SVM estimation, on the other hand, is highly flexible and appears capable of discovering a relationship that is contingent on other variables in the model. SVM results indicate that regime similarity and joint democracy are important in most dyadic interactions. However, for the special but important case of the most dangerous dyads, regime rationality plays a role and the democratic peace effect is dominant. The results suggest that models of international conflict excluding distinct indicators for political similarity, joint democracy and joint autocracy may be misspecified. SVMs are an especially useful complement to conventional statistical methods.",

The results obtained from this granulization method are compared to static granulisation methods, namely, equal-width-bin and equal-frequency-bin partitioning. The results show that all of the proposed optimised methods produce higher forecasting accuracies than that of the two static methods and that genetic algorithm approach produced the highest accuracy. The rules generated from the rough set are linguistic and easy-to-interpret, but this does come at the expense of the accuracy lost in the discretisation process where the granularity of the variables is decreased.",

This thesis presents several methods to predict the conflict potential for failed nation states by comparing their social, economic, political, and military statistics with those in the past. This study uses the Brier scoring rule to evaluate the performances of these probability prediction methods. The study provides insights into situations where one method expects to outperform the others.",

            "title": "Using Case Studies to Expand Economic Models of Civil War",
            "abstract": "This article draws on a comparative case study design to refine formal-quantitative models of civil war, expanding them to highlight political processes that lead to civil war. It uses 21 case studies of civil war onset and avoidance to show the shortcomings in prominent rationalist models of civil war that rely heavily on economic variables. These shortcomings include measurement error, unit heterogeneity, model misspecification, and lack of clarity about causal mechanisms. Additionally, the greed/grievance distinction that underlies the economic models is misguided. This article analyzes civil war not as a discrete phenomenon, but rather as one phase in a cycle of violence. Economic models of civil war, however, rely on theories that cannot distinguish effectively between civil war and other forms of political violence. To explain civil war, we must explain why various and often conflicting micro-level motives combine to produce political violence with the characteristics that we attribute to civil war. If we cannot understand why we get civil war instead of other forms of organized political violence, then we do not understand civil war.Nicholas Sambanis thanks Keith Darden, Anna Grzymala-Busse, Jennifer Hochschild, Stathis Kalyvas, Bruce Russett, Jack Snyder, Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, and seminar participants at New York University and the University of Chicago for very useful comments, as well as Annalisa Zinn and Steve Shewfelt for excellent research assistance.

            "abstract": "Some prominent recent studies of civil war argue that greed, not grievance, is the primary motivating factor behind violence, basing their conclusions on a strong empirical association between primary commodity exports and civil war. This study contrasts alternative propositions that see need-, creed-, and governance-based explanations that are intimately related to the question of primary commodity dependence and conflict. Maximum likelihood analysis on approximately 138 countries over the entire post- Cold War period shows little support for neo-Malthusian claims. Abundant mineral wealth makes countries highly unstable, whereas scarcity of renewable resources is largely unrelated to civil conflict. A positive effect of population density on conflict does not seem to be conditioned by renewable resource scarcity. Ethnicity is related to conflict when society is moderately homogenous; a highly plural society faces less risk. Very slight political liberalization leads to conflict, but larger increases reduce the danger considerably, supporting the view that conflict is driven by opportunistic behaviour rather than by grievance. Increases in homogeneity among Islamic and Catholic populations make them riskier. Perhaps institutional factors relating to separation of church and state rather than competing creeds explain culture conflicts. Larger shares of both Christians and Muslims within countries make them safer, contrary to claims of natural antagonism between the two. Governance, proxied by the ratio of total trade to GDP, predicts peace strongly, an under-theorized area within the study of civil war. Trade's relationship to peace is robust to specification and sample size, supporting the findings of the State Failure Project. Greater attention should perhaps be paid to formal and informal institutional factors that create the synergy between private and public spaces for overcoming collective action problems of maintaining peace.",

They then test these predictions by performing a series of pooled time-series analyses covering all ethnic groups in the Minorities at Risk data set from 1985 to 1998. The authors find that democratization, federalism, and presidentialism may not be as problematic as some argue and that proportional representation tends to reduce severe ethnic violence.

            "abstract": "This article discusses the probability of increased communal conflict in African states due to the \u201cpolitical vulnerability\u201d of groups to climate change. From an initial examination of communal conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of conflict depends largely on the size and political importance of ethnic groups. Environmental issues can be catalysts to low-level conflict in marginalized communities, but the critical factor is the extent of political and economic marginalization. Small, politically insignificant ethnic groups experience most conflicts related to environmental pressures. This framework informs a prediction of where we should expect to see high levels of politically induced vulnerability and resultant intra- and intercommunal conflicts.",

This article takes issue with the `deterministic' view that climate change and resultant resource scarcities will have a direct impact on political violence. Rather, the effect of climate change on armed conflict is contingent on a number of political and social variables, which, if ignored by analysts, can lead to poor predictions about when and where conflict is likely. This article then discusses ways to improve research on the climate change\u2014conflict connection and outlines broad policy suggestions for dealing with this potential problem. Scholars must communicate their findings with the policy community in order to come up with prudent solutions to this problem, while countering unnecessary rhetoric on both sides of the debate.",

This poster demonstrates the application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to the prediction of conflict. In order to address the rare events problem, I use an ensemble of classifiers built on subsets of the training data. These subsets include all positive cases, and a random selection of negative ones. Although I focus primarily on decision tree learning, the proposed method can be used in conjunction with different classification algorithms in order to improve the prediction of conflict onset.",

            "title": "Trends and Triggers: Climate Change and Civil Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa",
            "abstract": "The conventional discourse relating climate change to human security focuses on long-term trends in temperature and precipitation that define ecosystems and their subsequent impact on access to renewable natural resources. Because these changes occur over long time periods, however, existing operationalizations of resource scarcity, such as measures of land degradation and desertification, are mostly stationary, and as such perform poorly in capturing the proximate factors that may \"trigger\" conflict. We argue that this conventional discourse may overlook one of the key findings emanating from the global climate models on which these predictions are based: increased variance around mean temperatures and precipitation. We approach this question from two perspectives. First, we estimate the impact of both long-term trends in climate (operationalized as climate zones and land degradation) and short-term climatic variance (operationalized as the lagged percent change in annual rainfall) on the onset of civil conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that both operationalizations have a significant impact on the likelihood of conflict onset. More temperate, fertile climates are associated with a decreased likelihood of conflict. Moreover, negative changes in rainfall are associated with an increased likelihood of conflict in the following year. However, an analysis of marginal effects leads us to conclude that interannual variability matters more than the specter of changes in overall means and climate, which take place over long periods of time. Second, we assess the outlook for the future based on our analysis of predicted changes in precipitation means and variance generated by NCARPCM3, a coupled global circulation model (CGCM) of precipitation over the period 1980-2059. We find that future total annual precipitation shows a positive linear trend, whereas no statistically significant trend is found in intra-annual or interannual variance, suggesting that monsoon patterns in Africa are unlikely to be affected by expected changes in climate. This leads us to conclude that strategies for managing risks to human security must focus on breaking the direct dependence of subsistence agriculturalists on rainfall as a source of crop water, even as the variability of access to this resource is not predicted to increase in the future.

            "abstract": "This study used logistic regression to determine whether there is a significant difference in pedestrian\u2013vehicle interaction severity at side street green and exclusive phase pedestrian signals, and to evaluate whether waiting- and crossing times are useful predictors of pedestrian\u2013vehicle conflict. To do this, data related to the physical characteristics of each intersection and to the crossing experience of every pedestrian were gathered at 32 signalized intersections in Connecticut. At each intersection, conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles were classified into four distinct severity levels: undisturbed passage, potential conflict, minor conflict, and serious conflict. After interpreting the results of six different logistic regression refinements, it was determined that waiting time, crossing time, the number of lanes, annual average daily traffic, pedestrian compliance, phasing, and the presence of crosswalks were all useful predictors. Based on the results of this analysis, low wait time and crossing time values were associated with a decrease in the odds of a conflict. It was also determined that exclusive phase signals reduced the odds of a conflict by 85%. Future research should investigate variables associated with different land development patterns and demographic information. Along with this, the crossing experience of individuals who do not comply with pedestrian signals should also be evaluated.",

            "abstract": "There is an active debate regarding the influence that climate has on the risk of armed conflict, which stems from challenges in assembling unbiased datasets, competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of climate influence, and the difficulty of disentangling direct and indirect climate effects. We use gridded historical non-state conflict records, satellite data, and land surface models in a structural equation modeling approach to uncover the direct and indirect effects of climate on violent conflicts in Africa and the Middle East (ME). We show that climate\u2013conflict linkages in these regions are more complex than previously suggested, with multiple mechanisms at work. Warm temperatures and low rainfall direct effects on conflict risk were stronger than indirect effects through food and water supplies. Warming increases the risk of violence in Africa but unexpectedly decreases this risk in the ME. Furthermore, at the country level, warming decreases the risk of violence in most West African countries. Overall, we find a non-linear response of conflict to warming across countries that depends on the local temperature conditions. We further show that magnitude and sign of the effects largely depend on the scale of analysis and geographical context. These results imply that extreme caution should be exerted when attempting to explain or project local climate\u2013conflict relationships based on a single, generalized theory.",

            "title": "Civil conflict sensitivity to growing-season drought",
            "abstract": "Significance Understanding the conflict potential of drought is critical for dealing effectively with the societal implications of climate change. Using new georeferenced ethnicity and conflict data for Asia and Africa since 1989, we present an actor-oriented analysis of growing-season drought and conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Results from naive models common in previous research suggest that drought generally has little impact. However, context-sensitive models accounting for the groups\u2019 level of vulnerability reveal that drought can contribute to sustaining conflict, especially for agriculturally dependent groups and politically excluded groups in very poor countries. These results suggest a reciprocal nature\u2013society interaction in which violent conflict and environmental shock constitute a vicious circle, each phenomenon increasing the group\u2019s vulnerability to the other. To date, the research community has failed to reach a consensus on the nature and significance of the relationship between climate variability and armed conflict. We argue that progress has been hampered by insufficient attention paid to the context in which droughts and other climatic extremes may increase the risk of violent mobilization. Addressing this shortcoming, this study presents an actor-oriented analysis of the drought\u2013conflict relationship, focusing specifically on politically relevant ethnic groups and their sensitivity to growing-season drought under various political and socioeconomic contexts. To this end, we draw on new conflict event data that cover Asia and Africa, 1989\u20132014, updated spatial ethnic settlement data, and remote sensing data on agricultural land use. Our procedure allows quantifying, for each ethnic group, drought conditions during the growing season of the locally dominant crop. A comprehensive set of multilevel mixed effects models that account for the groups\u2019 livelihood, economic, and political vulnerabilities reveals that a drought under most conditions has little effect on the short-term risk that a group challenges the state by military means. However, for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries, a local drought is found to increase the likelihood of sustained violence. We interpret this as evidence of the reciprocal relationship between drought and conflict, whereby each phenomenon makes a group more vulnerable to the other.",

            "title": "Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Conflict",
            "abstract": "Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question. Climate and conflict across spatial scales. Evidence that temperature influences the risk of modern human conflict: (A) local violence in 1\u00b0 grid cells, (B) civil war in countries, and (C) civil conflict risk in the tropics. The map depicts regions of analysis corresponding to nonparametric watercolor regressions in (A) to (C). The color intensity in (A) to (C) indicates the level of certainty in the regression line. Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or \u201cnatural experiments\u201d; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions. Results Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate\u2019s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant (P < 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates). Discussion We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades\u2014with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050\u2014amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries. Climate and Conflict Knowledge silos can hinder attempts to explore questions of interest across many disciplines. Hsiang et al. (p. 1235367, published online 1 August) provide a meta-analysis of data from disciplines as disparate as archaeology and psychology to examine the relation between climate and conflict. Overall, warmer temperatures or extremes of rainfall can be causally associated with changes in interpersonal violence and in civil war. Across disciplinary boundaries, recently published evidence links climate change to increased violent conflict. A rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate\u2019s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1\u03c3) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2\u03c3 to 4\u03c3 by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.",

            "abstract": "The article predicts changes in global and regional incidences of armed conflict for the 2010\u20132050 period. The predictions are based on a dynamic multinomial logit model estimation on a 1970\u20132009 cross-sectional data set of changes between no armed conflict, minor conflict, and major conflict. Core exogenous predictors are population size, infant mortality rates, demographic composition, education levels, oil dependence, ethnic cleavages, and neighborhood characteristics. Predictions are obtained through simulating the behavior of the conflict variable implied by the estimates from this model. We use projections for the 2011\u20132050 period for the predictors from the UN World Population Prospects and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. We treat conflicts, recent conflict history, and neighboring conflicts as endogenous variables. Out-of-sample validation of predictions for 2007\u20132009 (based on estimates for the 1970\u20132000 period) indicates that the model predicts well, with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.937. Using a p > .30 threshold for positive prediction, the true positive rate 7\u20139 years into the future is 0.79 and the False Positive Rate 0.085. We predict a continued decline in the proportion of the world's countries that have internal armed conflict, from about 15% in 2009 to 7% in 2050. The decline is particularly strong in the Western Asia and North Africa region and less clear in Africa south of Sahara. The remaining conflict countries will increasingly be concentrated in East, Central, and Southern Africa and in East and South Asia.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies concerning the possible relationship between climate trends and the risks of violent conflict have yielded contradictory results, partly because of choices of conflict measures and modeling design. In this study, we examine climate\u2013conflict relationships using a geographically disaggregated approach. We consider the effects of climate change to be both local and national in character, and we use a conflict database that contains 16,359 individual geolocated violent events for East Africa from 1990 to 2009. Unlike previous studies that relied exclusively on political and economic controls, we analyze the many geographical factors that have been shown to be important in understanding the distribution and causes of violence while also considering yearly and country fixed effects. For our main climate indicators at gridded 1\u00b0 resolution (\u223c100 km), wetter deviations from the precipitation norms decrease the risk of violence, whereas drier and normal periods show no effects. The relationship between temperature and conflict shows that much warmer than normal temperatures raise the risk of violence, whereas average and cooler temperatures have no effect. These precipitation and temperature effects are statistically significant but have modest influence in terms of predictive power in a model with political, economic, and physical geographic predictors. Large variations in the climate\u2013conflict relationships are evident between the nine countries of the study region and across time periods.",

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Abstract One way of improving forecasts is through better data. We explore how much we can improve predictions of conflict violence by introducing data reflecting third-party efforts to manage violence. By leveraging new sub-national data on all UN peacekeeping deployments in Africa, 1994\u20132020, from the Geocoded Peacekeeping (Geo-PKO) dataset, we predict changes in violence at the local level. The advantage of data on peacekeeping deployments is that these vary over time and space, as opposed to many structural variables commonly used. We present two peacekeeping models that contain several local peacekeeping features, each with a separate set of additional variables that form the respective benchmark. The mean errors of our predictions only improve marginally. However, comparing observed and predicted changes in violence, the peacekeeping features improve our ability to identify the correct sign of the change. These results are particularly strong when we limit the sample to countries that have seen peacekeeping deployments. For an ambitious forecasting project, like ViEWS, it may thus be highly relevant to incorporate fine-grained and frequently updated data on peacekeeping troops.",

            "abstract": "Research on the relationship between civil conflict and repression has led to one conclusion\u2014the law-like finding that states respond to internal challengers with repression\u2014and one puzzle with competing hypotheses\u2014whether state repression escalates civil conflict or not. Studies of repression\u2019s effect on conflict dynamics have been limited to case studies and subnational designs, which limits the external validity of the arguments. Studies of conflict\u2019s effect on repression have treated conflict as a control variable without taking into account the inherent endogeneity between internal conflict and state repression. This article contributes by providing a general, cross-national study of repression\u2019s effect on conflict, and vice versa, for external validity. Results of simultaneous equation models demonstrate that both directions of the relationship between state repression and conflict are positive and significant\u2014suggesting a cyclical relationship\u2014while single equation models with a lag structure establish that the effect of repression on conflict is greater than the reverse.",

            "abstract": "Social unrest is endemic in many societies, and recent news has drawn attention to happenings in Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Civilian populations mobilize, sometimes spontaneously and sometimes in an organized manner, to raise awareness of key issues or to demand changes in governing or other organizational structures. It is of key interest to social scientists and policy makers to forecast civil unrest using indicators observed on media such as Twitter, news, and blogs. We present an event forecasting model using a notion of activity cascades in Twitter (proposed by Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2011) to predict the occurrence of protests in three countries of Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. The basic assumption is that the emergence of a suitably detected activity cascade is a precursor or a surrogate to a real protest event that will happen \u201con the ground.\u201d Our model supports the theoretical characterization of large cascades using spectral properties and uses properties of detected cascades to forecast events. Experimental results on many datasets, including the recent June 2013 protests in Brazil, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "title": "Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer than Others?",
            "abstract": "Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have anti-colonial wars. By contrast, \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 wars that typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group are on average quite long-lived. So are conflicts in which a rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium, diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to long-running, destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible explanation. In the model, regional autonomy deals may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine the government\u2019s ability to commit. The commitment problem binds harder when the center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as in the case of contraband funding.",

The text features are generated from over 3.5 million newspaper articles using a so\u2010called topic\u2010model. We show that the combined model relies to a large extent on conflict dynamics, but that text is able to contribute meaningfully to the prediction of rare outbreaks of violence in previously peaceful countries.

            "title": "Community Interaction and Conflict on the Web",
            "abstract": "Users organize themselves into communities on web platforms. These communities can interact with one another, often leading to conflicts and toxic interactions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactions between communities and how they impact users. Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities on Reddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negative sentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend to be initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start 74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly active community members, they are carried out by significantly less active members. We find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where users primarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term, conflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in the targeted communities. Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating the negative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement between attackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict will occur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user, community, and text features. This model can be used to create an early-warning system for community moderators to prevent conflicts. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of community interactions and conflict, and paves the way towards healthier online communities.",

Countries act as rational agents concerned with both consumption and the public bad of a war. In the first period both countries can either consume or build arms, whereas in the second period there can be either the threat or the use of force to reallocate resources. If both countries are fully informed, then there will be no war but rather a voluntary redistribution of resources. In a situation of asymmetric information, however, in which one country is fully informed and the other is not, a war can occur if the uninformed country uses a separating equilibrium strategy, precommitting itself to a positive probability of war in order to prevent bluffing by the informed country.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT \u201cContentious politics\u201d has become the main label to define a wide range of previously separated fields of research encompassing topics such as collective action, radicalization, armed insurgencies, and terrorism. Over the past two decades, scholars have tried to bring these various strands together into a unified field of study. In so doing, they have developed a methodology to isolate and analyze the common social and cognitive mechanisms underlying several diverse historical phenomena such as \u201cinsurgencies,\u201d \u201crevolutions,\u201d \u201cradicalization,\u201d or \u201cterrorism.\u201d A multidisciplinary approach was adopted open to contributions from diverse fields such as economics, sociology, and psychology. The aim of this paper is to add to the multidisciplinarity of the field of Contentious Politics (CP) and introduce the instruments of Agent-Based Modeling and network game-theory to the study of some fundamental mechanisms analyzed within this literature. In particular, the model presented in this paper describes the dynamics of one process, here defined as \u201cthe radicalization of politics,\u201d and its main underlying mechanisms. Their mechanics are analyzed in diverse social contexts differentiated by the values of four parameters: the extent of repression, inequality, social tolerance, and interconnectivity. The model can be used to explain the basic dynamics underlying different phenomena such as the development of radicalization, populism, and popular rebellions. In the final part, different societies characterized by diverse values of the aforementioned four parameters are tested through Python simulations, thereby offering an overview of the different outcomes that the mechanics of our model can shape according to the contexts in which they operate.",

            "abstract": "Earlier research that reports a correlational pattern between climate anomalies and violent conflict routinely refers to drought-induced agricultural shocks and adverse economic spillover effects as a key causal mechanism linking the two phenomena. Comparing half a century of statistics on climate variability, food production, and political violence across Sub-Saharan Africa, this study offers the most precise and theoretically consistent empirical assessment to date of the purported indirect relationship. The analysis reveals a robust link between weather patterns and food production where more rainfall generally is associated with higher yields. However, the second step in the causal model is not supported; agricultural output and violent conflict are only weakly and inconsistently connected, even in the specific contexts where production shocks are believed to have particularly devastating social consequences. Although this null result could, in theory, be fully compatible with recent reports of food price-related riots, it suggests that the wider socioeconomic and political context is much more important than drought and crop failures in explaining violent conflict in contemporary Africa.",

Using count regression techniques, household survey data and sub-national conflict data, we find a negative correlation between the number of antenatal care visits and incidents of conflict-related violence within a respondent's village development committee. Specifically, we find that under high-intensity conflict conditions women receive between 0.3 and 1.5 fewer antenatal care check-ups. These findings imply that maternal health care utilization is partially determined by characteristics of the social environment (e.g. political instability) and suggest health care providers need to revise maternal health strategies in conflict-affected areas. Strategies may include decentralization of services, maintaining neutrality among factions, strengthening community-based health services and developing mobile clinics.",

            "abstract": "Modern conflicts are characterized by an ever increasing use of information and sensing technology, resulting in vast amounts of high resolution data. Modelling and prediction of conflict, however, remain challenging tasks due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the data typically available. Here we propose the use of dynamic spatiotemporal modelling tools for the identification of complex underlying processes in conflict, such as diffusion, relocation, heterogeneous escalation, and volatility. Using ideas from statistics, signal processing, and ecology, we provide a predictive framework able to assimilate data and give confidence estimates on the predictions. We demonstrate our methods on the WikiLeaks Afghan War Diary. Our results show that the approach allows deeper insights into conflict dynamics and allows a strikingly statistically accurate forward prediction of armed opposition group activity in 2010, based solely on data from previous years.",

Agents are modeled from multi-disciplinary perspectives and their behavioral strategies are evolved over time via collective co-evolution and independent learning. Experimental results reveal the onset of fascinating global emergent phenomenon as well as interesting patterns of group movement and behavioral development. Analysis of the results provides new insights into the intricate behavioral dynamics that arises in civil upheavals. Collectively, EMAS serves as a vehicle to facilitate the behavioral development of autonomous agents as well as a platform to verify the effectiveness of various violence management policies which is paramount to the mitigation of casualties.",

            "abstract": "In 1996, more than half of the states considered legislation banning same-sex marriages. This article examines these events as a geographic expansion of the scope of the conflict rather than as traditional state-centered policy innovation. I argue that the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans was determined by the organized efforts of advocacy coalitions and internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion or communication among policy experts. I use state-level data collected from activists, media accounts, and official sources to establish the organized efforts to ban same-sex marriage. I then develop and empirically test a model of policy diffusion to predict both state consideration and adoption of policies banning same-sex marriage. The findings suggest that the diffusion of these policies is best explained by the presence of an organized national campaign by conservative religious groups, the local resources of interest groups, and other internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion patterns. I also find that the influence of state characteristics may vary during the policymaking process.",

            "abstract": "Young populations, and particularly young males, have been attributed a proclivity to aggression and unrest that puts societies at risk. Theories about the dangers of a demographic \u2018youth bulge\u2019 inform public and policy debates about the predictors of violent conflict, as evidenced most recently in the World Bank's World Development Report for 2007. This paper assesses the validity and utility of claims linking youth bulges to civil conflicts by reviewing different literatures concerning naturalist ideas of young humans' innate aggression and cognitive incompetence as well as environmentalist ideas of environmental stimuli, processes of socialisation, and the dialectical relationship of structural conditions and human agency. This review finds that the moral panic propagated by youth bulge theorists is too often based on only one form of influence on human development and action, whether an aspect of environment, personal experience, or individual traits. A more cogent analysis must integrate the highly complex and dynamic processes involved in cognition and behaviour and aim to develop theories that take account of the social power, ideational and structural forms, and emotional and cognitive processes that young people experience and draw on in times of war.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the question of what form a revolutionary uprising will take \u2013 armed or unarmed \u2013 has been raised more often. This is because, as shown by numerous studies, revolutionary nonviolence can explain why an uprising fails or succeeds to lead to democracy. In the recent decades the likelihood of revolution being nonviolent appears to have significantly increase d, but it is still not clear why this tendency is observe d. Moreover, there are only a few quantitative cross-national studies on this topi c, in which the authors tried to explain the apparent pattern. However, none of them considered political factors separately. This article tests the hypothesis that a countr y\u2019s level of democracy can inhibit the armed revolutionary violence. By applying logistic regression to the NAVCO database, the authors analyze more than 400 revolutionary episodes and conclude tha t, in genera l, the more democratic the political system, the more likely the revolution take an unarmed form. Nevertheless, various revolutionary events could be of a rather different natur e, and it is further shown that the level of democracy matters only for sociopolitical revolution s, while for ethno-separatist revo - lutions it does not play a significant role.",

            "abstract": "Predictive models, which includes forecasting models, are used to study all types of conflict and political violence, including civil wars, international conflict, terrorism, genocide, and protests. These models are defined as those where the researcher explicitly values predictive performance when building and analyzing the model. This is different from inferential models, where the researcher values the accurate operationalization of a theory, and experimental or quasi-experimental designs where the focus is on the estimation of a causal effect. Researchers employ preditive models to guide policy, to assess the importance of variables, to test and compare theories, and for the development of research methods. In addition to these practical applications, there are more fundamental arguments, rooted in the philosophy of science, as to why these models should be used to advance conflict research. Their use has led to numerous substantive findings. For example, while inferential models largely support the democratic peace hypothesis, predictive models have shown mixed results and have been used to refine the scope of the argument. Among the more robust findings are the presence of nonlinear relationships and the importance of dependencies in all types of conflict data. These findings have implications for how researchers model conflict processes. As predictive models become more common and more integrated into the study of conflict, it is important that researchers understand their underlying components to use them appropriately.",

Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models.

            "abstract": "In this research, we focused on armed conflicts and related violence. The study reviewed the use of machine learning to predict the likelihood of conflict escalation and the role of conditioning factors. The results showed that machine learning and predictive models could help identify conflict-prone locations and geospatial factors contributing to conflict escalation. The study found 46 relevant papers and emphasized the importance of considering unique predictors and conditioning factors for each conflict. It was found that the conflict susceptibility of a region is influenced principally by its socioeconomic conditions and its political/governance factors. We concluded that machine learning has the potential to be a valuable tool in conflict analysis and, therefore, it can be an asset in conflict mitigation and prevention, but the accuracy of the models depends on data quality and the careful selection of conditioning factors. Future research should aim to refine the methodology for more accurate prediction of the models.",

            "abstract": "Many countries that face forced migrant inflows refuse to admit these uprooted people premised on negative externalities such as increased insecurity associated with refugee presence. Also, the academic literature on civil conflict identified refugee movements as a factor contributing to the regional clustering of war. Case-based evidence suggests that refugees can disturb the ethnic setup in the country of asylum and thereby trigger instability. To enhance the yet limited systematic understanding of the role of refugees in violent conflicts, this study examines the linkage between forced migrants, transnational connections, and ethnic civil conflict in the country of asylum with a large-N analysis, 1975\u20132013, arguing that ethnic power politics in the asylum state are determinant for intrastate conflict onset after a refugee influx. Statistical analysis finds that groups are particularly prone to conflict if they are excluded from governmental power and simultaneously host ethnic kin refugees, because a co-ethnic refugee influx enlarges the demographic and political leverage of the kin group, possibly resulting in clashes with other groups in the country. Hence, refugees alone do not consistently influence armed violence \u2013 only in combination with political tensions in the receiving country. Therefore, host governments should pursue inclusionary policies towards their population, to prevent dangerous instability, instead of closing borders or blaming refugees for domestic problems.",

We consider whether the spatial pattern of intrastate conflict simply stems from a similar distribution of relevant country attributes or whether conflicts indeed constitute a threat to other proximate states. Our results strongly suggest that there is a genuine neighborhood effect of armed conflict, over and beyond what individual country characteristics can account for. We then examine whether the risk of contagion depends on the degree of exposure to proximate conflicts. Contrary to common expectations, this appears not to be the case. Rather, we find that conflict is more likely when there are ethnic ties to groups in a neighboring conflict and that contagion is primarily a feature of separatist conflicts. This suggests that transnational ethnic linkages constitute a central mechanism of conflict contagion.",

            "abstract": "This article is founded on the assumption that cluster analysis can be used to complement regressionbased techniques to obtain further improvement in systematic understanding of the nexus of politics, economics, and conflict. It assumes such variables form part of a yet to be understood, non-linear, timedependent interactive system. Cluster analysis is used to classify entities into groups and aims toward explanations based on characteristics cutting across the objects in which they are embedded; thus, the analysis seeks a more compelling account of the complex linkages between and among economic, political, and conflict-related variables. Cross-sectional data for 1967, 1974, 1981, 1988, and 1995 from the Dataset on National Attributes is used in the cluster analysis. The data analysis identifies clusters of states based on a range of characteristics. As expected within a time-dependent system, there is evidence of consistent clustering of countries within and across years, along with evidence of change. Several clusters, such as the advanced states, are very stable and indicate patterns that should be explored further with regression analysis.",

            "title": "Population and Security: How Demographic Change Can Lead to Violent Conflict",
            "abstract": "\"While the marked decrease in population growth in many countries and regions is good news for those concerned about global population, it offers no clear relief for concerns about the security implications of population change.\" As we cross into the new century, the world seems finally to have turned the corner on population growth. A combination of increased education for women, national and international support for policies of population planning and the spread of economic development and accompanying movement along the demographic transition frontier have led to falling population growth rates around the world. Whether among the behemoths--China and India--or among the smaller but rapidly growing nations--such as Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Malawi--population growth rates have dropped dramatically in the last decade. (1) Yet while population growth rates have dropped around the world, they remain high in some areas. In particular, many nations in the Middle East, southeast Asia and central and northern Africa still are growing at nearly 3 percent per year, a growth rate that leads to a doubling of population in approximately 25 years. Moreover, although in most countries the rate of population growth has slowed, the absolute number of people being added to the world's population has not; the large number of women of childbearing age in the developing world, carrying the momentum of past population growth, ensure that even while growth rates fall as a percentage of the existing population, the number of new births each year continues to rise. For example, although China's growth rate has fallen to 1.0 percent per year, China will still grow by 10 to 11 million people per year for the next 15 years. The world as a whole will add roughly 80 million people per year, or another 960 million (that is, another India) in the next dozen years. (2) DEMOGRAPHY AND SECURITY: KEY FINDINGS After nearly three decades of debate and analysis, stemming from Myron Weiner's (1971) path-breaking study, scholars are beginning to develop much clearer answers to the complex questions regarding how population changes affect security concerns. Those answers can be summarized briefly in the following propositions, each of which we shall treat in greater detail below: 1) While population growth often brings degradation of forests, water resources, arable land and other local resources, such environmental degradation is not a major or pervasive cause of international wars, ethnic wars or revolutionary conflicts. Such degradation often brings misery, yet such misery does not generally trigger the elite alienation and opposition to the government necessary for large-scale violence to occur. 2) Population growth can give rise to conflicts over increasingly scarce resources, such as farmland, if those conflicts involve elites seeking to take resources from popular groups, or competition between elite factions for control of those resources. However, what determines whether violent conflict arises are the relationships among popular groups, elites and the state, and particularly whether the state has the capacity to channel and moderate elite conflicts. Only where elite conflicts or popular resistance to elite actions overwhelm weak states do major conflicts arise. 3) While overall population growth and population density do not generally predict political risks, a number of distinct kinds of demographic changes--rapid growth in the labor force in slow-growing economies, a rapid increase in educated youth aspiring to elite positions when such positions are scarce, unequal population growth rates between different ethnic groups, urbanization that exceeds employment growth and migrations that change the local balance among major ethnic groups--do appear to increase the risks of violent internal political and ethnic conflicts. In addition, there is some evidence that countries with larger populations have greater risks of both armed conflict and state repression. \u2026",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article addresses the discrepancy between the explanation and the prediction of political violence through the development of different models that approximate the decision-making on war and peace. Borrowing from the crisis bargaining literature, the prediction models particularly consider the situational attributes through which players can challenge the status quo. We distinguish between direct and indirect proxies of a weakening of the status quo and show that adding decision-making data can improve the accuracy of cross-sectional forecasting models. The study, which demonstrates the increased conflict risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thus another development upsetting the status quo, discusses the usefulness of decision-making forecasts through various case study illustrations. Este art\u00edculo aborda la discrepancia entre la explicaci\u00f3n y la predicci\u00f3n de la violencia pol\u00edtica mediante la elaboraci\u00f3n de diversos modelos que se acercan a la toma de decisiones sobre la guerra y la paz. Inspirados en las publicaciones sobre negociaciones de crisis, los modelos de predicci\u00f3n consideran, en particular, las caracter\u00edsticas situacionales a trav\u00e9s de las cuales las piezas claves pueden desafiar el statu quo. Distinguimos entre indicadores directos e indirectos de un debilitamiento del statu quo y demostramos que la incorporaci\u00f3n de datos sobre la toma de decisiones puede mejorar la precisi\u00f3n de los modelos de previsi\u00f3n transversal. El estudio, que demuestra el aumento del riesgo de conflicto durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 y, por lo tanto, otro acontecimiento que altera el statu quo, analiza la utilidad de las previsiones para la toma de decisiones mediante diferentes ejemplos de casos pr\u00e1cticos. Cet article aborde la divergence entre l\u2019explication et la pr\u00e9diction de la violence politique par le d\u00e9veloppement de diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les qui permettent une estimation des prises de d\u00e9cisions sur la guerre et la paix. S\u2019inspirant de la litt\u00e9rature sur les n\u00e9gociations de crises les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9diction prennent en particulier en compte les attributs situationnels par lesquels les acteurs peuvent remettre en question le statu quo. Nous distinguons les variables directes des variables indirectes de l\u2019affaiblissement du statu quo et montrons que l\u2019ajout de donn\u00e9es sur les prises de d\u00e9cisions peut am\u00e9liorer la pr\u00e9cision des mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9vision transversaux.

            "title": "Predicting escalating and de-escalating violence in Africa using Markov models",
            "abstract": "Abstract This contribution to the ViEWS prediction competition 2020 proposes using Markov modeling to model the change in the logarithm of battle-related deaths between two points in time in a country. The predictions are made using two ensembles of observed and hidden Markov models, where the covariate sets for the ensembles are drawn from the ViEWS country month constituent models. The weights for the individual models in the ensembles were obtained using a genetic algorithm optimizing the fit on the TADDA-score in a calibration set. The weighted ensembles of visible and hidden Markov models outperform the ViEWS prediction competition benchmark models on the TADDA score in the test period of January 2017 to December 2019 for all time steps. Forecasts until March 2021 predict increased violence primarily in Algeria, Libya, Tchad, Niger, and Angola, and decreased or unchanged levels of violence in most of the remaining countries in Africa. An analysis of the model weights in the ensembles shows that the conflict history constituent model provided by ViEWS was dominant in the ensembles. Esta contribuci\u00f3n a la competencia de predicciones 2020 del Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) propone utilizar la modelizaci\u00f3n de M\u00e1rkov para elaborar un modelo del cambio en el logaritmo de las muertes relacionadas con batallas entre dos puntos temporales en un pa\u00eds. Las predicciones se elaboran con dos conjuntos de modelos observados y ocultos de M\u00e1rkov, en los que los grupos de covariables de los conjuntos se obtienen de los modelos constituyentes mensuales de los pa\u00edses del ViEWS. La relevancia de los modelos individuales en los conjuntos se obtuvo mediante un algoritmo gen\u00e9tico que optimiza el ajuste de la puntuaci\u00f3n TADDA en un grupo de calibraci\u00f3n. Los conjuntos ponderados de los modelos visibles y ocultos de M\u00e1rkov superan los modelos de referencia de la competencia de predicciones del ViEWS en relaci\u00f3n con la puntuaci\u00f3n TADDA (Distancia absoluta orientada con aumento de direcci\u00f3n) en el per\u00edodo de prueba de enero de 2017 a diciembre de 2019 para todos los intervalos de tiempo. Las predicciones hasta marzo de 2021 pronostican un aumento en la violencia principalmente en Argelia, Libia, Chad, N\u00edger y Angola, y niveles de violencia disminuidos o sin variaciones en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses restantes en \u00c1frica. Un an\u00e1lisis de la relevancia de los modelos en los conjuntos demuestra que los modelos constituyentes de la historia de conflictos que proporciona el ViEWS fueron dominantes en dichos conjuntos. Cette contribution au concours de pr\u00e9vision ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) 2020 propose d\u2019utiliser la mod\u00e9lisation de Markov pour mod\u00e9liser l\u2019\u00e9volution du logarithme des d\u00e9c\u00e8s li\u00e9s aux conflits entre deux moments de l\u2019histoire d\u2019un pays. Les pr\u00e9dictions sont effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019aide de deux ensembles de mod\u00e8les de Markov cach\u00e9s et de mod\u00e8les de Markov observ\u00e9s, et les jeux de covariables de ces ensembles sont tir\u00e9s des mod\u00e8les constituants par mois et pays du syst\u00e8me ViEWS. Les pond\u00e9rations des mod\u00e8les individuels des ensembles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues en utilisant un algorithme g\u00e9n\u00e9tique optimisant l\u2019ajustement sur le score TADDA (Distance absolue cibl\u00e9e avec augmentation de direction) dans un jeu de calibration. Les ensembles pond\u00e9r\u00e9s de mod\u00e8les de Markov visibles et cach\u00e9s sont plus performants que les mod\u00e8les de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS pour ce qui est du score TADDA de la p\u00e9riode de test de janvier 2017 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2019, et ce pour tous les pas de temps. Les pr\u00e9visions jusqu\u2019\u00e0 mars 2021 ont permis de pr\u00e9dire une augmentation de la violence principalement en Alg\u00e9rie, en Libye, au Tchad, au Niger et en Angola, et une diminution ou un maintien des niveaux de violence dans la plupart des autres pays d\u2019Afrique. Une analyse des pond\u00e9rations des mod\u00e8les dans les ensembles montre que le mod\u00e8le constituant bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019histoire des conflits fourni par ViEWS serait dominant dans les ensembles.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The 2020 Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) Prediction Competition challenged participants to produce predictive models of violent political conflict at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper presents a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network capable of forecasting the log change in battle-related deaths resulting from state-based armed conflict at the PRIO-GRID cell-month level. The ConvLSTM outperforms the benchmark model provided by the ViEWS team and performs comparably to the best models submitted to the competition. In addition to providing a technical description of the ConvLSTM, I evaluate the model\u2019s out-of-sample performance and interrogate a selection of interesting model forecasts. I find that the model relies heavily on lagged levels of battle-related fatalities to forecast future decreases in violence. The model struggles to forecast escalations in violence and tends to underpredict the magnitude of escalation while overpredicting the spatial spread of escalation. El concurso de predicciones del sistema de alerta temprana sobre la violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) de 2020 desafi\u00f3 a los participantes a producir modelos predictivos de conflictos pol\u00edticos violentos a altas resoluciones espaciales y temporales. Este documento presenta una red neuronal recurrente de memoria convolucional a corto y largo plazo (convolutional long short-term memory, ConvLSTM) capaz de predecir el cambio de registro en las muertes relacionadas con las batallas como resultado de los conflictos armados de estado a nivel de mes de celda de PRIO-GRID. La ConvLSTM supera el modelo de referencia proporcionado por el equipo de ViEWS y funciona de manera similar a los mejores modelos presentados en el concurso. Adem\u00e1s de proporcionar una descripci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica de la ConvLSTM, analizo el rendimiento del modelo fuera de la muestra y cuestiono una serie de interesantes previsiones del modelo. Considero que el modelo se basa, principalmente, en niveles rezagados de v\u00edctimas mortales a causa de las batallas para predecir las futuras disminuciones de la violencia. El modelo se esfuerza por predecir las escaladas de la violencia y tiende a predecir con poca frecuencia la magnitud de la escalada, pero con m\u00e1s frecuencia la propagaci\u00f3n espacial de esta.

            "title": "The role of governmental weapons procurements in forecasting monthly fatalities in intrastate conflicts: A semiparametric hierarchical hurdle model",
            "abstract": "Abstract Accurate and interpretable forecasting models predicting spatially and temporally fine-grained changes in the numbers of intrastate conflict casualties are of crucial importance for policymakers and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Using a count data approach, we propose a hierarchical hurdle regression model to address the corresponding prediction challenge at the monthly PRIO-grid level. More precisely, we model the intensity of local armed conflict at a specific point in time as a three-stage process. Stages one and two of our approach estimate whether we will observe any casualties at the country- and grid-cell-level, respectively, while stage three applies a regression model for truncated data to predict the number of such fatalities conditional upon the previous two stages. Within this modeling framework, we focus on the role of governmental arms imports as a processual factor allowing governments to intensify or deter from fighting. We further argue that a grid cell\u2019s geographic remoteness is bound to moderate the effects of these military buildups. Out-of-sample predictions corroborate the effectiveness of our parsimonious and theory-driven model, which enables full transparency combined with accuracy in the forecasting process. Los modelos de previsi\u00f3n precisos e interpretables que predicen los cambios a nivel espacial y temporal en la cantidad de v\u00edctimas de los conflictos intraestatales son de vital importancia para los responsables pol\u00edticos y las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) internacionales. Utilizando un enfoque de datos de recuento, proponemos un modelo de regresi\u00f3n Hurdle jer\u00e1rquico para abordar el correspondiente reto de predicci\u00f3n a nivel mensual de PRIO-GRID. M\u00e1s concretamente, modelamos la intensidad del conflicto armado local en un momento determinado como un proceso de tres etapas. Las etapas uno y dos de nuestro enfoque estiman si observaremos alguna v\u00edctima a nivel de pa\u00eds y de celda de la red, respectivamente, mientras que la etapa tres aplica un modelo de regresi\u00f3n para datos truncados con el prop\u00f3sito de predecir la cantidad potencial de dichas v\u00edctimas mortales en funci\u00f3n de las dos etapas anteriores. Dentro de este marco de modelizaci\u00f3n, nos centramos en el rol de las importaciones de armas por parte de los gobiernos como un factor de proceso que permite a los gobiernos intensificar o impedir los enfrentamientos. Adem\u00e1s, sostenemos que la lejan\u00eda geogr\u00e1fica de una c\u00e9lula de la red est\u00e1 destinada a moderar los efectos de estas concentraciones militares. Las predicciones fuera de la muestra corroboran la eficacia de nuestro modelo parsimonioso y basado en la teor\u00eda, que permite una transparencia total combinada con precisi\u00f3n en el proceso de previsi\u00f3n. Les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9vision pr\u00e9cis et interpr\u00e9tables, qui permettent de pr\u00e9dire spatialement et temporellement les d\u00e9tails des changements dans les nombres de victimes de conflits intra-\u00e9tatiques, sont d\u2019une importance cruciale pour les d\u00e9cideurs politiques et les organizations non gouvernementales (ONG) internationales. Nous adoptons une approche par donn\u00e9es de comptage et nous proposons un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gression hi\u00e9rarchique \u00e0 obstacle (hurdle) pour relever le d\u00e9fi de la pr\u00e9diction correspondante au niveau de la grille mensuelle du PRIO (Peace research institute Oslo, Institut de recherche sur la paix d\u2019Oslo). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, nous mod\u00e9lisons l\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits arm\u00e9s locaux \u00e0 un moment sp\u00e9cifique sous la forme d\u2019un processus en trois \u00e9tapes. Les \u00e9tapes un et deux de notre approche consistent \u00e0 estimer si nous observerons des pertes respectivement au niveau du pays et de la cellule de grille, tandis que l\u2019\u00e9tape trois consiste \u00e0 appliquer un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gression pour les donn\u00e9es tronqu\u00e9es afin de pr\u00e9dire le nombre de ces pertes en fonction des deux \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Dans ce cadre de mod\u00e9lisation, nous nous concentrons sur le r\u00f4le des importations d\u2019armes gouvernementales en tant que facteur processuel permettant aux gouvernements d\u2019intensifier ou de dissuader les combats. Nous soutenons \u00e9galement que l\u2019isolement g\u00e9ographique d\u2019une cellule de la grille est susceptible de mod\u00e9rer les effets de ces renforcements militaires. Des pr\u00e9dictions hors \u00e9chantillon corroborent l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de notre mod\u00e8le parcimonieux fond\u00e9 sur la th\u00e9orie qui permet une totale transparence associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une pr\u00e9cision du processus de pr\u00e9vision.",

We investigate statistical versions of such questions, by examining the number of battle-deaths in the Correlates of War dataset, with 95 interstate wars from 1816 to 2007. Previous research has found this series of wars to be stationary, with no apparent change over time. We develop a framework to find and assess a change-point in this battle-deaths series. Our change-point methodology takes into consideration the power law distribution of the data, models the full battle-deaths distribution, as opposed to focusing merely on the extreme tail, and evaluates the uncertainty in the estimation. Using this framework, we find evidence that the series has not been as stationary as past research has indicated. Our statistical sightings of better angels indicate that 1950 represents the most likely change-point in the battle-deaths series \u2013 the point in time where the battle-deaths distribution might have changed for the better.",

            "abstract": "In 2008, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency commissioned a database known as the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System to serve as the foundation for models capable of detecting and predicting increases in political conflict worldwide. Such models, by signalling expected increases in political conflict, would help inform and prepare policymakers to react accordingly to conflict proliferation both domestically and internationally. Using data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, we construct and test a self-exciting point process, or Hawkes process, model to describe and predict amounts of domestic, political conflict; we focus on Colombia and Venezuela as examples for this model. By comparing the accuracy of fitted models to the observed data, we find that we are able to closely describe occurrences of conflict in each country. Thus, using this model can allow policymakers to anticipate relative increases in the amount of domestic political conflict following major events.",

            "abstract": "Abstract An abundance of large data sets and improved estimation methods have enabled conflict researchers to estimate the risk of war or terrorist incidents quite precisely. However, as in the case of the prediction of particularly violent earthquakes, forecasting extremely bloody events in continuing conflicts has been difficult until now. This article reports how power laws can be used to predict extreme massacres ex post and ex ante. The power-law distribution that we use is based on the observation that standard probability distributions like the normal distribution typically underestimate the risk of such escalations. Using fatality data until the end of February 2013, we calculate the probability of at least one single event with 250 or more dead civilians at 80% (59%\u201394%) and between March and May 2013 of up to 48%. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of these findings and argue that the forecasts could provide a transparent risk assessment tool to decision makers.

            "abstract": "There is a growing interest in prevention in several policy areas and this provides a strong motivation for an improved integration of forecasting with machine learning into models of decision making. In this article we propose a framework to tackle conflict prevention. A key problem of conflict forecasting for prevention is that predicting the start of conflict in previously peaceful countries needs to overcome a low baseline risk. To make progress in this hard problem this project combines a newspaper-text corpus of more than 4 million articles with unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The output of the forecast model is then integrated into a simple static framework in which a decision maker decides on the optimal number of interventions to minimize the total cost of conflict and intervention. This exercise highlights the potential cost savings of prevention for which reliable forecasts are a prerequisite.

            "abstract": "Determining the number of casualties and fatalities suffered in militarized conflicts is important for conflict measurement, forecasting, and accountability. However, given the nature of conflict, reliable statistics on casualties are rare. Countries or political actors involved in conflicts have incentives to hide or manipulate these numbers, while third parties might not have access to reliable information. For example, in the ongoing militarized conflict between Russia and Ukraine, estimates of the magnitude of losses vary wildly, sometimes across orders of magnitude. In this paper, we offer an approach for measuring casualties and fatalities given multiple reporting sources and, at the same time, accounting for the biases of those sources. We construct a dataset of 4,609 reports of military and civilian losses by both sides. We then develop a statistical model to better estimate losses for both sides given these reports. Our model accounts for different kinds of reporting biases, structural correlations between loss types, and integrates loss reports at different temporal scales. Our daily and cumulative estimates provide evidence that Russia has lost more personnel than has Ukraine and also likely suffers from a higher fatality to casualty ratio. We find that both sides likely overestimate the personnel losses suffered by their opponent and that Russian sources underestimate their own losses of personnel.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In many forecasting settings, there is a specific interest in predicting the sign of an outcome variable correctly in addition to its magnitude. For instance, when forecasting armed conflicts, positive and negative log-changes in monthly fatalities represent escalation and de-escalation, respectively, and have very different implications. In the ViEWS forecasting challenge, a prediction competition on state-based violence, a novel evaluation score called targeted absolute deviation with direction augmentation (TADDA) has therefore been suggested, which accounts for both for the sign and magnitude of log-changes. While it has a straightforward intuitive motivation, the empirical results of the challenge show that a no-change model always predicting a log-change of zero outperforms all submitted forecasting models under the TADDA score. We provide a statistical explanation for this phenomenon. Analyzing the properties of TADDA, we find that in order to achieve good scores, forecasters often have an incentive to predict no or only modest log-changes. In particular, there is often an incentive to report conservative point predictions considerably closer to zero than the forecaster\u2019s actual predictive median or mean. In an empirical application, we demonstrate that a no-change model can be improved upon by tailoring predictions to the particularities of the TADDA score. We conclude by outlining some alternative scoring concepts.",

In addition, to compare and analyze different Bayesian models for international conflict, the authors introduce a new measurement to interpret the relative influence of the model variables on the MIDs. The results indicate that the Gaussian approximation and HMC models are not statistically different in their performance. However HMC correctly recognized a marginally higher number of militarized disputes whose classification is important for policy purpose. On the variable effect, both models indicate similar patter of influences, where the two key liberal variables, democracy and economic interdependence, produce a strong dynamic feedback loop among each other, which greatly increases or decreases the probability of MIDs.",

            "title": "Temperature seasonality and violent conflict",
            "abstract": "Current climate change research suggests that certain seasonal weather patterns will be extended and others attenuated as global temperature increases. This is important because seasonal temperature change affects both the scarcity of resources during certain times of the year and the overall mobility of people living in countries that have seasonality. Consequently, these seasonal changes have implications for the onset of violent conflict, particularly as it relates to distinguishing when, where, and how it is most likely to occur. This article evaluates the relationship between monthly temperature changes, civil war onset, and various, less-organized conflict events, offering theoretical expectations for how seasonal changes and climate aberrations are related to an increased risk of violence. The results show that prolonged periods of stable, warm weather are consistently associated with an increased risk of civil war onset and non-state conflict. These findings are best explained through the strategic viability mechanism of temperature change, which allows actors to resolve their collective action problems that are often associated with poor weather conditions, while simultaneously increasing their strategic and behavioral incentives for engaging in violent conflict. Warm weather generates more resources for rebel looting and permits predictability for coordinating troop movements and strategy development. These findings are particularly salient in areas of the world affected by strong seasonality, where prolonged extensions of warm weather conditions would be regarded as both peculiar and attractive for participating in violent action. Although these findings are notable, even under the most extreme climate change scenarios, the substantive effects for these relationships are comparatively minor relative to other well-known intrastate conflict covariates.",

            "abstract": "Little research has been done on projecting long-term conflict risks. Such projections are currently neither included in the development of socioeconomic scenarios or climate change impact assessments nor part of global agenda-setting policy processes. In contrast, in other fields of inquiry, long-term projections and scenario studies are established and relevant for both strategical agenda-setting and applied policies. Although making projections of armed conflict risk in response to climate change is surrounded by uncertainty, there are good reasons to further develop such scenario-based projections. In this perspective article we discuss why quantifying implications of climate change for future armed conflict risk is inherently uncertain, but necessary for shaping sustainable future policy agendas. We argue that both quantitative and qualitative projections can have a purpose in future climate change impact assessments and put out the challenges this poses for future research.",

In light of predicted shifts in climate patterns and the potentially resulting battle for increasingly scarce resources, it is widely acknowledged that there is an actual risk of increased armed conflict. To efficiently plan and implement adaptation and mitigation measures, it is key to first obtain an understanding of conflict drivers and spatial conflict risk distribution. And second, conflict risk needs to be projected to a given point in the future to be able to prepare accordingly. With CoPro, building and running models investigating the interplay between conflict and climate is made easier. By means of a clear workflow, maps of conflict risk for today as well as the future can be produced. Despite the structured workflow, CoPro caters for a variety of settings and input data, thereby capturing the multitude of facets of the climate-environment-conflict nexus.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and armed civil conflict are both linked to socioeconomic development, although conditions that facilitate peace may not necessarily facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. While economic growth lowers the risk of conflict, it is generally associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and costs of climate mitigation policies. This study investigates the links between growth, climate change, and conflict by simulating future civil conflict using new scenario data for five alternative socioeconomic pathways with different mitigation and adaptation assumptions, known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We develop a statistical model of the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables on country-specific conflict incidence, 1960\u20132013. We then forecast the annual incidence of conflict, 2014\u20132100, along the five SSPs. We find that SSPs with high investments in broad societal development are associated with the largest reduction in conflict risk. This is most pronounced for the least developed countries\u2014poverty alleviation and human capital investments in poor countries are much more effective instruments to attain global peace and stability than further improvements to wealthier economies. Moreover, the SSP that describes a sustainability pathway, which poses the lowest climate change challenges, is as conducive to global peace as the conventional development pathway.",

            "abstract": "This systematic literature review gathers societal vulnerability factors linking climate change and conflict from 53 existing studies. The findings reveal three main points. First, four relevant factors are missing from a previous vulnerability analysis framework proposed by Pearson and Newman: land degradation/land cover, gender, customs, and geographical conditions. Second, two factors, access to technology (e.g., for climate change adaptation) and partially democratic states, are insufficiently studied. Third, classification criteria in the previous framework need revision for accuracy. Considering these points, this study proposes a modified vulnerability analysis framework and offers five suggestions for future research directions in climate security research. First, more qualitative case studies are needed to complement the quantitative work. Second, in particular, cases where conflict was avoided or cooperation was established in high vulnerability areas need further research. Third, further research is needed on understudied factors (e.g., access to technology and partial democracy) and on factors the conventional framework cannot explain (e.g., land degradation/land cover, gender, customs, and geographical conditions). Fourth, no single vulnerability factor leads to conflict in isolation, but only in interaction; their connections must be studied. Finally, case studies are needed on vulnerability factors in countries and regions that have suffered from climate change but have not experienced conflict.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Conflicts, like many social processes, are related events that span multiple scales in time, from the instantaneous to multi-year development, and in space, from one neighborhood to continents. Yet, there is little systematic work on connecting the multiple scales, formal treatment of causality between events, and measures of uncertainty for how events are related to one another. We develop a method for extracting causally related chains of events that addresses these limitations with armed conflict. Our method explicitly accounts for an adjustable spatial and temporal scale of interaction for clustering individual events from a detailed data set, the Armed Conflict Event & Location Data Project. With it, we discover a mesoscale ranging from a week to a few months and tens to hundreds of kilometers, where long-range correlations and nontrivial dynamics relating conflict events emerge. Importantly, clusters in the mesoscale, while extracted from conflict statistics, are identifiable with mechanism cited in field studies. We leverage our technique to identify zones of causal interaction around conflict hotspots that naturally incorporate uncertainties. Thus, we show how a systematic, data-driven, and scalable procedure extracts social objects for study, providing a scope for scrutinizing and predicting conflict and other processes.",

            "abstract": "Since the seminal 2012 Special Issue of the Journal of Peace Research about climate change and conflict, at least 35 review papers on the topic have been published. To our knowledge, none of these reviews focused on water and conflict specifically. In order to address this research gap, the present article conducts a systematic review of scholarship examining the linkages between water and conflict, focusing on quantitative studies using secondary data sources. This review focuses on the African continent given projections about the intersection between water issues and conflict in this region, as well as the popularity of this portion of the world in studies of climate change and conflict. We discuss the findings of papers reviewed and propose six avenues for future research. As research about this topic advances, it will require attention to nuances in data processing, integration, and modeling across spatial and temporal scales, if the outcomes of this body of scholarship are to be leveraged to guide the decision making of governing bodies.",

Our main \ufb01nding is that several recent studies published in top Political Science journals claiming superior performance of ML models over Logistic Regression models fail to reproduce. Our results provide two reasons to be skeptical of the use of ML methods in this research area, by both questioning their usefulness and highlighting the pitfalls of applying them correctly. Results identifying pitfalls in studies that use ML methods have appeared in at least eight quantitative science \ufb01elds. However, we go farther than most previous research to investigate whether the claims made in the reviewed studies survive once the errors are corrected. We argue that there is a reproducibility crisis brewing in research \ufb01elds that use ML methods and discuss a few systemic interventions that could help resolve it.",

Our results indicate that economic conditions do affect the likelihood that a democracy, but not an autocracy, will initiate a fatal militarized dispute, even against another democracy. Economic growth rates sufficiently low to negate the democratic peace are, however, rare; and the behavior of five powerful democracies raises further doubts about the importance of diversions. We find no significant evidence that a bad economy makes a democratic state less likely to be targeted by others, nor does the timing of legislative elections influence the decision of democratic leaders to use force. Although economic conditions affect the likelihood of a fatal dispute for democracies, the influence is sufficiently small that Kant's hope for a more peaceful world does not seem misplaced.",

Yet, whether attempting to prove or disprove the hypothesis, most quantitative studies have lost sight of important dimensions of the Kantian vision. I reinterpret the democratic peace as a dynamic and dialectical learning process. In order to assess the dynamic dimension of this process (while controlling for exogenous dialectical reversals), I rely on quantitative evidence drawn from popular data sets. In conformance with the Kantian perspective, the conflict propensities among democracies exhibit a steadily falling trend since the nineteenth century. Yet, in partial opposition to Kant\u2019s expectations, other dyads also experience a significant, although weaker, pacifying trend. A series of tests shows that these findings are robust to epochal effects, various control variables, and \u201cmaturity effects\u201d measuring the age of democratic dyads.",

Neural networks may also be important for modeling international behavior because of structural similarities with some organizational processes used to determine foreign policy. In split-sample tests using the Butterworth international conflict data set, the neural network outperforms both discriminant analysis and ID3 in terms of accuracy; it is roughly comparable in accuracy to multinomial logit. The neural network is less successful than discriminant and logit at predicting nonmodal values of the dependent variable. The variables identified as important in the neural network appear to be similar to those significant in the discriminant analysis, but are quite different than those used by ID3. Keywords: neural networks, artificial intelligence, international conflict, ID3, logit analysis, discriminant analysis.",

So far, the debate has followed lines of analysis laid by the original dispute between Samuel Huntington and Morris Janowitz. Viewed from a post-Cold War perspective, however, neither model is attractive. In this article, I define the basic problematique both the Huntingtonian and Janowitzean theories attempt to explain: how to reconcile a military strong enough to do anything the civilians ask them to with a military subordinate enough to do only what civilians authorize them to do. Next I critically evaluate and call into question the continued validity of key propositions of each theory and especially their reliance on \"professionalism.\" The article concludes with a brief summary of the criteria that should guide the development of a new theory of civilian control.",

            "abstract": "For six decade the Soviet system has been immune to military rebellion and takeover, which often characterizes modernizing countries. How can we explain the stability of Soviet military politics, asks Timothy Colton in his compelling interpretation of civil-military relations in the Soviet Union. Hitherto most western scholars have posited a basic dichotomy of interests between the Soviet army and the Communist party. They view the two institutions as conflictprone, with civilian supremacy depending primarily upon the party's control of officers through its organs within the military establishment. Colton challenges this thesis and argues that the military party organs have come to possess few of the attributes of an effective controlling device, and that the commissars and their heirs have operated as allies rather than adversaries of the military commanders. In explaining the extraordinary stability in army-party relations in terms of overlapping interests rather than controlling mechanisms, Colton offers a major case study and a new model to students of comparative military politics.",

The study found evidence that ethno-religious polarization is a predictor of trends of communal violence in Nigeria. The weakest predictor of communal violence, according to the model, is climate vulnerability in Nigeria.",

            "abstract": "Food security has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Yet, despite preliminary evidence connecting food insecurity to political violence, we lack a systematic understanding of the relationship(s) between local food resources and violence against civilians. This study develops a food-security based theory to explain the significant variation that we observe in violence against civilians across both time and subnational geographic space. We argue that combatants, be they government or rebel actors, often must turn to local agricultural resources for sustenance. During times of relative peace, armed actors and civilians have long time horizons, and the prospects of repeated interactions thereby promote a strategy of co-optation to obtain food resources. However, the existence of immediate conflict in a region leads armed actors to discount the benefits of future interactions in favor of obtaining food immediately, using violence if necessary. In estimating a series of statistical models on a sample of all African countries (1997\u20132009), we find robust support for our expectations: cropland increases the frequency of violence against civilians during periods of conflict, but has an added pacifying effect during times of peace.",

            "abstract": "For at least the last two decades, the international community in general and the United Nations specifically have attempted to develop robust, accurate and effective conflict early warning system for conflict prevention. One potential and promising component of integrated early warning systems lies in the field of machine learning. This paper aims at giving conflict analysis a basic understanding of machine learning methodology as well as to test the feasibility and added value of such an approach. The paper finds that the selection of appropriate machine learning methodologies can offer substantial improvements in accuracy and performance. It also finds that even at this early stage in testing machine learning on conflict prediction, full models offer more predictive power than simply using a prior outbreak of violence as the leading indicator of current violence. This suggests that a refined data selection methodology combined with strategic use of machine learning algorithms could indeed offer a significant addition to the early warning toolkit. Finally, the paper suggests a number of steps moving forward to improve upon this initial test methodology.",

            "title": "Ecoviolence? Links between Population Growth, Environmental Scarcity and Violent Conflict in Thomas Homer-Dixon's Work (1)",
            "abstract": "\"Qualitative degradation or quantitative depletion reduces the total size of the pie. A growing number of people sharing the pie implies that each share of the pie shrinks. And finally, if the pie is distributed in pieces of unequal sizes, some may be too small for people to survive on.\" Thomas Homer-Dixon has published extensively on population, environment and conflict. His theoretical framework first appeared in several seminal articles in the early to mid-1990s, (2) and research by Homer-Dixon and his colleagues on the relationship between population, environment and violent conflict has been influential in the field of political science. (3) In view of the widespread nature of human conflict (4) and the prevailing pessimism about population growth and environmental destruction, this linkage is clearly both important and policy-relevant. In addition to outlining what he believes to be the main causal mechanisms, Homer-Dixon has also examined a number of cases in detail. Homer-Dixon's work is far removed from the simplifications of some of the popular literature on the theme of population, environment and conflict. There is little if any of the sensationalism of Robert D. Kaplan (5) or the doomsday predictions of Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich. (6) Homer-Dixon never asserts that population pressure and environmental degradation are the sole source of violent conflict. On the contrary, he emphasizes again and again the close interrelationship between demographic/environmental, social and political factors in the generation of violent conflict. In the following, the basic theoretical scheme of Thomas Homer-Dixon's work on population, environment and violent conflict is presented, and then some of the main criticisms of his work are explored and summarized in five points. These criticisms relate both to his theoretical model and to his empirical studies. Lastly, a brief introduction to some of the recent comparative empirical studies aimed at testing Homer-Dixon's hypotheses more broadly is given. THE LINKS BETWEEN POPULATION, ENVIRONMENT AND CONFLICT Like other neo-Malthusian scholars, Homer-Dixon focuses on population variables. (7) He views population pressure as closely linked to the potential scarcity of renewable resources. While he argues that resource scarcities can cause violent intrastate conflict under unfavorable conditions, he believes that such scarcities are less likely to cause interstate conflict. (8) Homer-Dixon and Jessica Blitt distinguish among three main causes of resource scarcity. (9) Supply-induced scarcity results from degradation or depletion of natural resources. Non-sustainable use may not allow a resource to regenerate. (10) In some cases this process causes a resource to become irreversibly and permanently degraded even though the human activities that led to degradation are halted. Demand-induced scarcity is primarily caused by population growth. If a resource base is constant, the availability of resources per person diminishes as the number of persons sharing it increases. Such scarcity can also arise from an increase in demand per capita. A third form, structural scarcity, applies only to certain groups who, relative to other groups, are excluded from equal access to particular resources. Such unequal social distribution of a resource does not presuppose actual scarcity if the resource were to be distributed evenly. Figure 1, below, illustrates Homer-Dixon's view of the links among these forms of scarcity and armed conflict. Figure 1. Sources and Consequences of Environmental Scarcity (11) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] One of Homer-Dixon's strengths and one of the reasons why he has attracted so much attention is that he presents his notion of environmental scarcity in a very simple and intuitively appealing way. A prime example is his pie metaphor to describe the three forms of resource scarcity. \u2026",

            "abstract": "Abstract : Nations transitioning into conflict is an issue of national interest. This study considers various data for inclusion in a statistical model that predicts the future state of the world where nations will either be in a state of violent conflict or not in violent conflict based on available historical data. Logistic regression is used to construct and test various models to produce a parsimonious world model with 15 variables. Further analysis shows that nations differ significantly by geographical area. Therefore six sub-models are constructed for differing geographical areas of the world. The dominant variables for each sub-model vary, suggesting a complex world that cannot be modeled as a whole. Insights and conclusions are gathered from the models, a best model is proposed, and predictions are made for the state of the world in 2015. Accuracy of predictions via validation surpasses 80%. Eighty-five nations are predicted to be in a state of violent conflict in 2015, seventeen of them are new to conflict since the last published list in 2013. A prediction tool is created to allow war-game subject matter experts and students to identify future predicted violent conflict and the responsible variables.",

            "title": "Predicting Future War",
            "abstract": "Abstract: This article assesses how we think about future war, drawing attention to its associated caveats, obstacles, and intellectual problems. It is divided into three sections: the first acknowledges that predicting the future is immensely problematic, but suggests history can be a critical guide. The second assesses the present and why it is difficult to conceive of accelerating change. The third examines the trends of future war. The article concludes with implications for US forces. Predicting the Future Operating Environment Throughout history, changes in the character of war have been I difficult for contemporaries to identify, particularly during long it periods of peace. While there may be trends and enduring principles of strategy and international relations, it is the variability of conditions, changes in the application of technology, adaptation, and the dynamics of conflict that make prediction, and consequently planning, very challenging. The problem of prediction has not prevented bold assertions, and some dystopian visions of the future have been propagated through sensationalist tracts and even, apparently, in serious scholarship. The modern prophets of doom who foresee a Hobbesian anarchy include such distinguished names as Robert Kaplan, Francis Fukuyama, Samuel B. Huntington and, albeit to a less apocalyptic extent, David Kilcullen. (1) Martin van Creveld and Philip Bobbitt suggest the state is in terminal decline in international affairs, opening the way for chaos and warfare. (2) Others claimed that war would be conducted \"amongst the people\" with dire results in terms of civilian casualties, and the official United Kingdom military doctrine of 2009 on future character of conflict referred, in solely negative terms, to a \"hybrid\" battlefield that would be inevitably \"contested, congested, cluttered, connected and constrained.\" (3) Works on global strategic trends predict a violent future amidst diminishing natural resources, climatic pressures, and global population growth. Nevertheless, such projections are starkly at odds with the conclusions of Steve Pinker, Andrew Mack, and Flavard Hegre, specifically that war, both minor and major, is in decline. (4) Statistical work at Uppsala University, incorporating all the standard drivers of conflict since 1945, forecast a reduction in the number of wars and in the overall casualty toll in the next fifty years. In the past, attempts to predict the future of war were just as contradictory. It was always tempting for contemporaries to hold on to strongly-held values and force structures and to downplay unpalatable truths. The selection of preferred assumptions, rather than absolute truths, was a common problem. Nevertheless, some projections, dismissed as absurd by contemporaries, proved accurate in time. Selection, exaggeration, absurdity, contemporary fears and preferences, misunderstanding, and misplaced long-range forecasts were the characteristics of predicting future war in the past, and all these traits still dominate the present. (5) There are many reasons why prediction is so difficult, even when there are apparently obvious positivist \"trends\" to guide us. It is tempting to make projections in the present based on the types of wars that seem the most prevalent today and to assume that, for the foreseeable future, all wars will fall into this pattern. Military analysts want to identify the characteristics of future war with some accuracy, not least because expensive technological development programs depend on their judgments, training of specialists is long term, and governments require success with the greatest efficiency. The difficulty is that success is contingent on context. Clarity in what the objective is must be essential, but the dynamics of war frequently change the conditions under which the conflict was entered. Aims, therefore, evolve just as rapidly and comprehensively as the conflict itself. Trends of the recent past give strong indications about war in the near future but still require caution. \u2026",

            "title": "Modeling the coevolution of international and domestic institutions",
            "abstract": "While much previous research has examined the relationship between interstate military alliances and the structure of domestic regimes, existing findings point in contradictory directions. Some have argued that democracies attract each other as alliance partners, and thereby generate international peace as a consequence of their domestic regime type, while others have argued that the causal relationship is reversed, and that international pacification creates the necessary space for international alliances and domestic democratization. To disentangle this difficult empirical relationship, this article presents an empirically grounded simulation model of the dynamic coevolution of interstate military alliances, international conflict, and domestic democratization, demonstrating a statistical approach which accounts both for the complex interdependencies generated by coevolving multiplex networks of interstate ties and for their reciprocal influence on the coevolution of domestic political regimes, over the period 1920\u20132000. The results show that international institutions and domestic institutions are mutually constituted, with both \u2018selection\u2019 effects and \u2018influence\u2019 effects operating simultaneously. In particular, the evidence indicates that states with similar regimes are more prone to ally with each other, mutually democratic dyads are less inclined to engage in militarized disputes, and states that form international alliances with democratic partners are more likely to develop domestic democratic institutions. Tests of out-of-sample predictive accuracy, across multidecade prediction windows, further demonstrate that the coevolutionary model consistently outperforms specifications that ignore coevolutionary effects, in predicting subsequent patterns of military alliances, military conflict, and domestic democratization.",

The burgeoning democratic peace literature has provided strong empirical evidence for the claim that democracies are a cause of peace. However, several skeptics of the democratic peace have suggested that the statistical findings are spurious. We test these competing claims using a simultaneous equation model. Using a unique data-set of all international disputes from 1960 to 1988, we find strong support for reciprocal causation. As the democratic peace theorists claim, democracy causes peace even after controlling for military conflict in the system and region. Conversely, peace in the region appears to encourage the development of democratic polities.",

            "title": "Explaining Interstate Conflict and War: What Should Be Controlled for?",
            "abstract": "Most multivariate models designed by analysts of intemational conflict focus on one key explanatory factor and include several control variables. There are prominent norms or customs in the subfield of international politics regarding the construction of multivariate models and the selection of control variables. Several of these norms or customs may make the results of multivariate analyses confusing and difficult to interpret. Analysts typically do not, for example, distinguish between confounding and intervening variables even though the implications and impacts of such variables are substantially different. Most researchers also fail to distinguish between confounding variables and variables that have an impact on interstate conflict that is complementary to that of the key explanatory factor. Commonly, control variables are included in a model for no other reason than that they also have an impact on interstate conflict or some other outcome variable. In some recent analyses, \"independent\" variables are included that are related by definition to the key explanatory variable, or to each other. This practice introduces into multivariate models artifactual, misleading degrees of statistical association between variables related to each other by definition with tautological relationships masquerading as empirical causal connections that complicate the interpretation of results. Finally, the construction of pooled cross-sectional, time series analyses is consistently based on the assumption that the key explanatory factor, as well as the control variables, have essentially identical impacts on interstate conflict across space, and over time. Substantial evidence, some of which is provided in this paper, suggests that this assumption is unwarranted. This paper provides five guidelines for the construction of multivariate models that address these issues in a manner aimed at making the results of multivariate analyses more intelligible and credible.",

We demonstrate the usefulness of the model through Monte Carlo experiments and replications of published work and also show that the substantive effects of covariates derived from the ZiOP model can reveal nonmonotonic relationships between these covariates and one\u2019s conflict probabilities of interest.",

            "abstract": "The primary objective of this article is to advance the development of early warning of intrastate conflict by combining country-level structural and events data in a logistic regression model calibrated and validated using split-sample cases. Intrastate conflict is defined by the occurrence of one or more highly destabilizing events collectively termed a crisis of interest (COI). Two separate two-year periods between 1990 and 2005 were examined in twenty-five globally dispersed countries. COIs occurred in about 6 percent of all the half-monthly periods examined. While model accuracy (total correct predictions of COI and non-COI) usually exceeded 90 percent, the model did not generate sufficiently high and consistent precision (correct number of COI over total predicted) and recall (correct number of COI over total observed) for practical use.",

            "title": "Repression, Grievances, Mobilization, and Rebellion: A New Test of Gurr\u2019s Model of Ethnopolitical Rebellion",
            "abstract": "Throughout the 1990s Ted Robert Gurr developed and refined a model of ethnopolitical rebellion built around four key determinants\u2014identity, incentives, capacity, and opportunities. Lindstr\u00f6m and Moore (1995), Gurr and Moore (1997), and Moore and Gurr (1998) have argued that the explanation Gurr proposes actually implies an interactive model in which these four factors, along with rebellion and repression, work interdependently to determine levels of rebellious ethnic conflict. In this study I utilize a three-stage least squares estimator to test the ability of this interactive model to explain the magnitude of ethnopolitical rebellion in the seventeen regions of Spain from 1977\u20131996. The use of an original event data set with enhanced indicators allows for the first test of Gurr\u2019s interactive model not based on the Minorities at Risk project, while the cross-temporal design facilitates the first full test of the model\u2019s democracy-rebellion linkages. This test demonstrates even stronger overall support for the theoretical model than previous analyses, which had failed to find evidence for the direct influence of grievances on rebellion, of democratization and repression on mobilization, and of democracy on repression. An important deviation from Gurr\u2019s model is the finding that three of the proposed indicators of deprivation\u2014relative regional GDP, education, and regional autonomy\u2014were found to have the opposite impact from that intended. Implications of these findings are explored in depth. I would like to thank the editors and the reviewers for their helpful comments.

            "title": "Forecasting Political Conflict in Asia using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Models \u2217",
            "abstract": "Latent Dirichlet allocation models are a relatively new computational classification algorithm. In its standard application to document classification, the model assumes each document to be composed of a mixture of multiple, overlapping topics each with a typical set of words, and classification is done by associating words in a document with the latent topics most likely to have generated the observed distribution of those words. I apply this technique to the problem of political forecasting by assuming that the stream of events observed between a dyad of actors is a mixture of a variety of different political strategies and standard operating procedures (for example escalation of repressive measures against a minority group while simultaneously making efforts to co-opt the elites of that group). By identifying the dominant strategies being pursued at time t, one gets information that can be used to forecast likely patterns of interaction at a later time t + k. This approach is applied to event data generated for 29 Asian countries in the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System project for 1998-2010 to forecast the ICEWS conflict measures for rebellion, insurgency, ethno-religious violence, domestic political conflict and international conflict at a six month lead time. In random samples balancing the occurrence of negative and positive outcomes on the dependent variable, LDA combined with a logistic model predicts with around 60% to 70% accuracy in in-sample evaluation, and improves very substantially on the sensitivity of the classification compared with simple logistic models in full samples. A supervised version of LDA, however, does not provide much improvement over the unsupervised version, and shows some pathological behaviors. Some structure can be found in the factors, though more work is needed on this.",

            "abstract": "What explains armed-group conduct toward civilians in war? The National Resistance Army (NRA) of Uganda demonstrated notable restraint toward civilians during its wars in northern Uganda in the 1980s, restraint that is puzzling given the overdetermined predictions for mass atrocity under rationalist, identity, and regime-type theories. Instead, the NRA case demonstrates that military culture\u2014the organizational norms underlying combatant socialization\u2014is a primary determinant of armed-group behavior, influencing combatant conduct in ways not conceptualized under existing theories of victimization. This review of the NRA case, based on field interviews with Ugandan military officers and examinations of Ugandan documentary archives, reveals three key points regarding the role of military culture in effecting restraint. First, the NRA case shows that organizational factors like military culture can determine military behavior toward civilians. Second, it reveals that theories of military culture, incorporating both formal and informal mechanisms of combatant socialization, can provide a more complete theoretical account than existing theories of armed-group conduct. Finally, the NRA provides potential hypotheses for mechanisms through which culture influences military behavior. I analyze the effect of culture on the NRA's conduct as a plausibility probe, generating inductive insights drawn from detailed field research to shed light on the organizational drivers of armed-group restraint. The NRA case thus points the way to a reconceptualization of military culture and the role of organizational factors that influence conflict behavior.",

The \u201cwar renewal\u201d school of thought maintains that wars can produce beneficial effects as they improve efficiency in the economy, especially by reducing the power of special interests, bring technological innovation, and advance human capital. The \u201cwar ruin\u201d school of thought sees mostly detrimental effects resulting from war. We seek to address two critical questions. First, which perspective on wars and economic growth is more accurate? Second, to what extent do policy choices at both the domestic and international levels exert influence on economic growth? We develop several hypotheses to assess these arguments, and utilizing a 2SLS model, test them on data for all nations for the period 1960\u20132002. We find that generally wars exercise negative economic effects and that economic fundamentals, as well as the response by the international community to civil wars, exert powerful effects on economic growth.",

These two types differ in their forms of production: while indirect violence is unilaterally perpetrated by an armed group, direct violence is jointly produced by an armed group and civilians, and it hinges on local collaboration. These differences have consequences for the spatial variation of each of these types: in conventional civil wars, indirect violence is hypothesized to be positively associated with levels of prewar support for the enemy group; in contrast, direct violence is hypothesized to increase with the level of political parity between factions in a locality. The predictions are tested with a novel dataset of 1,710 municipalities in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish civil war (1936\u20141939).",

            "abstract": "This article presents new data on the start and end dates and the means of termination for armed conflicts, 1946\u20142005. These data contribute to quantitative research on conflict resolution and recurrence in three important respects: the data cover both interstate and intrastate armed conflicts, the data cover low-intensity conflicts, and the data provide information on a broad range of termination outcomes. In order to disaggregate the UCDP-PRIO Armed Conflict dataset into multiple analytical units, this dataset introduces the concept of conflict episodes, defined as years of continuous use of armed force in a conflict. Using these data, general trends and patterns are presented, showing that conflicts do not exclusively end with decisive outcomes such as victory or peace agreement but more often under unclear circumstances where fighting simply ceases. This pattern is consistent across different types of conflict, as is the finding that victories are more common in conflicts with short duration. The article then examines some factors that have been found to predict civil war recurrence and explores whether using the new dataset produces similar results. This exercise offers a number of interesting new insights and finds that the determinants for civil war recurrence identified in previous research are sensitive to alternate formulations of conflict termination data. The findings suggest that intrastate conflicts are less likely to recur after government victories or after the deployment of peacekeepers. If the previous conflict is fought with rebels aiming for total control over government or if the belligerents mobilized along ethnic lines, the risk of recurrence increases. The discrepancy in findings with previous research indicates the need for further study of conflict resolution and recurrence, for which this dataset will be useful.",

This study seeks to extend this insight by considering how different civil war conflict strategies influence post-conflict public health. Drawing a distinction between deaths attributable to battle and those fatalities resulting from genocide/politicide, we find that the magnitude of genocide/politicide proves the more effective and consistent predictor of future rates of disability and death in the aftermath of civil war. The implications of this research are twofold. First, it lends support to an emerging literature suggesting that important distinctions exist between the forms of violence occurring during civil war. Second, of particular interest to policymakers, it identifies post-civil war states that have experienced the highest rates of genocide/politicide as the countries most in need of assistance in the aftermath of conflict.",

            "abstract": "This article presents new data on the direct and deliberate killings of civilians, called one-sided violence, in intrastate armed conflicts, 1989\u20142004. These data contribute to the present state of quantitative research on violence against civilians in three important respects: the data provide actual estimates of civilians killed, the data are collected annually and the data are provided for both governments and rebel groups. Using these data, general trends and patterns are presented, showing that the post-Cold War era is characterized by periods of fairly low-scale violence punctuated by occasional sharp increases in violence against civilians. Furthermore, rebels tend to be more violent on the whole, while governments commit relatively little violence except in those few years which see mass killings. The article then examines some factors that have been found to predict genocide and evaluates how they correlate with one-sided violence as conceptualized here. A U-shaped correlation between regime type and one-sided violence is identified: while autocratic governments undertake higher levels of one-sided violence than other regime types, rebels are more violent in democratic countries.",

The \u201cwar renewal\u201d school of thought maintains that wars can produce beneficial effects as they improve efficiency in the economy, especially by reducing the power of special interests, bring technological innovation, and advance human capital. The \u201cwar ruin\u201d school of thought sees mostly detrimental effects resulting from war. We seek to address two critical questions. First, which perspective on wars and economic growth is more accurate? Second, to what extent do policy choices at both the domestic and international levels exert influence on economic growth? We develop several hypotheses to assess these arguments, and utilizing a 2SLS model, test them on data for all nations for the period 1960\u20132002. We find that generally wars exercise negative economic effects and that economic fundamentals, as well as the response by the international community to civil wars, exert powerful effects on economic growth.",

            "abstract": "Abstract : The defense debate tends to treat Afghanistan as either a revolution or a fluke: either the \"Afghan Model\" of special operations forces (SOF) plus precision munitions plus an indigenous ally is a widely applicable template for American defense planning, or it is a nonreplicable product of local idiosyncrasies. In fact, it is neither. The Afghan campaign of last fall and winter was actually much closer to a typical 20th century mid-intensity conflict, albeit one with unusually heavy fire support for one side. And this view has very different implications than either proponents or skeptics of the Afghan Model now claim. Afghan Model skeptics often point to Afghanistan's unusual culture of defection or the Taliban's poor skill or motivation as grounds for doubting the war's relevance to the future. Afghanistan's culture is certainly unusual, and there were many defections. The great bulk, however, occurred after the military tide had turned not before-hand. They were effects, not causes. The Afghan Taliban were surely unskilled and ill-motivated. The non-Afghan al Qaeda, however, have proven resolute and capable fighters. Their host's collapse was not attributable to any al Qaeda shortage of commitment or training. Afghan Model proponents, by contrast, credit precision weapons with annihilating enemies at a distance before they could close with our commandos or indigenous allies. Hence the model's broad utility: with SOF-directed bombs doing the real killing, even ragtag local militias will suffice as allies. All they need do is screen U.S. commandos from the occasional hostile survivor and occupy the abandoned ground thereafter. Yet the actual fighting in Afghanistan involved substantial close combat. Al Qaeda counterattackers closed, unseen, to pointblank range of friendly forces in battles at Highway 4 and Sayed Slim Kalay.",

To explore this question we present an expected utility model of the choice rebels and governments face between accepting a settlement or continuing to fight. The model implies that a settlement becomes more likely as (1) estimates of the probability of victory decline; (2) costs of conflict increase; (3) estimates of the time required to win increase; or (4) the utility from a settlement increases relative to that of victory. Factors that (1) increase one party's probability of victory; (2) increase its payoffs from victory; (3) reduce the costs of conflict; and/or (4) reduce the time required to achieve victory increase that party's probability of winning and decrease the likelihood of a settlement. We test these propositions with a multinomial choice model that correctly predicts the outcome in 86 percent of the cases.",

            "abstract": "Civil conflicts inevitably have negative consequences with regards to respect for human rights within affected states. Unfortunately, the violation of human rights often does not end with the conflict. What factors explain variation in state repression in post-civil conflict societies? Can international interventions, both civilian and military, improve human rights in states with a history of conflict? Does the size of the intervention matter? We argue that international interventions, including peacekeeping missions and officially directed foreign aid, can reduce physical integrity abuses. This process occurs by simultaneously increasing protections for civilians while also raising the costs of repression to both government leaders and their agents. Human rights abuses will also decrease when there are legal remedies available to vulnerable populations which are bolstered by a strong judicial system. A robust civil society can also discourage human rights abuses by shedding light on these events and providing human rights education. In line with our theoretical argument, we focus on UN peacekeeping missions, especially those with human rights teams, and officially directed foreign aid for legal and security sector reform and NGOs. Using both a treatment effects approach and a continuous dose\u2013response model, we find much support for the implications of our argument.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Research into the causes of civilian abuse during civil conflict has increased significantly in recent years, yet the mechanisms responsible for changes in actors' tactics remain poorly understood. I investigate how the outcomes of discrete conflict interactions influence subsequent patterns of rebel violence against civilians. Two competing logics suggest opposite influences of material loss on violence. A stylized model of rebel-civilian bargaining illustrates how acute resource demands resulting from recent severe conflict losses may incentivize insurgent violence and predation. I also identify several factors that might condition this relationship. I evaluate hypotheses based on these expectations by first analyzing the behaviors of the Lord's Resistance Army using subnational conflict data and then analyzing a cross-sectional sample of post\u2013Cold War African insurgencies. Results from both the micro- and macrolevel analyses suggest that rising battlefield costs incentivize attacks on civilians in the period immediately following the accrual of losses. However, group-level factors such as effective control over territory and the sources of rebel financing condition this relationship. The findings suggest potential benefits from examining the interaction of strategic conditions and more static organizational characteristics in explaining temporal and geographic variation in rebel violence.",

            "abstract": "The literature on war economies argues that prolonged civil wars have an economic logic: certain groups may obtain material gains from committing acts of violence and hence resist peacebuilding efforts. Objective tests of these predictions have so far been limited, as corruption and conflict prevent the collection of reliable economic data on the ground. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Science techniques enable us to overcome these problems of terrestrial data collection. Electricity consumption manifested as night-time light emissions recorded in satellite images is proposed as a proxy for changes in disposable income in Somalia\u2019s cities. The nightlight images provide striking illustrations of economic decline and recovery and clearly show the contrast between the stable regions of Northern Somalia and the chaos and anarchy of Southern Somalia. Based on geospatial analyses of settlement patterns in Somali cities, we argue that specific metrics of light output can be used to proxy for the incomes of different social groups. We use geo-coded conflict event data to analyze the economic impact of conflict on local light output and therefore incomes. We find a significant peace dividend for poorer households located at the margins of cities, which benefit both from local stability and more peaceful conditions in the country as a whole. By contrast, the central business districts are relatively well insulated from the effects of local conflict, and violence in Mogadishu has positive effects on light output from cities where humanitarian aid agencies are located. Future peace initiatives need to confront these economic incentives for continued conflict and state failure in Somalia.",

The capability of a country (a.k.a. its national strength) is largest at its home base and declines as the nation moves away. Capable states are relatively less impeded by distance and can therefore influence more distant regions. Given armed conflict, battles are expected to occur in areas where the projected powers of the antagonists are comparable. When the aggressor\u2019s projected power is greater than the national strength of the defender, the latter side should give in without violence. This paper is a first attempt to apply Boulding\u2019s theory of international power projection to the study of civil war. Using new data on the point location of conflict onset and a variety of measures of state and rebel strength, this paper tests empirically one corollary of the LSG model: that civil wars in general locate further away from the capital in more powerful regimes.",

            "abstract": "A range of seemingly rival theories attempt to explain why some individuals take extraordinary risks by choosing to participate in armed conflict. To date, however, competing accounts have typically not been grounded in systematic, empirical studies of the determinants of participation. In this article, we begin to fill this gap through an examination of the determinants of participation in insurgent and counterinsurgent factions in Sierra Leone\u2019s civil war. We find some support for all of the competing theories, suggesting that the rivalry between them is artificial and that theoretical work has insufficiently explored the interaction of various recruitment strategies. At the same time, the empirical results challenge standard interpretations of grievance-based accounts of participation, as poverty, a lack of access to education, and political alienation predict participation in both rebellion and counterrebellion. Factors that are traditionally seen as indicators of grievance or frustration may instead proxy for a more general susceptibility to engage in violent action or a greater vulnerability to political manipulation by elites. hy do some individuals take enormous risks to participate as fighters in civil war? What differentiates those who are mobilized from those who remain on the sidelines? What distinguishes those who rebel from those who fight to defend the status quo? In spite of a large literature on the topic, scholars continue to debate the conditions under which men and women take up arms to participate in deadly combat. In this article, we examine the evidence for prominent, competing arguments in the context of Sierra Leone\u2019s civil war, drawing on a unique dataset that records the attitudes and behavior of 1,043 excombatants alongside a sample of 184 noncombatants.",

            "title": "Violence Against Civilians in Civil Wars: Looting or Terror?",
            "abstract": "This article analyses the motives of violence against civilians during internal wars. It is suggested that soldiers may terrorize civilians because they need the loot to augment their resources while the rest of the time is engaged in fighting proper. An alternative hypothesis suggests that terrorizing the civilian population plays a direct military role. The displacement of large fractions of the civilian population reduces the fighting efficiency of the enemy, as they cannot hide as easily and obtain less support. These two alternative hypotheses are investigated in a simple two-stage game-theoretic model. At stage 1, the government and the rebels simultaneously decide on the level of forces engaged in violence against civilians before they choose the level of forces that they engage in the fighting proper at stage 2. There are two types of sub-game perfect equilibria in this model: there is a pure fighting equilibrium in which no violence against civilians takes place and a pure terror equilibrium. In the latter equilibrium, it is shown that terror substitutes for fighting if the government can afford it. Predictions of the model are tested using African refugee data. In accordance with the theoretical model, the refugee population displays strong positive serial correlation, and after controlling for war, overseas development assistance has a positive impact on the outflow of refugees. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that violence against civilians is motivated by military objectives and suggest that donor funding to governments at war should be cut if the protection of civilians is regarded as more important than the fate of the fighters.",

We consider one case of a natural shock that directly affected an ongoing rebellion, Mozambique\u2019s Cabo Delgado insurgency, where in recent years an insurgency with few societal ties and an extremist, pro-Islamic State ideology has engaged in multiple attacks on civilians. Our assessment employs both time series analysis and qualitative evaluations. Our focus is on the effects of cyclones\u2014a climatic event whose rates are predicted to intensify over the coming decades\u2014on this insurgency\u2019s use of violence against civilians. In contrast to several past studies of natural shocks in conflict zones and strategic violence against civilians, our findings suggest that in contexts of insurgencies that do not have a strong local support base and where the group purports an extremist transnational ideology, natural shocks may lead to more violence against civilians.",

Assuming that intentional violence against civilians is an inferior input and fighting rebels is subject to increasing marginal returns, three weak state conditions \u2013 anocracy, new state status, and low income \u2013 increase civilian atrocities within the model. Also, two other risk factors for mass atrocities \u2013 discrimination and Cold War conditions \u2013 can be seen as \u201cprice reducers\u201d for killing civilians, thus increasing the quantity demanded for civilian atrocities in the model. The modeling exercises show how intentional violence against civilians can be viewed through an economic lens of optimal choice and how rational choice theory provides a parsimonious way to theorize and generate empirically testable hypotheses about risk factors for genocide and mass killing.",

The first model is global and includes all country-years for which data are available.

The second model uses a smaller sample restricted to conflict-years. It correctly identifies nine of the ten cases of genocide onset and the number of false alarms is reduced, although the model needs further improvements before it can be put to practical use. While developing the models in an inductive, iterative way, I identify a number of factors that correlate with genocide onset, adding to existing research. These include direct threats to a government (riots, assassinations and, in one of the robustness tests, anti-government demonstrations) and economic discrimination against ethnic groups.",

Users of ATM can simply upload a dataset, choose a subset of modeling methods, and choose to use ATM's hybrid Bayesian and multi-armed bandit optimization system. The distributed system works in a load-balanced fashion to quickly deliver results in the form of ready-to-predict models, confusion matrices, cross-validation results, and training timings. By automating hyperparameter tuning and model selection, ATM returns the emphasis of the machine learning workflow to its most irreducible part: feature engineering. We demonstrate the usefulness of ATM on 420 datasets from OpenML and train over 3 million classifiers. Our initial results show ATM can beat human-generated solutions for 30% of the datasets, and can do so in 1/100th of the time.",

            "abstract": "Significance Many studies in international relations have investigated relationships between pairs of countries and the likelihood of conflict, yet none have connected the overall structure of the network of relationships between countries with the total level of international conflict. Here, we blaze a new path in the study of international conflict by introducing a measure of the overall fractionalization in the network of international relationships which we call Kantian fractionalization and demonstrating that this measure has been closely correlated with the number of new international conflicts in the following year. Moreover, we show that jointly democratic pairs of countries contribute negligibly to Kantian fractionalization, casting doubt on one of the most prominent concepts in international relations and policy prescriptions in Washington. Network science has spurred a reexamination of relational phenomena in political science, including the study of international conflict. We introduce a new direction to the study of conflict by showing that the multiplex fractionalization of the international system along three key dimensions is a powerful predictor of the propensity for violent interstate conflict. Even after controlling for well-established conflict indicators, our new measure contributes more to model fit for interstate conflict than all of the previously established measures combined. Moreover, joint democracy plays little, if any, role in predicting system stability, thus challenging perhaps the major empirical finding of the international relations literature. Lastly, the temporal variability of our measure with conflict is consistent with a causal relationship. Our results have real-world policy implications as changes in our fractionalization measure substantially aid the prediction of conflict up to 10 years into the future, allowing it to serve as an early warning sign of international instability.",

            "abstract": "The forecasting literature has come to mistrust the predictions made by experts who forecast political events in mass media. Distinguishing between judgements made by one or few individuals (\u2018oracles\u2019) and assessments made by larger groups (\u2018crowds\u2019), we contrast journalistic predictions with forecasts stemming from the financial industry. These two competing views were evaluated in a quantitative analysis of the ex ante success of 24 ceasefire agreements in various conflicts which took place in the Levant from 1993 to 2014. Our analysis compares the forecasts appearing in press commentaries (Haaretz, Jerusalem Post and New York Times) with the expectations that the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange had about the stability of these cooperative efforts. To evaluate the predictions of these very dissimilar sources, the effectiveness of the ceasefires was analysed through the number of violent events following the official start of the truce. The analysis shows that the financial industry performs better than the media industry in the comparative evaluation of ceasefire forecasts, but that neither source provides sufficiently accurate predictions. The partial support for the crowd thesis is discussed in light of recent literature that resuscitates the usage of well-trained experts for forecasting purposes, but warns against the dramatizing predictions of media pundits.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to identify the determinants of displacement behavior based on various push and pull factors at the village level. The study concentrates on changes in village population during three years of civil conflict (1999\u20142002) in Aceh, Indonesia. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset from two census rounds of the Indonesian Village Potential Census (PODES). It uses data on around 5,200 Acehnese villages and relates village-level population change to conflict variables, geographic patterns, and traditional socio-economic determinants of migration. By applying quantile regressions, the push (outflow) factors and the pull (inflow) determinants of migration can also be distinguished. The authors identify the following factors as the main determinants of the Aceh migration pattern in this period. First, conflict clashes induced large rearrangements of the population between villages in highly affected districts, as well as strong village emigration from the geographically remote regions in Central Aceh towards the less conflict-affected coastal industrial areas. Besides conflict factors, an (ongoing) rural\u2014urban migration process, driven by socio-economic factors, has taken place during the conflict period. Second, there is also evidence that security considerations, such as the presence of police in a village or neighborhood, were either emigration-reducing or immigration-inducing. Third, although the presence of ethnic Javanese has not been a primary cause of conflict incidence, their intimidation by the rebel movement has led to a significant outflow, primarily from conflict-affected villages in Central Aceh. These results reveal that, beside a conflict-induced fear of violence, population movements in Aceh have also been an outcome of traditional migration determinants.",

            "abstract": "\n Refugee response has become an important topic in economic-development policy, but the majority of macro-level analyses do not find an association between country income level and refugee numbers. We argue that the apparent lack of association stems from using the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 count of refugees as the dependent variable in these analyses. Refugee counts reflect processes that take place in countries of arrival. In contrast, the decision to seek asylum may be more closely linked to conditions, including income, in countries of origin. Drawing on the \u2018migration-hump\u2019 concept from economic migration, we model counts of refugees and asylum seekers from conflict-affected countries for the same time period and find that differences in the level of gross domestic product (GDP) predict\u00a0new asylum applications but not new refugee numbers. We outline reasons for this statistical finding, and discuss theoretical and practical consequences for our understanding of the relationship between country income and asylum-seeking.",

We argue that the prediction of conflict severity needs to focus on the actors that are responsible for conducting armed violence. Hence, we predict the severity of conflict in government-rebel organization dyads. Our predictors focus especially on rebel organization characteristics, behavior, and the conflict networks actors are embedded in. Our statistical learning approach relies on random forests to predict the severity of conflict. We demonstrate that our model performs especially well distinguishing high levels of severity from very low levels.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Where societies display sufficient resilience to global and diffuse risks they are able to avoid tipping-over into governance breakdown and violent conflict. Similarly, if external actors such as the EU wish to build resilience in Europe\u2019s volatile neighbourhood, they require a systematic understanding of global and diffuse risks and tipping-points in order to develop long-term resilience-building strategies. But how should global and diffuse risks and tipping-points be conceptualized and understood? How can policy-makers anticipate global and diffuse risks to avoid governance breakdown and violent conflict in areas of limited statehood? This article addresses these questions. First, it argues, it is only by systematically integrating global and diffuse risks into explanatory logics of governance breakdown and violent conflict that we can develop better predictive models and resilience-building strategies. Second, it articulates a six-cluster typology of global and diffuse risks. Lastly, it demonstrates that in areas of limited statehood societies confront three distinct types of tipping-points that can overwhelm societal resilience. EU early-warning and resilience-fostering policy ought to distinguish between them and prepare to address each type.",

            "abstract": "A large body of research now indicates that climate likely matters for conflict. This climate\u2013conflict scholarship, however, has involved divergent findings, sometimes strident disagreement, and resulting limits to the usability of the scholarship for policymakers and practitioners. This viewpoint essay draws from recent expert assessments of climate\u2013conflict linkages to position the research field among climate change research and assessment more broadly. We explore potential insights from the climate realm. As is often the case for climate change research, science\u2013society dynamics are inherent in scholarship on climate and conflict. They contribute to contestation about the state of knowledge, the best ways to characterize it, and its implications for societal choices and investments. Our critique is grounded in the literature evaluating policy-relevant climate change assessment across diverse disciplines, from sea-level-rise adaptation science to energy-system modeling. Through comparisons with such fields, this perspective article considers several implications for climate\u2013conflict knowledge production. We examine, in particular, the necessity of integrating diverse lines of evidence to understand the risks of responding to societally relevant uncertainties and priorities, and of encouraging interactions among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The experiences of other climate change disciplines can provide inspiration for potential directions for climate, conflict, and security scholarship. They include risk framings in integrating underlying evidence, through to options for supporting the interactions among researchers and societies.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, several efforts have been made to project armed conflict risk into the future. One arising technique is the use of machine-learning (ML) models. In this study we explore its opportunities to project sub-national armed conflict risk for three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) by 2040-2050 in Africa, using the novel and open-source ML framework CoPro. Results are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with RandomForest classifiers agree with comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low or absent in most regions, although the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk intensifies in the more severe SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in central Africa and large parts of western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydroclimatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited but can differ locally depending on the overall sign of climate change impact and the contextual (socio-economic) factors defining the overall magnitude of those impacts. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we have identified various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the inconsistent data availability of observed conflict events as well as of socio-economic indicators for the various SSPs. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.",

            "abstract": "Author(s): Turchin, Peter; Gavrilets, Sergey; Goldstone, Jack A. | Abstract: Three predictive problems bedevil our ability to foresee political crises and state breakdown: (1) how to tell when a previously stable state falls into a situation of hidden but dangerous instability; (2) how to tell, once a certain level of instability has appeared in the form of protests, riots, or regional rebellions, whether chaos will grow and accelerate into revolution or civil war, or if the protests are likely to be contained and dampen out; and (3) how to tell which individuals and groups are likely to be the main source of mobilization for radical movements, and whether opposition networks will link up, grow and spread, or be isolated and contained. Prior work has focused on each of these problems separately. However, all three issues are crucial to understanding and foreseeing conflict dynamics. These issues operate on different time-scales and require separate models. In this article we discuss how better models of each process could be developed and, crucially, integrated with data for a more effective prediction system. A major theoretical challenge for us is to link these different approaches in order to increase their predictive power. A major empirical challenge is to identify data (direct or proxy) that can be used to parameterize, validate, and test our models.",

The study of collective human dynamics, including collective aggression, has been the focus of much discussion in the context of modeling and identification of universal patterns of behavior. In contrast, the possibility that civil unrest activities, across countries and over long time periods, are governed by universal mechanisms has not been explored. Here, records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919\u20132008 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks. The results also expose the similarity between global social instability and the dynamics of natural hazards and epidemics.",

Modeling Social Pressures Toward Political Instability. Cliodynamics 4: 241\u2013280. Modeling Social Pressures Toward Political Instability Peter Turchin University of Connecticut Structural-demographic theory is a conceptual tool for understanding and explaining long-term social pressures that can lead to revolutions, civil wars, and other major outbreaks of sociopolitical instability. This article develops a general modeling framework for quantifying such structural pressures toward instability. Following the basic premises of the structuraldemographic theory, the approach adopted here decomposes pressures toward instability into three components, dealing with the general population, elites, and the state, respectively. Several feedback loops affecting the dynamics of these components are modeled explicitly, including the effect of labor oversupply on real wages and on elite overproduction. I apply the modeling framework to two empirical case studies: investigating structuraldemographic dynamics during the nineteenth century (with a focus on the period preceding the American Civil War) and during the twentieth century (with a focus on the contemporary period).",

            "abstract": "Faith-based actors are often recognised as contributors to both conflict and peace. However, their work to prevent violent conflict, rather than bring an end to or recover from it, is largely unexplored. This is despite the growth of conflict prevention as a global social norm and field of practice. Based on collaborative research with faith groups and organisations in Nigeria, the Solomon Islands and Zanzibar (Tanzania), this paper examines faith-based forms of violent conflict prevention. It argues that faith-based approaches exist on a spectrum, from instinctive and ad hoc initiatives run by individuals and local places of worship to large-scale, systematised interventions led by global faith-based development organisations. Yet, while faith-based approaches to violent conflict prevention vary in form and function, they are consistent and distinctive in their emphasis on building resilient relationships at the local level, modelling forms of prevention embedded within local culture and that recognise the emotional and spiritual dimensions of transformative change. Faith-based approaches offer insights valuable to the wider conflict prevention field, which is increasingly critiqued for its liberal underpinnings and emphasis on technical and technological solutionism. Lessons emerge for others implementing prevention programmes, who could adapt elements of the unhurried, values-led, relationally sensitive approach demonstrated by some faith-based actors, albeit within their own structural limitations. Policymakers should support such adaptations and expand their view of prevention to explicitly include faith-based forms of activity, as to do otherwise risks missing opportunities and reproducing existing failures.",

Using a new methodology we find moderate support for a Pareto-type distribution (power law), considering data from different sources (COW and UCDP) and periods. A power law is a plausible model for the size distribution of a pool of all wars and a sample of wars in many years, although the log-normal distribution is a plausible alternative model that we cannot reject. The random growth of conflicts could generate both types of distribution. We study the growth rates of battle deaths and random growth cannot be rejected for most of the distribution, although the results also reveal a clear decreasing pattern; the growth of deaths declines faster if the number of initial deaths is greater.",

            "abstract": "Processes of coalescence and fragmentation are used to understand the time-evolution of the mass distribution of various systems and may result in a steady state or in stable deterministic or stochastic cycles. Motivated by applications in insurgency warfare we investigate coalescence-fragmentation systems. We begin with a simple model of size-biased coalescence accompanied by shattering into monomers. Depending on the parameters this model has an approximately power-law-distributed steady state or stochastic cycles of alternating gelation and shattering. We conduct stochastic simulations of this model and its generalizations to include different kernel types, accretion and erosion, and various distributions of non-shattering fragmentation. Our central aim is to explore the robustness of the steady state and gel-shatter cycles to these variations. We show that an approximate power-law steady state persists with the addition of accretion and erosion, and with partial rather than total shattering. However, broader distributions of fragment sizes typically vitiate both the power law steady state and gel-shatter cyclicity. This work clarifies features shown in coalescence/fragmentation model simulations and elucidates the relationship between the microscopic dynamics and observed phenomena in this widely applicable interdisciplinary model type.",

Two different interpretations have persisted: the notion that power laws are spurious results of random processes and the opposing view that power-law distributions attest to endogenous dynamics linked to self-organized criticality (SOC). We substantiate the SOC forest-fire model for intrastate conflicts, conceptualizing conflict potential as social pressure, measured by horizontal inequality. This potential is triggered by infinitesimal events. Their occurrence depends on the interaction density between conflict actors, operationalized as the conjunction of state capacity and non-state governance. In a global analysis of 143 conflict dyads, we find that 40 conform to a power law and 33 to a stretched exponential distribution, the two outcomes predicted by the model. We find evidence that the forest-fire model is a plausible approximation of the dynamics of intrastate conflicts, accounting for both the conformity and the non-conformity to power laws.",

            "title": "Nonlinear Dynamic Models of Conflict via Multiplexed Interaction Networks",
            "abstract": "The risk of conflict is exasperated by a multitude of internal and external factors. Current multivariate analysis paints diverse causal risk profiles that vary with time. However, these profiles evolve and a universal model to understand that evolution remains absent. Most of the current conflict analysis is data-driven and conducted at the individual country or region level, often in isolation. Consistent consideration of multi-scale interactions and their non-linear dynamics is missing. Here, we develop a multiplexed network model, where each city is modelled as a non-linear bi-stable system with stable states in either war or peace. The causal factor categories which exasperate the risk of conflict are each modelled as a network layer. We consider 3 layers: (1) core geospatial network of interacting cities reflecting ground level interactions, (2) cultural network of interacting countries reflecting cultural groupings, and (3) political network of interacting countries reflecting alliances. Together, they act as drivers to push cities towards or pull cities away from war. Using a variety of data sources relative to 2002-2016, we show, that our model correctly predicts the transitions from war to peace and peace to war with F1 score of 0.78 to 0.92 worldwide at the city scale resolution. As many conflicts during this period are auto-regressive (e.g. the War on Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Narco War across the Americas), we can predict the emergence of new war or new peace. We demonstrate successful predictions across a wide range of conflict genres and we perform causal discovery by identifying which model component led to the correct prediction. In the cases of Somalia (2008-13), Myanmar (2013-15), Colombia (2011-14), Libya (2014-16), and Yemen (2011-13) we identify the set of most likely causal factors and how it may differ across a country and change over time.",

We systematically cluster conflict reports from a database of $10^5$ events from Africa spanning 20 years into conflict avalanches. Conflict profiles collapse over a range of scales. Duration, diameter, extent, fatalities, and report totals satisfy mutually consistent scaling relations captured with a model combining geographic spread and local conflict-site growth. The emergence of such social scaling laws hints at principles guiding conflict evolution.",

            "abstract": "The continent of Africa is infamous for its many social conflicts. Research in the dynamics of these conflicts can give us a better understanding and can be useful in preventing them in the future. In this study we model social conflicts in Africa as earthquake occurrences using the spatial-temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. The model parameters are estimated using a simulated annealing algorithm and the results are compared across four major geographical regions in Africa. Several model tests will be applied to study the performance of the model in capturing the dynamics of the social conflicts, as well as to detect similarities between earthquake and conflict catalogs. Finally, the estimated model is used to make a prediction for the amount of future large events and their locations. The results suggest that this model produces useful insights in identifying current, and predicting future conflict regions. In particular, the model predicted a cluster of large events in the Central Africa region which was not expected based on past events and we found that small conflicts can trigger larger conflicts easier in East Africa than in other regions.",

            "title": "Discrete Sequence Rule Models as a Social Science Methodology: An Exploratory Analysis of Foreign Policy Rule Enactment within Palestinian-Israeli Event Data",
            "abstract": "Existing formal models of political behavior have followed the lead of the natural sciences and generally focused on methods that use continuous-variable mathematics. In 2002, Stephen Wolfram produced an extended critique of that approach in the natural sciences, and suggested that a great deal of natural behavior can be accounted for using rules that produce discrete patterns. This paper reports some initial findings designed to apply this pattern-based method to political event data. We believe that discrete sequence rule (DSR) models can provide a new social science methodology that is capable of preserving the agential basis of social interaction, tracking multiple agents as they enact rules through behavior directed at one another, and capturing the evolution of such interaction over time. The core of this project is a new, publicly accessible Web-based tool designed for the visualization and analysis of event data patterns (http://www.nkss.org). Using event data on the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict generated by the TABARI automated coding program of the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) for the period 1979\u20132004, we perform an initial exploration of this methodology. Specifically, we identify patterned behavior for which specific rule use can be imputed, and then examine several agent-based rules, plus four \u201cmeta-rules,\u201d to parse Israeli\u2013Palestinian interaction over time. Face validity of the analysis is apparent, and we also find the qualitative historical record can be augmented through observation of rule enactment in the event stream. Several descriptive empirical applications are demonstrated, including moving totals and increasingly complex sequences of rule enactment that go beyond the simple variations on tit-for-tat responses. While this paper represents an exploratory analysis of the method, the results are promising enough to warrant further investigation beyond its use in thick description as demonstrated here, to ultimately include hypothesis generation and falsification.",

Of note, EMBERS has successfully forecast the June 2013 protests in Brazil and Feb 2014 violent protests in Venezuela. We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading off specific evaluation criteria. EMBERS also provides an audit trail interface that enables the investigation of why specific predictions were made along with the data utilized for forecasting. Through numerous evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of EMBERS over baserate methods and its capability to forecast significant societal happenings.",

            "abstract": "PS-I (Political Science-Identity) is an agent-based computer simulation platform originally developed to operationalize, refine, and test competing versions of constructivist identity theory. Based on an earlier prototype, the ABIR (Agent-Based Identity Repertoire) model, agents with repertoires of identities (or other potentialities) interact in localities of specifiable size and are influenced as well by cross-landscape values attached to particular identities. These values change over time, thereby simulating conditions in which individuals may express latent identities, or learn to use new identities, because of local pressures toward conformity and/or overall shifts in the relative attractiveness of presenting oneself as attached to one identity or another. Large batches of controlled virtual histories are used for comparative and statistical analysis. PS-I has been designed with two imperatives in mind: ease of deployment by users who know nothing of computer programming; and systematic correspondence between the algorithms for agent behavior and corroborated theoretical positions in political science and psychology. The non-technical user\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe user with no programming skillsc\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan PS-I, to build and execute sophisticated models of substantial academic and policy interest. PS-I thus differs very significantly from existing platforms complexions and governance patterns are now under development. The substantive problems of interest that triggered the development of ABIR and PS-I related to the crisis facing social scientists using constructivist theories of identity to understand patterns of mobilization, attachment, and conflict based on cultural, ethnic, religious, or other traits. Athough constructivist theory has been very successful in demonstrating the ineffectiveness of older \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primordial\u00e2\u20ac or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essentialist\u00e2\u20ac notions of political identity, and in showing that identities are, within limits, fluid, tradeable, manipulable, and multiple, scholars employing these theories have been much less successful in studying the conditions under which and the limits within which collective identities can be stabilized, destabilized, created, or destroyed. The paper illustrates use of PS-I to study the dynamics of identity politics in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153typical\u00e2\u20ac authoritarian Muslim Middle Eastern country subjected to globalizing pressures, religious mobilization, and conflict in culturally divided societies.",

Because we care about these matters, we try to advance procedures and theories about systematizing our observations and improving our skills of analysis. Recent developments in international relations have tended to (a) emphasize the exploration of more specific problems and testing of hypotheses with quantified data and (b) deemphasized the search for general theories of internation behavior. This trend appears to be undergoing slight modification for many reasons. Events contain useful information which permit a student of foreign policy to use events singularly or in the aggregate to study foreign policy outputs and inputs. A student of international systems uses events singularly or in the aggregate to study patterns, structures, and transformation. This research calls for continuously developing models and operational procedures which analyze these phenomena with faster and better numerical precision. The Conflict and Peace Data Bank Project is the contribution of myself, my students, and my colleagues to this effort.",

            "abstract": "Population-level societal events, such as civil unrest and crime, often have a significant impact on our daily life. Forecasting such events is of great importance for decision-making and resource allocation. Event prediction has traditionally been challenging due to the lack of knowledge regarding the true causes and underlying mechanisms of event occurrence. In recent years, research on event forecasting has made significant progress due to two main reasons: (1) the development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms and (2) the accessibility of public data such as social media, news sources, blogs, economic indicators, and other meta-data sources. The explosive growth of data and the remarkable advancement in software/hardware technologies have led to applications of deep learning techniques in societal event studies. This paper is dedicated to providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of deep learning technologies for societal event predictions. We focus on two domains of societal events: \\textit{civil unrest} and \\textit{crime}. We first introduce how event forecasting problems are formulated as a machine learning prediction task. Then, we summarize data resources, traditional methods, and recent development of deep learning models for these problems. Finally, we discuss the challenges in societal event forecasting and put forward some promising directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "Twitter is one of most popular Internet-based social networking platform to share feelings, views, and opinions. In recent years, many researchers have utilized the social dynamic property of posted messages or tweets to predict civil unrest in advance. However, existing frameworks fail to describe the low granularity level of tweets and how they work in offline mode. Moreover, most of them do not deal with cases where enough tweet information is not available. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes an online framework for analyzing tweet stream inpredicting future civil unrest events. The framework filters tweet stream and classifies tweets using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. After that, the weight of the tweet is measured and distributed among extracted locations to update the overall weight in each location in a day in a fully online manner. The weight history is then used to predict the status of civil unrest in a location. The significant contributions of this article are (i) A new keyword dictionary with keyword score to quantify sentiment in extracting the low granularity level of knowledge (ii) A new diffusion model for extracting locations of interest and distributing the sentiment among the locations utilizing the concept of information diffusion and location graph to handle locations with insufficient information (iii) Estimating the probability of civil unrest and determining the stages of unrest in upcoming days. The performance of the proposed framework has been measured and compared with existing logistic regression based predictive framework. The results showed that the proposed framework outperformed the existing framework in terms of F1 score, accuracy, balanced accuracy, false acceptance rate, false rejection rate, and Matthews correlation coefficient.",

            "abstract": "Social media has become an established platform for people to organize and take offline actions, often in the form of civil unrest. Understanding these events can help support pro-democratic movements. The primary method to detect these events on Twitter relies on aggregating many tweets, but this includes many that are not relevant to the task. We propose a multi-instance learning (MIL) approach, which jointly identifies relevant tweets and detects civil unrest events. We demonstrate that MIL improves civil unrest detection over methods based on simple aggregation. Our best model achieves a 0.73 F1 on the Global Civil Unrest on Twitter (G-CUT) dataset.",

            "abstract": "Predicting significant societal events and generating early warnings is a challenging and critical problem since it involves multiple societal factors, including economics, politics, environment, and culture. Civil unrest prediction tasks have thus far relied on manually curated data sources and heuristic features determined by human expertise. Furthermore, current research focuses on machine learning approaches which do not effectively use heterogeneous data sources reflecting sequential data. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive model which effectively exploits such data sources through LSTM networks. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 2 different datasets related to 2 countries to illustrate the effectiveness of our model. Our results show that 1) LSTM networks demonstrate outstanding performance for such tasks, outperforming baserate models and other machine learning approaches, 2) historical data is useful for predicting the near future (the next day), but other, dynamic data is necessary to accurately predict events with increased lead time (3, 5 or 7 days).",

Existing civil unrest prediction systems have so far relied on manually curated data sources and heuristic features determined by human expertise. Current research focuses on machine learning approaches which do not effectively use heterogeneous data sources reflecting varying time series data, and only pays little attention to unstructured text data. In this paper, we propose: (a) a novel approach to model structured and unstructured data, and (b) a predictive model which effectively exploits such data and predicts with increased lead time through LSTM networks.

We theorize that the presence of resource wealth moderates the effect of political exclusion. Ethnic groups subject to exclusion whose settlement area includes oil wealth are more likely to experience the onset of armed conflict than groups experiencing exclusion alone. We depart from the convention of cross-national analysis to examine subnational, geocoded units of analysis\u2014ethnic group settlement areas\u2014to better capture the impact of natural resource distribution. Using data on ethnic group political exclusion derived from the Ethnic Power Relations database and geo-coded indicators, we conduct a series of logistic regression analyses for the years 1946 to 2005. We find that exclusion alone increase the likelihood of conflict, while the presence of oil wealth further raises the risk of war.",

We argue that it can, but only in poorer states where oil revenues threaten to alter the balance of power between regimes and their opponents, rendering bargains in the present obsolete in the future. We develop our claims via a game-theoretic model of bargaining between a government and a rebel group, where decisions over war and peace occur in the shadow of increasing oil wealth that both increases national wealth and shifts relative power in the government's favor. To test the model's main hypothesis, we leverage data on newly discovered oil deposits as an indicator of the state's expected future power resources. Our argument has important implications for the literature on credible commitments, power shifts, and violent conflict.",

            "abstract": "Thus far, researchers working on ethnicity and resources as determinants of civil conflict have operated largely independently of each other. While there is plenty of evidence that natural resources may spur armed conflict, empirical evidence for the nexus between ethnic fractionalization and conflict remains inconclusive. Some authors conclude that ethnically fractionalized societies are actually spared from intrastate violence. Others find either a positive relationship or none at all between ethnic fragmentation and internal conflict. In this context, this paper serves two purposes: first, it shows that salience-based fractionalization indices are associated with a higher risk of ethnic conflict onset; second, it finds evidence that oil further increases the conflict potential within fractionalized countries. The combination of oil and a shared identity seems to help overcome the collective action problems associated with rebellion, by providing recruitment pools, strong motives and the necessary financial means for insurgency. Employing logit models for pooled time-series cross-sectional data, our quantitative analysis shows that various ethnic fractionalization indicators are robustly linked to a substantially increased risk of ethnic armed conflict onset in a subset of oil-abundant countries.",

            "abstract": "What explains the effect of external intervention on the duration of civil war? The literature on intervention has made some progress in addressing this question, but it has been hindered by an assumption that states intervene in civil wars either to help one side win or to facilitate negotiations. Often, however, external states become involved in civil war to pursue an agenda which is separate from the goals of the internal combatants. When states intervene in this fashion, they make wars more difficult to resolve for two reasons. First, doing so introduces another actor that must approve any settlement to end the war. Second, external states generally have less incentive to negotiate than internal actors because they bear lower costs of fighting and they can anticipate gaining less benefit from negotiation than domestic insurgents. Through Cox regressions using data on the goals of all interventions in civil wars since World War II, this article shows that when states intervene with an independent agenda, they make wars substantially longer. The effect of independent interventions is much larger than that of external interventions generally, suggesting that the established finding that external interventions prolong civil war is driven by a subset of cases where states have intervened in conflicts to pursue independent goals.",

            "abstract": "This article argues that, contrary to received wisdom, political corruption is not necessarily associated with a higher risk of civil war in oil-rich states. Political corruption can be used to accommodate opposition and placate restive groups by offering private privilege in exchange for political loyalty. Since oil wealth is associated with large rents accruing in state treasuries, it provides an economic foundation for such clientelist rule. This article thus argues that oil-rich governments can use political corruption to buy support from key segments of society, effectively outspending other entrepreneurs of violence. Based on a logit analysis of civil war onsets, 1985\u201499, the article finds support for this `co-optation argument'. A negative and statistically significant interaction term between oil production and political corruption is consistent across different models and robust to a number of specifications. While both variables per se increase the risk of conflict overall, higher levels of corruption seem to weaken the harmful impact of oil on the risk of civil war. This finding suggests the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between natural resource wealth, governance and armed conflict. Political corruption has prolonged poverty and bred economic and political inequality in many oil-rich states, but it has also helped cement powerful alliances with a stake in the continuation of the corrupt regimes.",

The theoretical model predicts when and how interdependence influences conflict, using exit costs to separate economic interdependence from less binding economic interaction. Analysis of the model suggests that when exit costs exceed an endurance threshold for at least one state, the threat of exit becomes a viable but limited bargaining tool. Exceeding this threshold increases low-level conflict as states use economic and diplomatic tools to resolve demands, but it decreases high-level conflict because states take advantage of more efficient means of dispute resolution. If the stakes are too high, however, exit costs fail to check conflict, and the economic relationship becomes an ineffective bargaining arena. Empirical analysis provides support for the hypotheses derived from the model.",

Openness, a common measure of integration, is conceptually problematic and yields inconsistent empirical results. Drawing on the concept of network centrality, I develop a network approach to integration, emphasizing three aspects of multilateral trade: breadth of trade ties, depth of trade ties, and commercial distance between nonpartners. I then extend the dyadic logics of the trade-conflict literature to the multilateral level, focusing on (1) theories that predict that trade reduces conflict, either by increasing opportunity costs or by creating signaling mechanisms, and (2) theories that predict that trade, especially when asymmetric, increases the political autonomy of states and thus encourages aggression. Extensive country-year analysis shows that, consistent with the first set of theories, network centrality unilaterally constrains aggression. More ...",

            "abstract": "What explains the emergence of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State as parties in civil wars? This study provides the first large-N analysis of this question, studying a sample of states in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, 2003\u20132020, contributing to ongoing debates among peace and conflict scholars about jihadist rebels in civil war. Theoretically, it is argued that higher levels of state repression and states\u2019 military capabilities should impact the preferences of local groups and increase the likelihood of a \u2018transnationalization\u2019. On the other hand, it is hypothesized that increases in bureaucratic state capacity should reduce the risk of such transnationalization. A series of penalized logistic regressions yield support for the hypotheses regarding state repression and bureaucratic capacity, but not military state capacity. The findings point towards the importance of bureaucratic capacity building as well as the potentially adverse consequences of excessively repressive counterterrorism strategies.",

            "abstract": "Large- N studies of civil war overwhelmingly consider the state-specific structural conditions that make conflict likely. Meanwhile, policymakers often ignore these factors and instead search for patterns among the behavioral triggers of violence. This article combines these approaches. I use conflict narratives from the International Crisis Group\u2019s CrisisWatch publications to cross-validate structural analyses of civil conflict and confirm the mechanisms that lead to outbreaks of violence in conflict-prone countries. I then correct for selection bias in the narrative data with an underlying model of conflict likelihood. I find that several indicators thought to be causally related to civil conflict do indeed continue to have an effect after selection. However, the narrative data overemphasizes both the importance of several low-intensity, separatist conflicts within developed democracies and the potential for conflict among oil-rich states. These analyses highlight the importance of combining structural, large- N analyses with qualitative assessments of conflict zones. My findings also provide support for a state-capacity explanation of conflict behavior.",

            "title": "How different are the correlates of onset and continuation of civil wars?",
            "abstract": "It is very common to analyse the factors associated with the onset and continuation of civil wars entirely separately, as if there were likely to be no similarity between them. This is an overstatement of the theoretical position, which has established only that they may be different (i.e. less than perfectly correlated). The hypothesis that the explanatory variables are the same is not theoretically excludable and is empirically testable, both for individual variables and for combinations of them. Starting from this approach yields a rather different picture of the factors associated with the continuation of civil wars, because the relatively small sample size means that confidence intervals on individual coefficients are wide in this case. It is shown here that country size, mountainous terrain and (in most datasets) ethnic diversity seem significant for the continuation of civil wars, starting from the null hypothesis that variables affect onset and continuation probabilities identically, rather than entirely independently. One variable that affects onset and continuation significantly differently is anocracy, which we find to matter only for onset. Civil war is more likely if it occurred two years previously, as well as one year previously, which indicates that wars are more likely to restart after only one year of peace, and also more likely to stop in their first year. The combined model strengthens the result that ethnic diversity matters (it is consistently significant across datasets, whereas it is not when onset is analysed separately), although in the UCD/PRIO dataset it is significant only for onset. By contrast, if continuation is analysed independently, virtually nothing is significant except a pre-1991 dummy and a dummy for civil war two years previously.",

See mdwardlab.com and predictiveheuristics.com Every month, predictions are generated using the CRISP model. Currently, CRISP forecasts rebellion, insurgency, ethnic and religious violence, as well as domestic and international crises. The CRISP is a suite of programs to aid CRISis Predictions. This report was created with CRISP package and the crisp.data.package version 2015.4.6 predictions identify onsets, as well as ongoing conflicts, and also provide estimates of the intensity of these events. To do so we construct (at least) three kinds of models for each event of interest. These models have a monthly time frame, and are applied to a population of 167 countries around the world. These include 1) an ensemble hierarchical model of whether an event of interest is present, 2) a count model of the number of incidences of conflict related to the event of interest, and 3) a split duration, event based model that generates an independent estimate of the onset of new events. This report highlights some of these predictions, made based on data up until February of 2015.

EMBERS is built on a streaming, scalable, loosely coupled, shared-nothing architecture using ZeroMQ as its messaging backbone and JSON as its wire data format. It is deployed on Amazon Web Services using an entirely automated deployment process. We describe the architecture of the system, some of the design tradeoffs encountered during development, and specifics of the machine learning models underlying EMBERS.

We assess to what extent information about the characteristics of the conflicting dyads and conflict history can be evaluated ex ante and improve our ability to predict when conflicts will see mediation as well as when peaceful solutions are more likely to follow from mediation. We justify that the information used to generate predictions through the model can be assessed ex ante, using the ongoing conflict in Syria as an example. Our results suggest that a two-stage model of mediation and success seems to do relatively well overall in predicting when mediation is likely to occur, but notably less well in predicting the outcome of mediation. This may reflect how ex ante observable structural characteristics are likely to influence willingness to mediate, while the outcome of mediation to a large extent will be influenced by unobservable characteristics or private information and how these are influenced by mediation. We discuss the usefulness of out-of-sample evaluation in studying conflict management and suggest future directions for improving our ability to forecast mediation.",

Given this additional factor it is possible to predict not only the time at which a war will occur, but also the level of hostility in the system necessary for war to occur. The model further indicates why some hostile interactions cycle in extended protracted conflict patterns while others shoot off to war.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT To prevent violent conflict and governance breakdown abroad, the European Union (EU) needs anticipatory analysis and preventive action at the EU and member state level that follow a coherent approach. The EU\u2019s resilience agenda can complement early warning risk analysis for prevention, but it is unclear to what extent it has been operationalized. We compare the role that resilience plays in crisis early warning in diplomatic services at the EU and member state level in France and Germany. Drawing on the literature on Europeanization and diffusion, we seek to explain different levels of convergence regarding a resilience approach in early warning at the levels of strategy, analysis and action. We find that the diffusion item\u2019s specificity, the number of sources and particular institutional contexts impact the resulting level of convergence. Member states see value in complementing risk analysis with a resilience perspective, but the EU has failed to provide a sufficiently clear source model. Our results contribute to the literature on EU foreign policy diffusion and coherence and show that the EU has not exhausted its potential to promote resilience as a tool for more coherent and effective conflict prevention.",

            "abstract": "A primary goal of social science research is to understand how latent group memberships predict the dynamic process of social network evolution. In the modeling of international conflicts scholars hypothesize that membership in geopolitical coalitions shapes the decision to engage in militarized conflict. Such theories explain the ways in which nodal and dyadic characteristics affect the evolution of relational ties over time via their effects on group memberships. To aid the empirical testing of these arguments, we develop a dynamic model of social networks by combining a hidden Markov model with a mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel that identifies latent groups underlying the network structure. Unlike existing models, we incorporate covariates that predict node membership in latent groups as well as the direct formation of edges between dyads. While prior substantive research often assumes the decision to engage in militarized conflict is independent across states and static over time, we demonstrate that conflict patterns are driven by states\u2019 evolving membership in geopolitical blocs. Changes in monadic covariates like democracy shift states between coalitions, generating heterogeneous effects on conflict over time and across states.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of large, geographically disaggregated data on armed conflict, protest and other forms of political violence has led to a substantial development of research avenues. It has also brought with it numerous problems, both in terms of management of data quality and assurance of consistency. Dataset authors are generally aware of shortcomings in the sources they use, and alert users to such limitations. Still, researchers have been slow to provide solutions to these problems, even where they are clearly stated by dataset authors, in many cases due to the computational costliness of the canonical solutions. One such major but mostly ignored problem is the presence of large amounts of \u201cknown geographically imprecise\u201d (KGI) or \u201cknown temporally imprecise\u201d (KTI) observations in important datasets. In the spatial domain (KGI), dataset authors typically alert to geographical imprecision for 20\u201340% of observations . We introduce a simple, multiple-imputation based technique to address this issue. We show that the resulting imputations are reasonabley precise, and that using the imputed data considerably improves out-of-sample predictive performance relative to excluding the imprecise observations. \u2217The authors would like to thank Stefan D\u00f6ring, Hanne Fjelde, Sophia Hatz, Kristian Petrova, David Randahl, Ida Rudolfsen, Eric Skoog, and Nina von Uexkull for helpful comments.

            "abstract": "The impact of inequality on the outbreak of intrastate armed conflicts or civil wars has recently attracted considerable interest in conflict research. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on inequality in the total population (vertical inequality), recent studies have analysed inequality between certain groups of people (horizontal inequality), and found that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of conflict onset. However, most of the recent studies on the inequality\u2013conflict nexus have focused on conflicts fought between ethnic groups. The relation between inequality and other (non-ethnic) categories of conflicts has attracted less attention. The present study aims to address this gap: it implements a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relation between inequality and popular rebellions, a subset of conflicts where mobilization transcends ethnic boundaries and hostilities involve popular participation. Based on a sample of 77 popular rebellions and new global data on vertical inequality in income and education, this study shows that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of popular rebellion onset. In addition, the study reveals that inequality proxies (income and education Gini indices) outperform proxies of the absolute level of income (GDP per capita) in the model of popular rebellion onset, suggesting that it is relative, not absolute, well-being that ultimately motivates people to rise up in arms.",

            "abstract": "Drawing on the literatures on elite transitions, factionalism and the new institutionalism, this paper hypothesizes that the stability of partially democratic and emerging democratic regimes is dependent on the willingness of elites to make credible commitments to cooperate and comply with democratic rules. That willingness (or lack thereof) can be signaled by the presence of cooperative or conflict-precipitating events and actions in the periods around elections. We identify and analyze a variety of intra-elite interactions and demonstrate that conflict-precipitating events significantly increase the odds of a democratic retreat in the months before or just after an election, while cooperative events can balance them and prevent retreat. Using event data collected from 40 low- and middle-income countries for two-year periods around national elections between 1991 and 2007 we show that the imbalance of conflict-precipitating over cooperative events is far greater in cases of retreat from democracy. Furthermore, international intervention and pressure had a negative relationship with democratic stability. A logistic regression model accurately identified democratic retreat in 79 percent of the cases examined. Factor analysis revealed several common patterns of intra-elite conflict that can lead to democratic retreat, or conversely, patterns of cooperative events that bolster democratic consolidation. Finally, the data strongly argues for a model of democratic development that depends on open-ended elite maneuvering and the emergence of elite agree- ments, rather than a model where strong prior institutional constraints determine elite actions.",

            "abstract": "Latent Dirichlet allocation models are a relatively new computational classification algorithm. In its standard application to document classification, the model assumes each document to be composed of a mixture of multiple, overlapping topics each with a typical set of words, and classification is done by associating words in a document with the latent topics most likely to have generated the observed distribution of those words. I apply this technique to the problem of political forecasting by assuming that the stream of events observed between a dyad of actors is a mixture of a variety of different political strategies and standard operating procedures (for example escalation of repressive measures against a minority group while simultaneously making efforts to co-opt the elites of that group). By identifying the dominant strategies being pursued at time t, one gets information that can be used to forecast likely patterns of interaction at a later time t + k. This approach is applied to event data generated for 29 Asian countries in the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System project for 1998-2010 to forecast the ICEWS conflict measures for rebellion, insurgency, ethno-religious violence, domestic political conflict and international conflict at a six month lead time, and to the Israel-Palestine and Israel-Lebanon dyads from the KEDS Levant data set for 1979-2009. In random samples balancing the occurrence of negative and positive outcomes on the dependent variable, LDA combined with a logistic model predicts with around 60% to 70% accuracy in in-sample evaluation in both data sets, and improves very substantially on the sensitivity of the classification compared with simple logistic models in full samples. A supervised version of LDA, however, does not provide much improvement over the unsupervised version, and shows some pathological behaviors. Some structure can be found in the factors, though more work is needed on this.",

            "abstract": "Existing works on diffusion fail to account for the incapacitating effects conflict events may have on the operational capability of the combatant sides and how these effects may determine the evolution of a conflict. I hypothesize that it is those events with losses on the state side that are likely to be associated with geo-temporal spillovers, whereas events with insurgency losses are less likely to be associated with future mayhem in their vicinity. To test my arguments, I first introduce a new, comprehensive and detailed event dataset on the long-running civil conflict in Turkey. The Turkish State\u2013PKK Conflict Event Database (TPCONED) includes the exact date and county-level location for the fatal events of the armed conflict between the Turkish state and the rebel organization PKK since its very beginning in 1984 with detailed information on combatant casualties. I then employ a split population bi-probit model which allows me to comprehensively depict the geotemporal evolution of the conflict by acknowledging, estimating and accounting for the variation in the underlying conflict proneness across locations as a latent variable that shapes the diffusion of events. The results of the statistical analyses offer support for my hypotheses and reveal that how events evolve over space and time is conditioned by the damages suffered by the combatant sides. I demonstrate the robustness of these results on a matched sample I obtain by employing the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) on the data.",

Can the provision of services also mitigate the conflict potential arising from climate change? If so, how broad must access be to become effective? We test how household access to improved water, sanitation, and electricity affects the probability of local conflict in nine drought-prone African countries. We use annual PRIO-GRID cells as the unit of analysis and model the probability of a grid-cell experiencing fatal armed conflict during local or proximate drought conditions. DHS data are used to calculate the percentage of households with access to specific services. We show that even relatively modest investments in reliable sanitation and water infrastructures enhance communities\u2019 ability to avoid getting drawn into violent conflict in response to rainfall shocks.",

We provide a new actor-centric approach to explicitly model strategic interdependence in multi-actor civil wars. We argue that rebel organizations have incentives to remain mobilized until the end of a conflict to maintain their power to negotiate, power to spoil, power to enforce, and power to protect. This induces strategic complements that dominate duration dynamics in multi-actor conflicts. Based on a network game-theoretic model, we derive a spatial econometric framework that allows for a direct test of strategic interdependence. We find that the estimated duration interdependence is positive but partially offset in secessionist conflicts where the public goods nature of the incompatibility also induces strategic substitution effects.",

Similar geographical characteristics, resource endowments, and climatic conditions, may favor conflict simultaneously in neighbor countries. Moreover, civil conflict in one country often spills over to neighboring countries. The empirical literature usually considers these two explanations separately. We propose a model of the contagion of civil wars, which suggests that the risk of contagion has an impact of domestic features of a neighbor. In particular, a government can prevent contagion through investment in better institutions. This channel is the source of a strategic complementarity between the institutions of neighboring countries. This explains a pattern of clustering of countries according to their institutions, and suggests that contagion effect may have been underestimated by the empirical literature.",

            "abstract": "Civil conflicts spill over into neighboring countries. This paper proposes a theory of the contagion of civil wars. Weak territorial control facilitates the emergence of a regional market for war inputs in the \u201cporous frontier.\u201d The contagion effect is nonlinear and creates multiple equilibrium situations of regional complexes of civil conflicts. This helps explain the observed patterns of regional clustering of conflict and institutional quality, and raises identification issues in the measurement of the contagion effect. We also derive a positive spillover of civil wars: governments are sometimes in a position to avoid contagion by improving their institutions. Finally, we explore the policy implications for military intervention, and military and institutional cooperation.",

            "abstract": "Despite the surge in quantitative research examining the link between climate variability and conflict, a lot of uncertainty exists concerning whether there is a link. One shortcoming of the current literature is that it focuses mainly on statistical inference in order to establish causation with little attention for the predictive performance of the model. In contrast, this study extends the current literature by focusing on the predictive accuracy of a model linking droughts to communal conflict using data for Nigeria for the period 2006-2014. Using a number of different model specifications and estimation methods to test the robustness of the results, the analysis shows that although the regression results show a positive link between the occurrence of droughts and communal conflict, the predictive accuracy of the model is relatively low. In contrast, accounting for the temporal and spatial dynamics of conflict leads to better forecasts compared to the climate variable.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Civil war peace agreements are prone to collapse. While some research suggests that multiple layers of power-sharing provisions lead to more viable agreements, others have suggested that negotiated settlements are not only more likely to return to violence, but that those cases will be more deadly as a result. We suggest here that previous research has failed to address the various ways that peace agreements emerge and that this context is crucial in explaining peace agreement viability. In some situations, rebels are likely to earn those concessions through battlefield success. Governments may feel compelled to address underlying grievances in order to stop the bloodshed and ultimately maintain some political clout in the postwar regime. In other cases, however, governments may feel pressure to engage in discussions and to provide concessions by outside actors, whether in the form of diplomatic intervention, economic, or foreign military intervention. Hypotheses are tested on all civil war peace agreements identified by the UCDP Peace Agreement Data-set for 1975\u20132011. Findings from logit and hazard models suggest that agreements brought about in the aftermath of military intervention on behalf of rebels are more likely to endure while those earned on the battlefield (i.e., stronger rebels) do not. In addition, mediation enhances peace agreement viability, while interventions on behalf of governments tend to undermine it.",

            "abstract": "Theories of observational learning and the effects of reputation formation on future conflict interactions have been applied much more steadily to interstate conflict than to civil conflict. Yet, many nations have multiple civil wars with multiple warring dyads, offering groups ample opportunities to watch and learn from prior interactions between other rebel groups and the government. When a government keeps the promises it made to the signatories in a previous negotiated agreement, we argue that the risk of subsequent challenges from other non-signatory groups declines as these groups update their beliefs about that government and the efficacy of violent versus non-violent mobilization. In our analysis of the implementation of comprehensive peace accords since 1989, we found that governments that kept their implementation commitments to the signatory group(s) in a negotiated settlement experienced fewer armed challenges from other armed groups in the future.",

It remains unclear, however, whether this clustering is a result of contagion or of unobserved shocks that are correlated across space. We present new evidence for contagion by exploiting a natural experiment that increased the intensity of one conflict but had no direct effect on a second ongoing conflict in the same area. In particular, we analyze a ruling by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which disallowed a proposed peace treaty with the Moro-Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a Muslim separatist insurgency, and led to an escalation of conflict with the MILF in provinces with a large Muslim population. Though the ruling had no direct bearing on the conflict with the New People's Army (NPA), a communist guerrilla group, we find that it also led to a substantial increase in conflict with the NPA in the same provinces. We test several mechanisms and conclude that contagion was most likely the result of strategic escalation by the NPA in an attempt to exploit the local weakness of the armed forces.",

            "title": "Rare Events in International Relations: Modeling Heterogeneity and Interdependence with Sparse Data",
            "abstract": "The interdependence of international events is obvious to even casual observers of global politics. History is replete with examples of events repeating within states and/or being influenced by outcomes in other states. Despite this, much of the current literature in International Relations either mishandles or outright neglects this dependence, thereby threatening the credibility of our inferences. In large part, this stems from the difficulty of modeling such dependence when one's data are binary and rare, as they often are for many of the most widely-studied phenomena in IR (e.g., violent conflict, economic crises, etc\\ldots). For data of this type, commonly-used strategies to capture dependence are frequently ill-suited and, as such, new approaches are required. Therefore, this thesis aims to clarify the empirical challenges which arise from these data, detail the problems with existing approaches, and offer alternatives which should be preferred. \n \nThe focus is principally on two potential (and related) sources of bias which may arise within binary time-series cross-sectional (b-TSCS) data: true (inter-)dependence and unit heterogeneity. In the first, the outcomes, actions, and/or choices of some unit-times depend directly on those of other unit-times. To model both spatial and serial dependence in such data, a spatiotemporal-lag probit model estimated using maximum-simulated-likelihood using recursive-importance-sampling (MSL-by-RIS) is presented. This allows us to directly model the dependence of the lagged-latent outcomes, which is shown to have several advantages over models using the observed indicator (e.g., model consistency, effects estimation, predictive accuracy). The second main focus is on the threat of unobserved unit heterogeneity, that is, when time-invariant unit-characteristics influence the outcome, action, choice, but go unmodeled. While fixed effects estimators are traditionally the solution to this issue, such models have received heavy criticism in political science applications with b-TSCS data. In light of these criticisms, a penalized-maximum-likelihood fixed-effects (PML-FE) model is proposed which suffers from few of these drawbacks and permits the estimation of novel unit-specific substantive effects. In addition, original analyses into intrastate conflict and financial crises are offered to highlight the value of these approaches for testing existing, and motivating new, theories of international behavior.",

            "abstract": "This essay reviews diffusion as studied in large- N civil war research. In doing so, a number of pitfalls and lacunae are identified. First, the definition of diffusion as a process\u2014whereby internal conflict in one location alters the probability of internal conflict erupting in another location at a later point in time\u2014entails a number of difficulties for empirical modeling. Researching such a process involves an attempt to study a phenomenon that, in essence, is unobservable. It also creates difficulties in identifying relevant units of analysis, because the process involves at least two units. Second, diffusion is customarily identified based on correlations within a spatial and temporal proximity. Classifying it in this way risks simultaneously over- and underestimating cases of diffusion, which in turn generates uncertainty regarding the main determinants of diffusion. With these observations in mind, this essay ends with a word of caution for policymakers, with relevance extending beyond diffusion of civil war.",

In an attempt to achieve this objective, the role played by geopolitical factors in the Arab world's internal conflicts was investigated. More specifically, we used Kohonen self-organizing maps, an artificial intelligence-based neural network technique, along with event duration models to investigate the role played by distance from the capital, access to international borders, terrain, valuable natural resources such as oil, and rebels fighting capability in civil wars in the Arab world. Using recently validated data spanning more than 50 years of Arab civil wars (1948\u20132003), our findings indicate that previously ignored geopolitical factors seem to play an important role in the duration of internal conflicts in the Arab World.",

These hot spots identify spatial and temporal correlations in the territorial dispute data and therefore serve as close proxies for regional or neighbourhood instability. The addition of these hot spots also eliminates a common form of omitted variable bias \u2013 the spatial clustering of conflict \u2013 in international conflict models. These results confirm that joint democracy is only statistically significant as a predictor of fatal militarized interstate disputes in more peaceful neighbourhoods once territorial hot spots are jointly estimated.

            "abstract": "Various forms of violence plague our society. While violence is ubiquitous, there is a lack of studiesthat analyze war upsurges in a more dynamic and disaggregated setting, study its relationship withthe country attributes, and its impact on the broader population. In Chapter 1 I build a conceptualframework to analyze violence upsurges in a more dynamic and disaggregated setting. Using thedata on the Maoist insurgency in Nepal (1996-2006), I propose a model that conceptualizes violenceas a spatial-temporal process. I nd that the key determinant of whether or not an area is drawninto a civil war is its proximity of the areas that are already engaged in the civil war. In Chapter 2,I exploit a unique set of education data from Nepal to assess the impact of violence on an importantdeterminant of future economic growth: children's educational attainment. I find that 3 additionaldeaths per 10,000 population (one standard deviation) from the mean reduces the primary andsecondary school examination passing rates by 0.55 and 0.53 standard deviations, respectively.Lastly, in Chapter 3 I present a scenario where differences in a government's innate ability leadsto differences in resulting violence. More specifically, I present a scenario where the inability ofthe government to fully comprehend the ramifications of their actions leads to underinvestment incounterinsurgency. A fully informed government is aware of the breath of consequences of its actionsand takes stringent action accordingly, whereas a myopic government engages in ad hoc responsesonly. I find that if having a revolution is a greater concern, a myopic government facilitates it,whereas, if government's use of violence is as undesirable, a myopic government is preferred. Theoverall conclusion is that an armed conflict within a country has specific characteristics that need tobe further examined with disaggregated data and tested against the economic theories on institution formation. Additionally, an armed conflict also has far-reaching consequences for a warring state's next generation, thereby making policies to address the loss in human capital a necessity to prevent future conflict relapses.",

            "abstract": "The collapse of Mobutu\u2019s Zaire and the arrival of father and son Kabila regimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (hereafter, the DRC) were hastened by the dramatic and tumultuous spread of violence from neighboring Rwanda. Mobutu\u2019s state\u2019s inability to manage the influx of Hutu refugees (with Interahamwe militia members interspersed) into the Kivu province of eastern Zaire from Rwanda\u2019s bloody genocide of 1994 or to compensate for the ratcheting up of their cross-border skirmishes with the Banyamulenge (Zairean Tutsi) population in 1996, exacerbated extant tensions and has since resulted in more than a dozen years of civil war. This example prompts us to ask: are countries with higher levels of state capacity better able to resist the spread of violence from neighboring territories into their own? The author argues that when falsely divided notions of spatial heterogeneity and dependence are interacted, contagion from neighboring conflicts becomes a risk of diminishing value for increasingly capable states. A model of civil war contagion affirms a conditional hypothesis, showing that state capacity modifies the likelihood that a state will become infected by a civil conflict occurring in neighboring territories.",

            "abstract": "Existing research has related civil war primarily to country-specific factors or processes that take place within individual states experiencing conflict. Many contemporary civil wars, however, display a transnational character, where actors, resources, and events span national boundaries. This article challenges the 'closed polity' approach to the study of civil war, where individual states are treated as independent entities, and posits that transnational factors and linkages between states can exert strong influences on the risk of violent civil conflict. Previous research has shown that conflicts in a state's regional context can increase the risk of conflict, but the research has not distinguished between different varieties of transnational linkages that may underlie geographic contagion, and it has failed to consider the potential influences of domestic attributes. The article develops and evaluates a series of hypotheses on how transnational factors can influence the risk of conflict and the prospects for maintaining peace in a conditional autologistic model, including country-specific factors often associated with civil wars. The results suggest that transnational linkages between states and regional factors strongly influence the risk of civil conflict. This, in turn, implies that the risk of civil war is not determined just by a country's internal or domestic characteristics, but differs fundamentally, depending on a country's linkages to other states.",

            "abstract": "In international politics, states learn from the behavior of other nations, including the reputations states form through their actions in the international system. This article presents a model of how states process this information and examines how this learning affects international conflict. The model builds off of cognitive balance theory and foreign policy learning models and breaks new ground in its ability to provide a contextual assessment of reputation in world politics. The article then investigates whether a dyad is more likely to experience conflict if at least one state has a reputation for hostility. This hypothesis is tested empirically across all dyads in the international system from 1817 to 2000. The results indicate that states do engage in this learning behavior and that the information generated by extra-dyadic interaction of states has a significant bearing upon the likelihood of dyadic conflict.",

            "abstract": "Interaction Interaction is the exchange of value or information between two parties. While trade, mail, and diplomatic ties transmit positive value, war and other forms of armed conflict are examples of the exchange of negative value. Interaction \u2013 positive as well as negative \u2013 is determined by opportunity, motive, and identity. An interacting party needs a motive to engage in interaction, such as the desire to gain, financially or otherwise. Secondly, a transaction must be practically feasible. Finally, each party needs to have sufficient identity or coherence to be considered as an actor. In order to join the European Union and NATO, for instance, the motivation to become a member is not sufficient. Cooperation also depends on the opportunity to join as determined by the good will of the organization and the right timing. The prospective member also needs to be identified as an actor. Greenland can leave the European Union, while Occitania cannot. Likewise, negative interaction, including the use of military force, is unrealistic unless all three factors are present. Features that promote peaceful interaction may also constitute a foundation for conflict. Various models of internal conflict are related to this three-factor model, whose origins are usually credited to Gurr (1970). In their work on interstate war, Most and Starr (1989, 23) posit that decisions to go to war require opportunity and willingness.",

            "title": "Civil War in the Shadow of Intervention",
            "abstract": "I argue that expectations of third-party intervention shape the decision to start a civil war. To assess the claim, I develop a theoretical model of onset and intervention and a subsequent statistical approach built on a predictive measure of intervention. Intervention expectations improve model fit and out-of-sample performance relative to a standard model and a similar model in the literature. Not all interveners are the same: major powers, rivals, neighbors, and coethnics play unique and quantifiable roles. More interestingly, intervention expectations did not play a uniformly important role throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and the end of the Cold War appears to have brought on a new intervention-onset process. Remarkably, intervention expectations seem to explain away the well-known effect of population on the onset of violence. These results suggest that the shadow of intervention looms large in powerful but nuanced ways. \u2217Thanks to the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, W. Allen Wallis Institute of Political Economy, the star lab, and the Institute for Humane Studies for generous support. Thanks in particular to Curt Signorino for guidance. This paper has benefitted from discussions with Jeff Arnold, Quintin Beazer, Inken von Borzyskowski, Mike Colaresi, Tyson Chatagnier, Kevin Clarke, Casey Crisman-Cox, Amanda Driscoll, Kevin Fahey, Mark Fey, Nisha Fazal, Hein Goemans, Phil Henrickson, Gary Hollibaugh, Brenton Kenkel, Hye-Sung Kim, Bethany Lacina, Jeff Marshall, Will Moore, Jonathan Olmsted, Kai Ou, Matt Pietryka, Amy Pond, Pat Regan, Chris Reenock, Brad Smith, Mark Souva, Randy Stone, and Susanna Supalla. It has also benefitted from presentations at the Midwest Political Science Association meetings and the Peace Science Society (International) meetings. Despite all this amazing support, the usual caveat applies. We often invoke third party intervention as a potential channel for civil order, as it may deter violence before it starts. But, it also might enable violence by offering opposition groups a lifeline or brutal dictators a safety net. My goal in this paper is to find out how, if at all, the shadow of intervention so affects the onset of civil war. Precisely, I provide below (1) a general, unified framework linking onset and intervention; (2) a statistical approach directly related to the theory; and (3) a predictive measure of intervention expectations. I then use these tools to argue for and provide evidence supporting the importance of the shadow of intervention. Previewing the results, a fair read of the evidence suggests the following: 1. Most fundamentally: the shadow of intervention matters. Intervention expectations significantly improve fit over a standard model. Lest the reader worry that the result only reflects overfitting, expectations also improve out-of-sample predictive performance (see Table 2, p. 18). On this second point, intervention expectations are among the most important predictors for onset (Table 5, p. 27), playing both direct and indirect (i.e. interactive) roles in ways that other common predictors do not. 2. Echoing Thyne (2009): accounting for the international environment allows for a more dynamic view of onset. Many country-level predictors of civil violence remain fixed over time (e.g. mountainous terrain, at least on our time frame!) or evolve slowly (e.g. population), often in a single direction. Conversely, intervention expectations ebb and flow (Figure 5, p. 21), which in turn lets them improve performance around the onset of violence (Table 3, p. 22). If (say) low incomes provide the kindling for war, then the international environment may shift quickly enough to create the spark. 3. Relatedly, the international environment did not play a uniformly important role in the second half of the twentieth century, and the baseline and internationalist models performed similarly during the 1940s\u20131950s. A spate of civil wars from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s seems to be well-explained by a decrease in the likelihood for intervention by superpowers (Figures 4 and 5, pp. 20\u201321). Intervention expectations played an especially important role after the end of the Cold War, reinforcing a point made by Kalyvas and Balcells (2010) (that the international system matters) but from a very different angle. 4. Strikingly, the internationalist approach calls into question the influence of long-cherished country-level predictors. The results severely weaken",

La litterature empirique dissocie habituellement ces deux explications. Nous proposons un modele de la contagion des guerres civiles qui illustre que certaines caracteristiques des pays sont affectees par le risque de contagion. En particulier, un gouvernement peut eviter la contagion en investissant dans la qualite de ses institutions. La complementarite strategique entre les institutions de pays voisins genere des regroupements de pays selon leur capacite etatique.

            "abstract": "While civil wars are by definition armed conflict within a nation state, the conflicts and their effects are rarely if ever confined within the boundaries of a single nation state. This chapter categorizes the transnationalism of civil wars along three dimensions: clustering, contagion, and connectedness. First, civil wars are clustered in space due to shared regional characteristics that make conflict more or less probable depending on geographical location. Such clustering of conflicts may manifest itself even when conflicts are not causally related. Second, the occurrence of civil war in one state may increase the risk of civil war in neighboring nations through contagion effects. Such contagion may take place through direct spillover of, for instance, refugee flows and arms transfer or through more indirect processes of strategic learning and inspiration. Third, civil wars in different countries may be connected by shared grievances, collaboration between rebel groups, and emerging war economies. In the extreme form, such interconnectedness results in regional conflict complexes that may prove intractable. The chapter proceeds to discuss how these transnational dimensions of civil war impact on the duration and outcome of conflicts. The chapter ends by identifying some of the remaining knowledge gaps.",

            "abstract": "Although refugees are victims of conflict and forced to leave their homes, they can cause negative externalities in asylum states, such as a disturbed ethnic balance and the diffusion of rebel networks. In order to avoid further aggravations of humanitarian crises, it is crucial to understand and control these mechanisms. This dissertation analyzes the mechanisms of how refugees trigger conflict and thereby contributes to the knowledge of conflict diffusion. The existing conflict literature has found a statistically significant correlation between civil conflict diffusion and refugees, but it fails to explain how refugees influence conflict. In contrast to previous research, the new theoretical approach to refugee-related conflict introduced in this dissertation considers ethno-nationalist preferences of refugee flows and asylum countries. Both transnational ethnic groups and refugee movements have been identified as important actors contributing to civil conflict spread, but the systematic effect of the ethnicity of refugees has so far been ignored. Therefore, I introduce a new quantitative dataset on the ethnicity of refugees with global coverage. The three quantitative chapters of this dissertation analyze the direction of refugee movements, the relationship between refugees and the population in the receiving state and the relationship between refugees and insurgent groups. Finally, the quantitative findings are complemented with qualitative evidence from the Kosovo refugee crisis in 1999. In the first part of this dissertation, I theorize that the asylum destination of refugees is strongly determined by trans-border ethnic linkages. Building on qualitative research of migration that has found that migration movements follow well-defined trends, I assume that the direction of refugee movements is not random. I develop a theoretical model, which includes spatial, temporal and cultural pull factors, and conduct the first systematic examination of the flight direction of refugees. The results indicate that many ethnic refugee groups flee to nearby countries with ethnic kin populations and a history of accepting other co-ethnic refugees. Thus, subnational refugee characteristics, such as ethnicity, are essential to understanding the movement patterns of refugee flows. The second part investigates how the political power status of the local kin group affects the risk of conflict after a co-ethnic refugee influx. Ethnic kinship between refugees and the host population usually facilitates acceptance. However, qualitative studies have found that ethnic kin refugees can have a negative effect in multi-ethnic states, because they threaten ethnic stability. Further, we know very little about the systematic effect of ethnicity on security in refugee-receiving states. Therefore,",

            "abstract": "The spatial diffusion of violent conflict has been a major concern in recent literature on war. Specifically, students of international conflict have come to devote increasing attention to civil war and how various other forms of internal conflict disperse through a region. In this paper, we assess the effect of spatiality and distance on the proliferation of civil conflict and the prospects for diffusion of civil war either through clustering or contagion from state to state. We employ methods of spatial analysis, including join count statistics, to evaluate spatial dependence in the occurrence of civil war in the postCold War period, from 1991-2004. In addition to discerning the existence of dispersion in the incidence of civil war, our analysis moves toward allowing us to distinguish between clustering and contagion (and the effects of different measures of distance). Our findings provide evidence that domestic conflict does indeed spread through spatial dispersion. Paper presented at the conference, \u201cThe Spatial and Network Analysis of Conflict,\u201d September 25-27, 2008. An earlier version was presented at the 2007 Annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago. INTRODUCTION: THE DISEASE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES Over 35 years ago Norman Z. Alcock wrote The War Disease (1972). He developed a model that was based on the idea that because at least one war (interstate war, which was his concern) was taking place somewhere in the system, the various mechanisms based on the security dilemma and its attendant uncertainty and fear, would serve to generate more war among what we would now call \u201crelevant dyads.\u201d In this way, the \u201cwar disease\u201d would continue to spread within the social system of nationstates. One major theme that Alcock presented was the idea that war generated more war. He was, thus, concerned with the consequences of war. As one of the present authors noted that same year (Starr 1972), the study of international conflict was then (as it is now) heavily weighted toward the study of the causes of conflict, while much less attention was devoted to the consequences of conflict. However, the two areas of study are intimately connected in that one of the major consequences of conflict may be more conflict. This has been well demonstrated in the study of war (for two overviews see Most, et al. 1989, and Starr and Siverson 1998), looking at several forms of diffusion. More recently, students of civil war (e.g. Murdoch and Sandler 2004; Sambanis 2002; Gleditsch et al. 2008) have also been concerned with the consequences of civil war; (although, see also Starr 1994). Again, one of the most importance consequences of civil",

            "abstract": "Students of international conflict are increasingly aware of the potential problem of spatial dependence. Much of international behavior is linked spatially and temporally. Yet, many dyadic analyses of interstate interactions assume independence among units. Although there exist some technical and statistical solutions for addressing spatial dependence, directly modeling the dependence generating processes is more satisfying and intellectually informative. We consider how extra-dyadic linkages to a dispute dyad could give rise to new disputes. Alliances are designed to encourage third parties to join dyadic contests, but most existing empirical analyses consider only bilateral alliance ties as factors preventing conflict onset. Likewise, contests often extend to include new disputes involving third parties that are geographically close to, or in between disputants. We develop new data on extra-dyadic alliance ties as well as the \" inbetweenness \" of potential third parties' geographical location relative to conflict dyads. We show empirically that both of these linkages are strongly related to the risk of dispute onset, even while accounting for other purely dyadic factors. Our approach can be applied more broadly to address spatial dependence, and can be extended to address other spatial variables.",

            "abstract": "Tools for automated quantitative analysis of information are more and more required in the framework of early warning systems, to support political decision makers in making timely evaluations of the risk of severe crises. This report describes a scientifically sound approach to build a statistical model to assess quantitatively the risk of intra-state armed conflict in any country in the world. Our models are based on structural indicators, and they therefore make a static assessment of country level performance, which can then be ranked for conflict risk. The temporal trend provide additional information on the evolution of the situation. Attention is paid to operationalise this approach in early situation assessment.

            "title": "SPATIAL-TEMPORAL MODELING OF CIVIL WAR: THE EXAMPLE OF BOSNIA",
            "abstract": "We describe a spatially and temporally autoregressive discrete regression model, detail and implement an algorithm for estimating the parameters of such a model, following the framework of Geyer and Thompson (1992), as recently updated by Zhu, Zheng, Carroll and Aukema (2008); Zhu, Rasmussen, M\u00f8ller, Aukema and Raffa (2008); Zheng and Zhu (2008). This model is applied to geo-located data on attributes and conflict events in Bosnia over the period from March 1992 through October 1995. We present an R program library to estimate this class of models. Results show that there is a strong spatial as well as temporal dimension to the outbreak of civil conflicts in Bosnia, dynamics in space and time that standard OLS-type implementations completely miss. Using this approach it is no longer necessary to assume that either the spatial or the temporal dependencies in conflict data are exogenous in order to create predictive and inferential models of civil conflicts. Substantively, we show via inference, simulation, and animations that conflict events in Bosnia did diffuse spatially as well as temporally. 1. The Spatial-temporal Model Discrete spatial temporal data characterize most models of conflict, both at the international and domestic levels. The gold-standard approach in political science appears to focus on the temporal dependencies in such data, at the expense of the spatial dependence. In the fields of applied statistics, there are two general stepping off points for developing models of such data. One approach follows the model based geo-statistics approach found in Diggle, Moyeed and Tawn (1998) and uses a form of generalized linear mixed models to examine spatial dependencies among geo-located events. The spatial-temporal component is modeled by a Gaussian process that captures the dependencies via an autocorrelation function that embodies both spatial and temporal lags. A second approach follows from the breakthrough of Besag (1972, 1974) in using a lattice based framework for a Markov Random Field, which models the discrete outcome at one location conditional on the observed outcomes at neighboring locations. This approach\u2013known as autologistic regression\u2013was widely employed for decades by using a pseudo-likelihood approach (i.e., a normal logistic regression). The autologistic approach is fairly straightforward. We detail it formally herein. Let Yt = (Y1,t . . . YN,t) \u2032 represent whether there is a conflict on the observed spatial arrangement of units at time t; Yi,t is the existence of conflict at location i at time t.

We dissect the \"conflict breeds conflict\" truism into three hypotheses: (1) the present extent of conflict simultaneously determines its intensity, while the present intensity of conflict determines its future extent; (2) the present extent of protest determines the present extent of rebellion and vice versa; and (3) the extent and intensity of both protest and rebellion persist over time. Our principal findings are: (1) man-days of protest is a weak positive and linear function of simultaneous man-days of rebellion and lagged man-days of protest; (2) deaths from protest is a strong curvilinear function of simultaneous man-days of protest; (3) man-days of rebellion is a weak positive and linear function of simultaneous man-days of protest and lagged man-days of rebellion, and a U-shaped function of lagged deaths from rebellion; (4) deaths from rebellion is a strong exponential function of present man-days of rebellion, and a linear and positive function of lagged deaths from protest and from rebellion. We conclude that the self-generative model provides a less-than-sufficient explanation of variations in internal conflict.",

            "abstract": "This article describes some results of a successful attempt to assess and refine a causal model of the general conditions of several forms of civil strife, using cross-sectional analyses of data collected for 114 polities. The theoretical argument, which is discussed in detail elsewhere, stipulates a set of variables said to determine the likelihood and magnitude of civil strife. Considerable effort was given here to devising indices that represent the theoretical variables more closely than the readily-available aggregate indices often used in quantitative cross-national research. One consequence is an unusually high degree of statistical explanation: measures of five independent variables jointly account for two-thirds of the variance among nations in magnitude of civil strife (R = .80, R2 = .64). It should be noted at the outset that this study does not attempt to isolate the set of conditions that leads specifically to \u201crevolution,\u201d nor to assess the social or political impact of any given act of strife except as that impact is reflected in measures of \u201cmagnitude\u201d of strife. The relevance of this kind of research to the classic concern of political scholarship with revolution is its attempt at identification and systematic analysis of conditions that dispose men to strife generally, revolution included.",

            "abstract": "The problem of accounting for domestic political conflict, particularly in the less developed countries, has become an important global task. In the article, several conflict indicators are reviewed and embedded in a conceptual model. The regime's inability to provide economic and political goods is conceived as a source of discontent, or relative deprivation, within a population. This discontent is seen to be likely to result in conflict if the environment is conducive to the mobilization of resources for collective action. The validity of the indicators is tested with various techniques, including ordinary least squares, generalized least squares (error component), and Logit regression models, on a sample of 70 less developed countries in 1981-89. The dependent variables are (1) political conflict and its constituent parts, (2) political protest, (3) rebellion, and (4) irregular executive transfer. The overall extent of political conflict varies directly with poor economic performance, ethnic dominance, military centrality, urbanization and conflict tradition, inversely with the level of economic development, and is most extensive under middle levels of political authoritarianism. Economic performance seems to be more conducive to political protest and irregular executive transfer than rebellion. Urbanization and ethnic dominance are directly associated with political protest but decrease the likelihood of irregular executive transfer. The results generally corroborate the findings of 30 years of conflict research also in the Third-World context.",

            "abstract": "This paper surveys nearly two hundred scholarly works that use mathematical methods, which include stochastic models, difference and differential equation models, expected utility models, and various types of game theoretic models, to study domestic political conflict (DPC), which includes terrorism, guerrilla wars and insurrections. A citation count reveals that the DPC articles surveyed here cite less than three quarters of an article from within their own DPC modelling tradition and cite less than two articles from any DPC modelling tradition. The only exceptions to the rule that \u201cnobody cites nobody else\u201d are the stochastic and expected utility modelers. I conclude that the \u201cfield\u201d of formal models of DPC hardly exists: few authors read other authors, few articles cite other articles, few models build on other models. Several suggestions aimed at promoting greater accumulation in formal models of DPC are offered.",

We reconceptualize the linkage in terms of an interactive process model of changes in the grievances and resourcemobilizations of dissident movement and regime countermovement. Diachronic modeling is proposed as superior to the cross-sectional approach for unraveling dissent-repression interactions. Dynamic modeling techniques are employed to experiment with three linear \u201cmutuality models\u201d using the scope and intensity dimensions of dissent and repression. Our findings reveal significant similarities and differences among the models studied that would be difficult to intuit from conventional methods.

            "title": "Securing Whose Peace? The Effects of Peace-Agreement Provisions on Physical Integrity Rights After Civil War",
            "abstract": "When civil wars are resolved via negotiated settlement, peace-agreement provisions like power-sharing agreements and third-party security guarantees often are advocated for their purported benefits of ensuring a long-lasting and durable peace. Although scholars have explored the effects of peace-agreement provisions on enhancing the security of states, their influence on shaping individual security outcomes is largely unknown. The strong potential exists that these same provisions that improve a government\u2019s ability to deter future violence also increase that government\u2019s violation of its citizens\u2019 physical integrity rights as a means of coercion and governance. Also rare in the power-sharing literature is exploration of the effects of individual, disaggregated provisions. This dissertation, therefore, asks: Under what conditions do peace-agreement provisions significantly improve the state\u2019s protection of its citizens\u2019 physical integrity rights? Two models are proposed. Model 1 considers aggregated power-sharing provisions. Model 2 considers disaggregated peace-agreement provisions, and includes both power-sharing agreements and robust third-party security guarantees. Both models are evaluated in light of the situational and historical contexts relevant to each state\u2019s civil war experience. The universe of cases includes thirty-six civil wars in twenty-seven states where conflict terminated between 1989-2007 via negotiated settlement. This project leverages a mixed-method research design, including iii contingency tables and fuzzy-set Quantitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to resolve the \u201csmall number of cases, multiple variables\u201d challenge and to account for causal complexity. Four central claims are advanced in this dissertation: First, the common technique of evaluating peace-agreement provisions by aggregating them according to common political, military, and territorial dimensions obscures and misleads scholars; the disaggregation of peace-agreement provisions reveals how measures often act in opposition. Second, a number of commonly present provisions\u2014including integration of rebels into the main military ranks and the granting of territorial autonomy\u2014are consistently inhibitory to individual security after civil war ends. Third, other provisions such as robust third-party security guarantees and the granting of territorial federalism consistently lead to a reduction in the level of political repression used by states after civil war has ended. Fourth, significant human-rights improvement results from favorable causal recipes (i.e., combinations of disaggregated conditions) that together reduce both the motivation and opportunity of a government to repress. These findings will assist decision-makers involved in negotiated settlements, as they (1) identify the appropriate blends of peace-agreement provisions for resolving different civil wars, and (2) balance the need for a post-conflict government to both assure its population and to deter future violence.",

            "abstract": "AGENTS IN CONFLICT: COMPARATIVE AGENT-BASED MODELING OF INTERNATIONAL CRISES AND CONFLICTS David P. Masad, PhD George Mason University, 2016 Dissertation Director: Dr. Robert Axtell Inter-state conflicts are a key area of study in international relations, and have been approached with a variety of techniques, from case studies of individual conflicts, to formal analysis of abstract models and statistical investigations of all such conflicts. In particular, there are a variety of theories as to how states make decisions in the face of conflicts \u2013 such as when to threaten force, when to follow through, and when to capitulate to an opponent\u2019s demand. Some scholars have argued that states may be viewed as rational decisionmakers, while others emphasize the role of psychological biases a\u21b5ecting individual leaders. Decisionmaking is challenging to study in part because of its complexity: the decisionmakers may not just be individuals but organizations, following internal procedures and reflecting institutional memory. Furthermore, the decisions are often believed to be strategic, reflecting the decisionmakers\u2019 anticipation of multiple other actors\u2019 potential responses to each possible decision. In this dissertation, I demonstrate that agent-based models (ABMs) provide a powerful tool to address this complexity, and advance their use as a bridge between di\u21b5erent methodologies. Agents in ABMs, representing countries, can be endowed with a variety of internal decisionmaking models which can operationalize a variety of theories drawn from case studies, psychological experiments or game-theoretic analysis. The specific decision model agents utilize may be changed without altering the sub-models governing how the agents interact with one another. This allows us to simulate the same overall interactions utilizing di\u21b5erent decisionmaking theories and observe how the outcomes di\u21b5er. Furthermore, if these interactions correspond to real-world events, we may directly see how much explanatory or predictive power the outputs of the model variants provide. If one variant\u2019s outputs correspond closer to the empirical data, it provides evidence supporting that variant\u2019s underlying theory. I implement two agent-based models, extending well-established prior models of international conflict: the International Interaction Game (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman, 1992) and the Expected Utility Model (Bueno de Mesquita, 2002). For each, I start with their original agent decisionmaking models, and develop several variants grounded in relevant theories. I then instantiate the models with historic, empirically-derived data and run them forward to generate sets of simulated outcomes, which I compare to empirical data on the relevant time periods. I find that non-rational models of decisionmaking in the International Interaction Game provide similar explanatory power to the purely rational model, and yield rich satisficing behavior absent in the original model. I also find that the Expected Utility Model variant implementing a Schelling (1966)-inspired model of coercion yields richer dynamics and greater explanatory power than the original model. In addition to providing evidence in support of particular theories and hypotheses, this work demonstrates the power of the comparative modeling methodology in studying international conflict. Future work will involve adding more statistical controls to the model output analysis, comparative analysis between the outputs of the two overall models, and extension of the decisionmaking models for each. The same methodology may also be expanded to other formal and computational models of international relations, and social science more broadly. Chapter 1: Introduction",

Relationships identified to cause increased tension within the network are discovered and analyzed. Identifying this tension provides analysts with insight into the complexities of the network and potential relationships to target to stabilize or destabilize a network. Two Social Network Analysis models have been developed analyzing the relationships of key actors associated with the 2012-2013 conflict in Northern Mali. Relations between the terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), several Tuareg organizations, the Malian government and other key actors are assessed, both prior to and immediately following French and other international forces involvement beginning in January 2013. The potential effectiveness of the developed methodology is demonstrated, through the Mali example, in the identification of a specific relationship between two organizations as being under tension to change; subsequently one of the organizations split, reducing the tension and irreversibly changing the network.",

            "abstract": "Conflict forecasts are crucial to Combatant Commanders\u2019 understanding of the dynamic environment encompassing countries within their area of responsibility. The current structure of the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) is rooted in geography by grouping nations in geographic proximity to the same regional command. However, leaders today question the e\u21b5ectiveness of the current structure. A novel modified k-means clustering algorithm is developed and implemented that groups countries based on data similarities and geographic proximity resulting in new COCOM groupings that improve conflict forecasts. The data spans various political, military, economic, and social characteristics of countries, and is used to develop conditional logistic regression models that predict the likelihood of a country to transition into or out of conflict. Predictions from models using the original COCOM regions are compared to predictions from models using the new, data and geography based, regions. Reorganizing the COCOMs based on data similarity and geography improves conflict forecasting models and prediction capabilities significantly. The new models achieved training data classification accuracies exceeding 89% for each new COCOM and improved predicting the validation data with classification accuracies increasing up to 2% as compared to the current COCOM models and up to 2.5% in comparison to previous conflict studies. This methodology of grouping countries based on data similarities and geographic proximity leads to newly defined COCOMs which improve overall forecasting ability of conflict transitions, the best found in the literature to date. These results can help Combatant Commanders better understand the dynamic conflict environment of their area of responsibility and lead to the development of more e\u21b5ective operational and strategic plans.",

            "abstract": "External interventions in civil wars are a recurrent practice of the international community, executed through a series of mechanisms\u2014most notably, military, economic or diplomatic interventions (with UN and non-UN missions being a combination of these). Studies of these interventions have focused on how effective they are in stopping civil war or maintaining peace. Despite the focus of these studies on high intensity conflicts, the effect these interventions have on conflict intensity is still unclear. Additional studies have not appropriately controlled for the endogeneity of the relationship between interventions and conflict. Conflicts\u2019 characteristics attract interventions, and interventions influence conflict characteristics. Based on a balance of the capability model, this paper explores conflictintensity levels and conflict-intensity changes, with a new dataset on external interventions for Africa for the period between 1989 and 2010. The regression results, based on a zeroinflated negative binomial and logit models controlling for endogeneity, indicate that partisan, military and economic interventions increase conflict intensity whereas neutral and diplomatic interventions have no effect on conflict intensity. In fact, after controlling for endogeneity, successful or failed mediation is found to have no significant effect on conflict intensity. The conclusion is that more detailed research needs to be conducted to understand the unexpected effect of diplomacy and interventions\u2019 objectives.",

            "abstract": "Can wars be forecasted? A central difficulty is that warnings of a looming war tomorrow are likely to affect behavior today. Whether decision-makers attempt to prevent its onset or to hasten it, the initial forecast will no longer hold. Predictable conflicts will therefore tend not to occur, and only those that are difficult to forecast will. This endogeneity implies that the wars that we do observe will likely come as a surprise. We test this conjecture by estimating the risk of war as perceived by contemporaries of all inter- and intra-state conflicts between 1816 and 2007. Using historical data of government bond yields, we find that contemporaries indeed tend to underestimate the risk of war prior to its onset, and to react with surprise after its start. We also show that the forecasting record has not improved over the past 200 years, and that interstate wars and those involving democracies are more difficult to predict.",

            "title": "Early Warning of Conflict in Southern Lebanon using Hidden Markov Models",
            "abstract": "This paper extends earlier work on the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to the problem of forecasting international conflict. HMMs are a sequence comparison method widely used in computerized speech recognition as a computationally efficient method of generalizing a set of sequences observed in a noisy environment. The technique is easily be adapted to work with \\international event data. The paper provides a theoretical \"micro-foundation\" for the use of sequence comparison in conflict early-warning based on coadaptation of organizational standard operating procedures. The left-right (LR) HMM used in speech recognition is first extended to a left-right-left (LRL) model that allows a crisis to escalate and de-escalate. This model is tested for its ability to correctly discriminate between BCOW crisis that involve and do not involve war. The LRL model provides slightly more accurate classification than the LR model. The interpretation of the hidden states in the LRL models, however, is more ambiguous than in the LR model. The HMM is then applied to the problem of forecasting the outbreak of armed violence between Israel and Arab forces in south Lebanon during the period 1979 to 1997 (excluding 1982-1985). An HMM is estimated using six cases of \"tit-for-tat\" escalation, then fitted to the entire time period. The model identifies about half of the TFT conflicts\u2014including all of the training cases\u2014that occur in the full sequence, with only one false positive. This result suggests that HMMs could be used in an event-based monitoring system. However, the fit of the model is very sensitive to the number of days in a sequence when no events occurred, and consequently the fit measure is ineffective as an early warning indicator. Nonetheless, in a subset of models, the maximum likelihood estimate of the sequence of hidden Markov states provides a robust early warning indicator with a three to six month lead. These models are valid in a split-sample test, and the patterns of cross-correlation of the individual states of the model are consistent with theoretical expectations. While this approach clearly needs further validation, it appears promising. The paper concludes with observations on the extent to which the HMM approach can be generalized to other categories of conflict, some suggestions on how the method of estimation can be improved, and the implications that sequence-based forecasting techniques have for theories of the causes of conflict.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) methods have significantly improved their performance. However, more complex NLP models are more difficult to interpret and computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose an approach to dictionary creation that carefully balances the trade-off between complexity and interpretability. This approach combines a deep neural network architecture with techniques to improve model explainability to automatically build a domain-specific dictionary. As an illustrative use case of our approach, we create an objective dictionary that can infer conflict intensity from text data. We train the neural networks on a corpus of conflict reports and match them with conflict event data. This corpus consists of over 14,000 expert-written International Crisis Group (ICG) CrisisWatch reports between 2003 and 2021. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the weighted words from the neural network to build the dictionary. In order to evaluate our approach, we compare our results to state-of-the-art deep learning language models, text-scaling methods, as well as standard, nonspecialized, and conflict event dictionary approaches. We are able to show that our approach outperforms other approaches while retaining interpretability.",

To answer this question, I construct a unique, extremely disaggregated data set drawn from social media sources to examine the behavior of Israel and Hamas during the 2012 Gaza Conflict. The data set contains conflict actions and international audience behavior at the hourly level for the full 179 hours of the conflict. Notably, I also include popular support for each side from international audiences on social media. I employ a Bayesian structural vector autoregression to measure how Israel\u2019s and Hamas\u2019s actions respond to shifts in international public support. The main finding is that shifts in public support reduce conflict intensity, particularly for Israel. This effect is greater than the effect of the key international actors\u2014United States, Egypt, and United Nations. The results provide an important insight into how information technology is changing the role of international audiences in conflict.",

This study\u2019s main contribution is to demonstrate the combined utility of mediation and UN peacekeeping. Mediation builds trust and confidence and works with the parties to design an efficacious agreement conducive to, among other features, tamping down post-agreement violence. Peacekeeping stems violence and facilitates the implementation of the agreement. Agreements that are mediated and followed by UN peacekeeping are expected to be more robust in terms of staving off violence. We report the effects of the mediation\u2013peacekeeping interaction using a method correcting for a common misinterpretation of interaction terms. We test logit and hazard models using a sample of full and partial civil war peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011. Controlling for agreement design, democracy, and income per capita, the results indicate mediation and its interaction with peacekeeping reduce the probability of renewed/continuing violence and have a positive impact on agreement duration. We also report brief case study evidence from the 1990s peace process in Guatemala.",

            "abstract": "What increases warring parties\u2019 ability to reach a negotiated settlement? In this study, I answer this question by examining the political environment a government and rebel group leadership internally encounter during a peace process. I disaggregate in-group dynamics of governments and rebels into their respective political elements that either grant autonomy or create constraints for resolution, namely, their constituencies and elites. I argue that willingness to end fighting does not always translate into the ability to make concessions. Although battlefield-related indicators may increase the likelihood of negotiations, it is internal cohesion that increases combatants\u2019 credibility as bargaining partners and improves the likelihood of settlement. To test these arguments, I introduce original data on negotiations for internal conflict-dyad-years between 1980 and 2005. Findings using two-stage censored probit models demonstrate that war-weariness increases willingness for negotiations whereas internal consensus creates opportunity for settlement.",

It engages directly the idea that peace emerges only as a process comprised of battle, negotiation, agreement, and implementation of an agreement. I hypothesize that events at earlier stages of the peace process have implications for later stages, but not always in the same ways. Drawing on bargaining models of war, I consider how two factors that might prevent successful bargaining\u2014stalemates and the number of actors\u2014can encourage cooperation early in a peace process but impede lasting cooperation at later stages. Using a nested dichotomies statistical approach to capture interdependence, I find support for the argument that stalemates and the number of actors have different effects depending on the stage of the peace process. The results substantiate the need in theoretical and policy work to consider peace as an interdependent, sequential process.",

The PNCC goes beyond recording instances of peace talks by offering a conceptual framework to identify when a government-rebel group dyad is at risk of formal negotiations. It explicitly considers issues central in event-history modelling, including censoring and the observation period. The PNCC also provides detailed information on negotiations, including the date and location of peace talks, and whether negotiations were bilateral or through mediation. The PNCC is the first source to distinguish mediated and non-mediated civil conflict negotiations under a single framework. Structured over the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset with global coverage for 1975-2013, the PNCC is integrable to commonly used civil war datasets.",

How are patterns of social identification shaped by conflict? We draw on empirical results regarding the nature and determinants of group identification to develop a simple model that addresses these questions. The model highlights the possibility of vicious and virtuous cycles where conflict and identification patterns reinforce each other. It also shows how processes of ethnic identification amplify the importance of political institutions and traces the effects of national status and perceived differences across ethnic groups. Finally, we demonstrate how a small but sufficiently potent group of ethnic radicals can derail a peaceful equilibrium, leading to the polarization of the entire population. We reexamine several historical cases as well as empirical correlates of civil wars in light of these results.",

This article proposes a normative conflict model, which distinguishes between nonconformity due to dissent (challenging norms to change them) and nonconformity due to disengagement (distancing oneself from the group). The normative conflict model predicts that strongly identified members are likely to challenge group norms when they experience conflict between norms and important alternate standards for behavior, in particular when they perceive norms as being harmful to the group. Data in support of the model are reviewed, mechanisms by which external variables may influence dissent in social groups are elaborated, and the model is linked to contemporary perspectives on collective identity.",

This article discusses one determinant of negative attitudes toward immigrants and immigration: perceived competition for resources. We present our instrumental model of group conflict, which suggests that competition for resources, and attempts to remove this competition, are important determinants of intergroup attitudes and behavior. We then review relevant research on perceived competition and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research for attempts to alleviate tension between immigrants and members of host populations, and for our more general model of group conflict.",

I develop a diffusion model of rebel fragmentation in which participation in rebellion spreads, completely or incompletely, through networks of civilians and dissidents. Using this theoretical framework I hypothesize that two factors jointly determine whether a rebel movement remains unified or fragments: the rebels\u2019 investment in civilian mobilization, and the overall level of civilian grievances. The theory predicts that widely shared grievances motivate the formation of many small dissident groups willing to challenge the regime. Given the difficulty of collective action between disparate opposition actors, an emerging rebel movement will tend towards fragmentation when popular grievances are high. Yet extremely high civilian grievances can also help rebels activate broad, overlapping civilian social networks that serve to bridge together dissident groups. Mass-mobilizing rebel groups, benefiting from the participation of broad civilian networks, are most likely to forge and maintain a unified rebel front. I test this theory alongside several alternatives drawn from cross-national studies of conflict using regression analysis. The quantitative evidence lends considerable credence to the role of rebel constituencies in preventing or fomenting rebel fragmentation.",

Because machine-based and human-centric approaches to content analysis have different strengths for extracting information from unstructured text, the authors argue for a collaborative, hybrid approach that combines their comparative advantages. The notion of a progressive supervised-learning approach that combines data science techniques and human coders is developed and illustrated using the Social, Political and Economic Event Database (SPEED) project\u2019s Societal Stability Protocol. SPEED\u2019s rich event data on civil strife reveal that conventional machine-based approaches for generating event data miss a great deal of within-category variance, while conventional human-based efforts to categorize periods of civil war or political instability routinely misspecify periods of calm and unrest. To demonstrate the potential of hybrid data collection methods, SPEED data on event intensities and origins are used to trace the changing role of political, socioeconomic, and sociocultural factors in generating global civil strife in the post\u2013World War II era.",

            "abstract": "This article identifies and addresses key conceptual and measurement issues raised by measures of state capacity in studies of civil conflict. First, it reviews competing definitions and operationalizations of state capacity, focusing specifically on those that emphasize (1) military capacity, (2) bureaucratic administrative capacity, and (3) the quality and coherence of political institutions. Second, it critically assesses these measures on the basis of construct validity, focusing attention on whether they accurately capture the theoretical concept of state capacity, and whether they allow the researcher to differentiate between competing causal mechanisms. Third, it employs principal factor analysis to identify the underlying dimensionality of 15 different operationalizations of state capacity. State capacity is characterized by low dimensionality, with three factors \u2014 or dimensions of state capacity \u2014 explaining over 90% of the variance in the 15 measures. While the first factor, rational legality, captures bureaucratic and administrative capacity, the second, rentier-autocraticness, and third, neopatrimoniality, capture aspects of state capacity that cut across theoretical categories. The article concludes by suggesting a multivariate approach to modeling state capacity, and that (1) survey measures of bureaucratic quality, and (2) tax capacity are the most theoretically and empirically justified.",

            "title": "Resource Curse or Rentier Peace? The Ambiguous Effects of Oil Wealth and Oil Dependence on Violent Conflict",
            "abstract": "The \u2018resource curse\u2019 hypothesis claims that abundance in natural resources, particularly oil, encourages especially civil war. Natural resources provide both motive and opportunity for conflict and create indirect institutional and economic causes of instability. Contrarily, the theory of the rentier state \u2014 largely neglected in the study of peace and war in this respect \u2014 suggests that regimes use revenue from abundant resources to buy off peace through patronage, large-scale distributive policies and effective repression. Consequently, such rentier states would tend to be more stable politically and less prone to conflict. These two theories thus imply ambivalent effects of resource abundance on conflict proneness. This article presents part of a solution to this apparent puzzle for the case of oil-producing countries. The key argument is that both resource wealth per capita and resource dependence need to be taken into account, since only the availability of very high per capita revenues from oil allows governments to achieve internal stability. The empirical analysis supports this hypothesis. The findings of multivariate cross-country regressions indicate a U-shaped relationship between oil dependence and civil war onset, while high resource wealth per capita tends to be associated with less violence. The results of a macro-qualitative comparison for a reduced sample of highly dependent oil exporters are even more clearcut. Using the same reduced sample, we find that oil-wealthy countries apparently manage to maintain political stability by a combination of large-scale distribution, high spending on the security apparatus and protection by outsiders. Compared to oil-poor countries and in contradiction to the rentier state theory, the institutions of oil-wealthy countries do not seem to be particularly characterized by patronage and clientelism.",

            "abstract": "Why do armed groups recruit large numbers of children as fighters, often coercively? The international community has tried to curb these crimes by shaming and punishing leaders who commit them\u2014in short, making the crimes costlier. Are these policies effective and sufficient? The answer lies in more attention to the strategic interaction between rebel leaders and recruits. We adapt theories of industrial organization to rebellious groups and show how, being less able fighters, children are attractive recruits if and only if they are easier to intimidate, indoctrinate and misinform than adults. This ease of manipulation interacts with the costliness of war crimes to influence rebel leaders' incentives to coerce children into war. We use a case study and a novel survey of former child recruits in Uganda to illustrate this argument and provide hard evidence not only that children are more easily manipulated in war, but also how something often asserted but never demonstrated. Our theory, as well as a new \" cross-rebel \" dataset, also support the idea that costliness matters: foreign governments, international organizations, diasporas, and local populations can discourage child recruitment by withholding resources or punishing offenders (or, conversely, encourage these crimes by failing to act). But punishing war crimes has limitations, and can only take us so far. Children's reintegration opportunities must be at least as great as adults' (something that demobilization programs sometimes fail to do). Also, indoctrination and misinformation can be directly influenced. We observe grassroots innovations in Uganda that could be models for the prevention and curbing of child soldiering and counter-insurgency generally. the anonymous referees, and numerous seminar participants for comments.

This is troubling, as contiguous third parties account for a large proportion of interventions. I demonstrate that the tendency of civil wars to spread geographically pose neighbor states with threats to their well-being that are faced by no other type of intervener in the international system. Destruction, regime stability, even state survival are threatened by the prospect of civil war infection. I argue that neighboring third parties are thus motivated to intervene in an attempt to thwart war diffusion across their own borders. Through an analysis of civil war prevalence, I generate a measure of each state's yearly likelihood of being infected by a proximate civil war's hostilities. I then use this measure to explain neighboring interventions in civil wars of the post-WWII period. The results support my theorized expectations.",

We construct and analyze a new dataset of geo-referenced politically relevant ethnic groups, covering the entire world during the period from 1951 through 2005. Our results show that the conflict probability of marginalized groups increases with the demographic power balance compared to the group(s) in power. Furthermore, the risk of conflict increases with the distance from the group to the capital, and the roughness of the terrain in the group's settlement area. We also find that while the results for demographic group strength hold for all ethnic civil wars, the geographic factors apply for territorial ethnic conflicts only.",

We construct an original measure of agriculture-relevant weather shocks exploiting within-year variation in weather and in crop growing season and spatial variation in crop cover. Temporal and spatial spillovers in conflict are addressed through spatial econometric techniques. Negative shocks occurring during the growing season of local crops affect conflict incidence persistently, and local conflict spills over to neighboring cells. We use our estimates to trace the dynamic response to shocks and predict how future warming may affect violence.",

            "abstract": "Collier and Hoeffler reported that countries with a higher percentage of national income from primary commodity exports have been more prone to civil war, an interesting finding that has received much attention from policy makers and the media. The author shows that this result is quite fragile, even using Collier and Hoeffler\u2019s data. Minor changes in the sample framing and the recovery of missing data undermine it. To the extent that there is an association, it is likely because oil is a major component of primary commodity exports and substantial oil production does associate with civil war risk. The author argues that oil predicts civil war risk not because it provides an easy source of rebel start-up finance but probably because oil producers have relatively low state capabilities given their level of per capita income and because oil makes state or regional control a tempting \u201cprize.\u201d An analysis of data on government observance of contracts and investor-perceived expropriation risk is consistent with this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "How do civilians decide when to leave their homes during conflict? Existing research emphasizes the role of violence in driving civilian migration decisions. Yet, migration timing often does not correspond with the timing of violence. To explain this discrepancy, I argue that violence fits within broader considerations of motivation and opportunity to migrate. Witnessing violence triggers post-traumatic growth that delays narrative ruptures and the subsequent migration that they motivate. Civilians who have \u2018wasta\u2019 \u2013 an advantaged social position resulting from some combination of money and connections \u2013 have the opportunity to migrate safely. Civilians who possess both motivation and opportunity migrate earlier. I use over 170 structured interviews with Syrian refugees in Turkey to test this argument. Descriptively, respondents who did not witness violence (early motivation) left their homes seven months earlier, on average. Respondents with wasta (opportunity) left their homes one full year earlier, on average. Respondents who both did not witness violence (early motivation) and had wasta left their homes approximately one and a half years earlier, on average. Cox proportional hazard models reveal that respondents only migrated earlier in the conflict if they had both early motivation and opportunity. Open-ended responses from the interviews support the quantitative results and help explain their causal mechanisms. These findings contribute to understandings of conflict-induced migration, civil war, and the Syrian conflict.",

            "title": "Ethiopia's Involvement in the Sudanese Civil War: Was It as Significant as Khartoum Claimed?",
            "abstract": "Conflicts in Africa have arisen from a long list of antagonisms. Stephen John Stedman's list of problems generating conflict is very relevant to understanding the prolonged and complex Sudanese conflict. This list includes \"the tugs and pulls of different identities, the differential distri- bution of resources and access to power, and competing definitions of what is right, fair and just.\" Stedman states that when individuals and groups turn to violence to solve such problems, conflict takes on a second dimension, that of security and survival, and this, in turn, makes conflict resolution as multifaceted as the conflict itself. In such a scenario, the conflict might become prolonged because the antagonists come to fear the consequences of settlement, in which parties choose mutual security arrangements over the individual pursuit of security. 1 Moreover, the fre- quent spilling of an internal conflict across borders inherited from the colonialist period, and thus the consequent interweaving of the internal dispute into regional and sometimes even international political intrigues, reinforces the complexity of the conflict. The longer the con- flict continues, the greater the military and political dependence of the warring parties on their respective foreign supporters. In the search for a model of a conflict that includes all the above-men- tioned sources of antagonism and even contributes substantial elements of its own, Sudan's civil war and Ethiopia's involvement in it provide an ideal example. Although Ethiopia was not the only country in the region to intervene in the Sudanese war, it was the most consistently involved,",

            "abstract": "Previous research has interpreted the correlation between per capita income and civil war as evidence that poverty is a main determinant of conflict. In this paper, we find that the relationship between poverty and civil war is spurious and is accounted for by historical phenomena that jointly determine income evolution and conflict. In particular, the statistical association between poverty and civil wars disappears once we include country fixed effects. Also, using crosssection data for 1960 to 2000, we find that once historical variables like European settler mortality rates and the population density in 1500 are included in civil war regressions, poverty does not have an effect on civil wars. These results are confirmed using longer time series from 1825 to 2000.",

            "abstract": "We examine how Syria\u2019s local growing seasons and precipitation variability affected patterns of violence during the country\u2019s civil war (2011\u201319). Among Syria\u2019s 272 subdistricts (nahiyah), we study conflict events initiated by the Assad regime or its allies, and, separately, by other armed non-government groups (\u2018rebels\u2019). Throughout the war, violence to capture agriculture has been used regularly to control valuable cropland and harvests. Combatants also seek to deny their adversaries access to these resources by deploying violence to destroy agriculture. We test the hypothesis that conflict was most likely during local growing seasons due to both of these motivations. Additionally, we examine whether unusually dry conditions further elevated the risk of conflict during growing season months. A theory for why higher levels of conflict would occur during unusually dry conditions is that livelihood losses elevate incentives to control scarce crops and also facilitate recruitment of militants or their sympathizers. We find that violent events initiated by the government and rebel groups are both more likely during the growing season than other times of the year. There is also evidence that dry conditions during the growing season led to an increase in government-initiated attacks over the duration of the war. We find the strongest relationship between precipitation deficits and both government- and rebel-initiated violence in later years of the war. Compared with our growing season results, the rainfall deviation estimates are less consistent across models.",

            "title": "Climate change and the opportunity cost of conflict",
            "abstract": "Significance There is growing consensus among academics that climate change may amplify the risk of violent conflicts. While underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, negative income shocks associated with climate variability have been long hypothesized to play an important role. We relate recent hydrologic and microeconomic advances to investigate the theoretical foundation of this claim. Results prescribe caution in interpreting empirical relations between climate variability and conflict in the context of climate change. While fighting preferentially occurs during climate anomalies, more frequent anomalies may not yield more conflicts. By shifting the entire distribution of rainfall, climate change effectively redefines the very notion of climate anomaly. Adaptation to this new normal can have a dominant, and often counterintuitive, effect on conflict probability. A growing empirical literature associates climate anomalies with increased risk of violent conflict. This association has been portrayed as a bellwether of future societal instability as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are predicted to increase. This paper investigates the theoretical foundation of this claim. A seminal microeconomic model of opportunity costs\u2014a mechanism often thought to drive climate\u2013conflict relationships\u2014is extended by considering realistic changes in the distribution of climate-dependent agricultural income. Results advise caution in using empirical associations between short-run climate anomalies and conflicts to predict the effect of sustained shifts in climate regimes: Although war occurs in bad years, conflict may decrease if agents expect more frequent bad years. Theory suggests a nonmonotonic relation between climate variability and conflict that emerges as agents adapt and adjust their behavior to the new income distribution. We identify 3 measurable statistics of the income distribution that are each unambiguously associated with conflict likelihood. Jointly, these statistics offer a unique signature to distinguish opportunity costs from competing mechanisms that may relate climate anomalies to conflict.",

            "abstract": "It has often been predicted that large numbers of people will be displaced by climate change and that this will lead to violent conflict. At the core of this prediction is a simple causal model which assumes that climate change will result in resource scarcities, which in turn will drive migration as well as violent conflict. Academic research into the links between climate change, migration and conflict has questioned such predictions; their theoretical foundation and empirical support are thin. This does not mean that climate change will be irrelevant for future patterns of migration, including migration that may be linked to violent conflict. However, it has become clear that the links between climate change, migration and conflict are complex and defy simple and sensationalist conclusions. After outlining the state of the art on climate migration and the environment\u2013migration\u2013conflict nexus, this article sketches the environmental, economic and sociopolitical consequences of climate change contributing to migration and the different functions of migration in this context, for instance as an adaptive strategy to environmental change. It then delineates the different theorized pathways from migration to conflict escalation, evaluates their analytical value and develops a more differentiated model of the assumed links between climate change, migration and conflict.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between climate change and conflict appears to be widely accepted amongst political leaders and the general public. Yet, conflict scholars have failed to find consistent support for the hypothesized linkage. This paper identifies potential reasons for this disconnect and makes suggestions about analysis of climate change-conflict connections could be altered to overcome them. It observes that current research has not only reproduced some of the flaws of the environmental conflict (EC) literature from the 1990s, but exacerbated them by moving further backward on the causal chain, from the already expansive category of environmental degradation to the even broader issue of climate change. Yet, there has been some progress in producing a closer match between theory and models. To build on these developments, the paper advocates shortening the causal chain by channeling the impacts of climate change on conflict through the intermediate factor of agriculture. It also proposes a shift in analysis, from the effects of climate change to the influence of climate uncertainty. Whereas assessments of the former have simply reiterated the causal processes examined in the EC literature, the latter could introduce a new, alternative set of mechanisms, thereby differentiating climate variation from environmental degradation and strengthening the rationale for a continuing research program.",

            "abstract": "Dominant climate models suggest that large parts of Africa will experience greater climatic variability and increasing rates of drought in coming decades. This could have severe societal consequences, because the economies and food supplies of most African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture. According to leading environmental security scholars, policymakers, and nongovernmental organizations, an increase in scarcity-driven armed conflicts should also be expected. A conditional theory of environmental conflict predicts that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. However, an empirical evaluation of this general proposition through a unique gridded dataset of postcolonial Africa, which combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethnopolitical context, shows little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.",

            "title": "African range wars: Climate, conflict, and property rights",
            "abstract": "This article examines the effect of climate change on a type of armed conflict that pits pastoralists (cattle herders) against each other (range wars). Such conflicts are typically fought over water rights and/or grazing rights to unfenced/unowned land. The state is rarely involved directly. The rangeland of East Africa is a region particularly vulnerable to drought and livestock diseases associated with climate change. To analyze the possible effects of climate change on pastoral conflict, we focus our analysis on changes in resource availability, contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The role of resources is further contextualized by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. We employ a contest success function (CSF) game-theoretic model to analyze the logic of range wars. This CSF approach emphasizes the low-level, non-binary nature of raiding behavior between pastoralist groups over limited natural resources. A central contribution of this approach is that the logic of raiding behavior implies a positive relationship between resources and conflict. This positive relationship is supported by several studies of the rangeland of East Africa, but is generally dismissed by the literature on the \u2018resource curse\u2019. This relationship is contingent on other factors examined in the model, producing the following results. First, the level of property rights protection provided by the state generally reduces conflict between pastoralist groups. Second, if property rights protection is provided in a biased manner, then conflict between pastoralist groups increases. Third, severe resource asymmetries between two pastoralist groups will induce the poorer group to become bandits (focusing their efforts on raiding and not producing), while the richer group raids in retaliation.",

            "abstract": "Penelitian ini menganalisis konflik di sekitar pertambangan dan merumuskan resolusi konflik sebagai strategi pemberdayaan masyarakat di Kabupaten Bombana, Sulawesi Tenggara. Penelitian ini dirancang dengan metode survei deskriptif. Populasi penelitian adalah rumah tangga yang tinggal di desa-desa sekitar wilayah pertambangan, baik di darat maupun di pulau-pulau. Teknik proportional cluster sampling digunakan untuk menentukan sampel. Analisis statistik dilakukan dengan menggunakan statistik deskriptif dan statistik inferensial. Uji statistik inferensial yang digunakan adalah analisis regresi berganda dan uji t untuk menganalisis perbedaan antara responden di daratan dan pulau-pulau. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa konflik antara perusahaan dengan masyarakat sekitar pertambangan di Kabupaten Bombana tergolong tinggi. Konflik tersebut meliputi proses pendudukan Sumber Daya Alam (SDA), dominasi perusahaan atas sumber daya alam, dan penanganan dampak negatif. Strategi pemberdayaan masyarakat sekitar pertambangan melalui pengelolaan konflik adalah: (1) Mempercepat penyelesaian konflik yang ada dengan pola musyawarah dan melibatkan semua pihak, termasuk masyarakat setempat, pemerintah, dan penegak hukum setempat. (2) Mendorong perusahaan pertambangan untuk meningkatkan pengelolaan lingkungan yang terkena dampak untuk mencegah kerusakan lingkungan. (3) Meningkatkan pola kerjasama antara perusahaan, pemerintah, dan masyarakat dalam pengelolaan sumber daya alam. (4) Mencegah konflik sosial. Upaya peningkatan pemberdayaan masyarakat sekitar pertambangan dapat dilakukan melalui kerjasama antara pemerintah, perusahaan, dan masyarakat. Pemerintah dan perusahaan memiliki sumber daya yang cukup untuk menginisiasi program pemberdayaan masyarakat sekitar pertambangan di Kabupaten Bombana.\u00a0ABSTRACTThis study analyzes conflicts around mining and formulates conflict resolution as a strategy for community empowerment in Bombana Regency, Southeast Sulawesi. The study was designed with a descriptive survey method. The research population is the householder living in villages around the mining area, both on land and in the islands. The proportional cluster sampling technique does the determination of the sample. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The inferential statistical test used is multiple regression analysis and t-test to analyze the differences between respondents on the mainland and the islands. The study results indicate that conflicts between companies and communities around mining in Bombana Regency are high. These conflicts include the process of occupation of Natural Resources (SDA), the domination of companies over natural resources, and the handling of negative impacts. Strategies for empowering communities around mining through conflict management are: (1) Accelerating the resolution of existing conflicts with a deliberation pattern and involving all parties, including the local community, government, and local law enforcement. (2) Encouraging mining companies to improve management of the affected environment to prevent environmental damage. (3) Improving the pattern of cooperation between companies, the government, and the community in the management of natural resources. (4) Preventing social conflicts. Efforts to increase the empowerment of communities around mining can be carried out through collaboration between the government, companies, and the community. The government and companies have sufficient resources to initiate community empowerment programs around mining in Bombana Regency.",

            "abstract": "Life on the frontlines of a civil war is markedly different from life in safe(r) areas. How does this drastic difference in lived experience shape civilian attitudes toward war and peace? Contrary to theories that link conflict exposure to intransigence, I argue that under certain conditions, exposure increases support for both peace as an outcome and the granting of concessions to armed actors who render settlement more likely. I use various model specifications and matching methodology on survey data from the Colombian peace process, finding strong evidence that civilians in conflict zones exhibit greater support for the peace process overall and are more willing to grant political concessions to armed groups. Mixed evidence further suggests that exposed civilians are less willing to reintegrate with demobilized fighters. The study has theoretical implications for accounts of conflict exposure and helps explain regional variation in the failed referendum vote in Colombia.",

We begin with the observation that violence increased levels of collective action like voting and community organization\ufffda finding consistent with other recent studies of postconflict societies. We use lab-in-the-field techniques to tease apart such effects. Our causal-identification strategy exploits communities' exogenous isolation from the unpredictable path of insurgency combined with matching. We find that violence-affected communities exhibit higher levels of prosocial motivation, measured by altruistic giving, public good contributions, investment in trust-based transactions, and willingness to reciprocate trust-based investments. We find evidence to support two social transformation mechanisms: (1) a purging mechanism by which less social persons disproportionately flee communities plagued by war and (2) a collective coping mechanism by which individuals who have few options to flee band together to cope with threats.",

            "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in reconciliation in societies emerging from conflict. The North Caucasus region of Russia has experienced multiple and diverse conflicts since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and violence continues, although at a lower level than a decade ago. We examine willingness to forgive members of other ethnic groups for violence that they have perpetuated as an indicator of the potential for reconciliation in the region. Using data from a large representative survey conducted in five ethnic republics of the North Caucasus in December 2005, we analyze responses to the forgiveness question in relation to social\u2013psychological models of reconciliation, and we add a key geographic measure, distance to violent events, to the usual theories. Using the survey data (N = 2,000) and aggregate data for the eighty-two sampling points, we use a multilevel modeling approach to separate out the effects of individual and contextual factors. We find little support for the social identity theory expectations as ethnic hostility is not an important factor, except for in the case of the Ossetians, a mostly Orthodox minority disproportionately affected by multiple conflicts and the Beslan school killings. Instead, personal experiences of violence and terrorism, the impacts of military actions against communities, differences in general trust of others, and the extent to which the respondent's life has been changed by violence negatively influence the willingness to forgive. Conversely, respondents in ethnic Russian communities and those relatively close to violence are more willing to engage in postconflict reconciliation.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of urbanization, the boom of vehicle numbers has resulted in serious traffic accidents, which led to casualties and huge economic losses. The ability to predict the risk of traffic accident is important in the prevention of the occurrence of accidents and to reduce the damages caused by accidents in a proactive way. However, traffic accident risk prediction with high spatiotemporal resolution is difficult, mainly due to the complex traffic environment, human behavior, and lack of real-time traffic-related data. Based on the quantitative analysis of big traffic accident data, this paper first introduced an important characteristic of traffic accidents - the spatiotemporal correlation, and then constructed a high accurate deep learning model for traffic accident risk prediction based on spatiotemporal correlation pattern. The predictive accident risk can be potential applied to the traffic accident warning system. The proposed method can be integrated into an intelligent traffic control system toward a more reasonable traffic prediction and command organization.",

            "abstract": "Machine-learning algorithms are transforming large segments of the economy as they fuel innovation in search engines, self-driving cars, product marketing, and medical imaging, among many other technologies. As machine learning\u2019s use expands across all facets of society, anxiety has emerged about the intrusion of algorithmic machines into facets of life previously dependent on human judgment. Alarm bells sounding over the diffusion of artificial intelligence throughout the private sector only portend greater anxiety about digital robots replacing humans in the governmental sphere. A few administrative agencies have already begun to adopt this technology, while others have clear potential in the near term to use algorithms to shape official decisions over both rulemaking and adjudication. It is no longer fanciful to envision a future in which government agencies could effectively make law by robot, a prospect that understandably conjures up dystopian images of individuals surrendering their liberty to the control of computerized overlords. Should society be alarmed by governmental use of machine-learning applications? We examine this question by considering whether the use of robotic decision tools by government agencies can pass muster under core, time-honored doctrines of administrative and constitutional law. At first glance, the idea of algorithmic regulation might appear to offend one or more traditional doctrines, such as the nondelegation doctrine, procedural due process, equal protection, or principles of reason-giving and transparency. We conclude, however, that when machine-learning technology is properly understood, its use by government agencies can comfortably fit within these conventional legal parameters. We recognize, of course, that the legality of regulation by robot is only one criterion by which its use should be assessed. Agencies should not apply algorithms cavalierly, even if doing so might not run afoul of the law; in some cases, safeguards may be needed for machine learning to satisfy broader, good-governance aspirations. Yet, in contrast with the emerging alarmism, we resist any categorical dismissal of a future administrative state in which algorithmic automation guides, and even at times makes, key decisions. Instead, we urge that governmental reliance on machine learning should be approached with measured optimism about the potential benefits such technology can offer society by making government smarter and its decisions more efficient and just.",

Most existing approaches (e.g., LASSO regression, dynamic query expansion, and burst detection) address some, but not all, of these challenges. Here, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that aims to concurrently address all the challenges involved. Specifically, given a collection of locations (e.g., cities), forecasting models are built for all the locations simultaneously by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information that effectively increases the sample size for each location, thus improving the forecasting performance. The new model combines both static features derived from a predefined vocabulary by domain experts and dynamic features generated from dynamic query expansion in a multi-task feature learning framework. Different strategies to balance homogeneity and diversity between static and dynamic terms are also investigated. And, efficient algorithms based on Iterative Group Hard Thresholding are developed to achieve efficient and effective model training and prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations on Twitter data from civil unrest and influenza outbreak datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "The forecasting of significant societal events such as civil unrest and economic crisis is an interesting and challenging problem which requires both timeliness, precision, and comprehensiveness. Significant societal events are influenced and indicated jointly by multiple aspects of a society, including its economics, politics, and culture. Traditional forecasting methods based on a single data source find it hard to cover all these aspects comprehensively, thus limiting model performance. Multi-source event forecasting has proven promising but still suffers from several challenges, including (1) geographical hierarchies in multi-source data features, (2) hierarchical missing values, (3) characterization of structured feature sparsity, and (4) difficulty in model\u2019s online update with incomplete multiple sources. This article proposes a novel feature learning model that concurrently addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, given multi-source data from different geographical levels, we design a new forecasting model by characterizing the lower-level features\u2019 dependence on higher-level features. To handle the correlations amidst structured feature sets and deal with missing values among the coupled features, we propose a novel feature learning model based on an Nth-order strong hierarchy and fused-overlapping group Lasso. An efficient algorithm is developed to optimize model parameters and ensure global optima. More importantly, to enable the model update in real time, the online learning algorithm is formulated and active set techniques are leveraged to resolve the crucial challenge when new patterns of missing features appear in real time. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets in different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models.",

            "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future events brings great benefits and reduces losses for society in many domains, such as civil unrest, pandemics, and crimes. Knowledge graph is a general language for describing and modeling complex systems. Different types of events continually occur, which are often related to historical and concurrent events. In this paper, we formalize the future event prediction as a temporal knowledge graph reasoning problem. Most existing studies either conduct reasoning on static knowledge graphs or assume knowledges graphs of all timestamps are available during the training process. As a result, they cannot effectively reason over temporal knowledge graphs and predict events happening in the future. To address this problem, some recent works learn to infer future events based on historical event-based temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods do not comprehensively consider the latent patterns and influences behind historical events and concurrent events simultaneously. This paper proposes a new graph representation learning model, namely Recurrent Event Graph ATtention Network (RE-GAT), based on a novel historical and concurrent events attention-aware mechanism by modeling the event knowledge graph sequence recurrently. More specifically, our RE-GAT uses an attention-based historical events embedding module to encode past events, and employs an attentionbased concurrent events embedding module to model the associations of events at the same timestamp. A translation-based decoder module and a learning objective are developed to optimize the embeddings of entities and relations. We evaluate our proposed method on four benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our RE-GAT model comparing to various baselines, which proves that our method can more accurately predict what events are going to happen.",

            "abstract": "The forecasting of significant societal events such as civil unrest and economic crisis is an interesting and challenging problem which requires both timeliness, precision, and comprehensiveness. Significant societal events are influenced and indicated jointly by multiple aspects of a society, including its economics, politics, and culture. Traditional forecasting methods based on a single data source find it hard to cover all these aspects comprehensively, thus limiting model performance. Multi-source event forecasting has proven promising but still suffers from several challenges, including 1) geographical hierarchies in multi-source data features, 2) hierarchical missing values, 3) characterization of structured feature sparsity, and 4) difficulty in model\u2019s online update with incomplete multiple sources. This paper proposes a novel feature learning model that concurrently addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, given multi-source data from different geographical levels, we design a new forecasting model by characterizing the lower-level features\u2019 dependence on higher-level features. To handle the correlations amidst structured feature sets and deal with missing values among the coupled features, we propose a novel feature learning model based on an N th-order strong hierarchy and fused-overlapping group Lasso. An efficient algorithm is developed to optimize model parameters and ensure global optima. More importantly, to enable the model update in real time, the online learning algorithm is formulated and active set techniques are leveraged to resolve the crucial challenge when new patterns of missing features appear in real time. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets in different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We present a two-stage approach to civil conflict analysis. Unlike conventional approaches that focus only on armed conflict and treat all other cases as \u201cat peace,\u201d we first distinguish cases with and without contested incompatibilities (Stage 1) and then whether or not contested incompatibilities escalate to armed conflict (Stage 2). This allows us to analyze factors that relate to conflict origination (onset of incompatibilities) and factors that predict conflict militarization (onset of armed violence). Using new data on incompatibilities and armed conflict, we replicate and extend three prior studies of violent civil conflict, reformulated as a two-stage process, considering different estimation procedures and potential selection problems. We find that the group-based horizontal political inequalities highlighted in research on violent civil conflict clearly relate to conflict origination but have no clear association with militarization, whereas other features emphasized as shaping the risk of civil war, such as refugee flows and soft state power, predict militarization but not incompatibilities. A two-stage approach to conflict analysis can help advance theories of civil conflict, assess alternative mechanisms through which explanatory variables are thought to influence conflict, and guide new data-collection efforts.",

            "abstract": "Why are some African countries trapped in vicious cycles of ethnic exclusion and civil war, while others experience relative peace? In this groundbreaking book, Philip Roessler addresses this question. Roessler models Africa's weak, ethnically-divided states as confronting rulers with a coup-civil war trap - sharing power with ethnic rivals is necessary to underwrite societal peace and prevent civil war, but increases rivals' capabilities to seize sovereign power in a coup d'etat. How rulers respond to this strategic trade-off is shown to be a function of their country's ethnic geography and the distribution of threat capabilities it produces. Moving between in-depth case studies of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on years of field work and statistical analyses of powersharing, coups and civil war across sub-Saharan Africa, the book serves as an exemplar of the benefits of mixed methods research for theory-building and testing in comparative politics.",

            "abstract": "Postulating grievance-based mechanisms, several recent studies show that politically excluded ethnic groups are more likely to experience civil conflict. However, critics argue that endogeneity may undermine this finding since governments' decisions to include or exclude could be motivated by the anticipation of conflict. We counter this threat to inference by articulating a causal pathway that explains ethnic groups' access to power independently of conflict. Focusing on postcolonial states, we exploit differences in colonial empires' strategies of rule to model which ethnic groups were represented in government at the time of independence. This identification strategy allows estimating the exogenous effect of inclusiveness on conflict. We find that previous studies have tended to understate the conflict-dampening impact of political inclusion. This finding suggests that grievances have been prematurely dismissed from conventional explanations of conflict, and that policy makers should consider conflict resolution methods based on power sharing and group rights.

            "abstract": "To explain the distribution of civil wars, guerrilla warfare, and revolutionary outbreaks, the literature on modern political violence has shifted, broadly speaking, from a modernization perspective that emphasized the role of material conflict and of grievances to a more recent research program that stresses the geographical and organizational opportunities that insurgents may have to engage in violence. Drawing on those lines of inquiry equally, this article offers an integrated analytical model that considers both the motives and the opportunities of states and rebels. Civil wars, guerrillas, and revolutionary outbreaks are seen as a result of the nature and distribution of wealth in each country. Systematic and organized violent conflicts are most likely in economies where inequality is high and wealth is mostly immobile, that is, in societies where those worse off would benefit substantially from expropriating all assets. Violence is conditional on the mobilizational and organizational capacity of challengers and on the state capacity to control its territory. The theory is tested on data on civil wars from 1850 to 1999 for the whole world and on data on guerrilla warfare and revolutionary episodes spanning the years from 1919 to 1997 across all countries.",

In this article, the author examines the relationship between ethnic identity and civil war and points to several empirical instances of fluidity in the behavioral expression of ethnic identities within civil war. The author identifies two processes that are consistent with constructivist theorizing: identity shift and ethnic defection. The author provides several empirical illustrations along with a micro-level test of the determinants of ethnic defection. At the micro level, ethnic defection is best predicted by the extent of territorial control exercised by the incumbent political actor and the level of prior insurgent violence. The author also hypothesizes that at the macro level, ethnic defection is a function of the resources available to incumbent actors and conclude by stressing the need to take seriously the endogenous dynamics of civil wars.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. This article aims to integrate different explanatory approaches to ethnic conflicts: studies on ethnic clientelism and discrimination, on political mobilisation by minority elites, on unequal relations between ethnoregions, and on the effects that different political systems have on the dynamics of ethnic conflicts. For each of these approaches, the relevant research is reviewed and illustrated by selected examples from post-imperial societies. Propositions that seem empirically plausible are integrated into a comparative model which is in turn based on a specific theory of political modernity. The premise holds that the politicisation of ethnicity is to be interpreted as a central aspect of modem state-building. For only when \u2018people\u2019 and state are mutually related within the ideal of a legitimate order does the question arise for which ethnic group the state has to act, who is regarded as its legitimate owner, and who is entitled to have access to its services. Ethnic conflicts can thus be interpreted as struggles for the collective goods of the nation-state. Within this paradigmatical frame, a step-by-step analysis at a medium level of abstraction tries to show under which conditions state-building leads to an ethnicisation of political conflicts and in some cases to an escalation into rebellions and wars.",

            "abstract": "We study inter-group conflict driven by economic changes within groups. We show that if group incomes are \u201clow\u201d, increasing group incomes raises violence against that group, and lowers violence generated by it. These correlations are tests for group aggression or victimization, which we apply to Hindu-Muslim violence in India. Our main result is that an increase in per-capita Muslim expenditures generates a large and significant increase in future religious conflict, an increase in Hindu well-being has no significant effect. This robust empirical finding, combined with the theory, suggests that Hindu groups have been primarily responsible for Hindu-Muslim violence in post-Independence India.

            "abstract": "We offer a simple general equilibrium model to analyze how economy-wide forces (i.e. shocks to terms of trade, technology and endowments) will affect the intensity of social conflict over the distribution of resources. Examples of conflict activities range from crime to civil war. We show that not all favorable shocks to an economy will reduce conflict, even when they could make society richer. Rather, positive shocks to labor intensive industries will raise wages and diminish social conflict, while positive shocks to capital intensive industries will do just the opposite. The key requirement is that the appropriation activity be more labor intensive than the average of the productive industries. Our model can account for the curse of natural resources, it explains why aid in kind to war ridden societies may have perverse effects, and how international trade policy should be debated if civil conflict in poorer countries is a concern. Including appropriation activities into a canonic general equilibrium model introduces a social constraint to policy analysis. Thus, we can also account for \"optimal populist\" policies, and \"national development\" strategies (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

To contribute to efforts for aligning climate policy with broader societal goals, specifically those related to sustainable development, we identify the effects of climate mitigation policy on aspects of socioeconomic development that are known determinants of conflict and evaluate the plausibility and importance of potential pathways to armed conflict and political violence. Conditional on preexisting societal tensions and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, we isolate effects on economic performance, income and livelihood, food and energy prices, and land tenure as most likely to increase conflict risks. Climate policy designs may be critical to moderate these risks as different designs can promote more favorable societal outcomes such as equity and inclusion. Coupling research with careful monitoring and evaluation of the intermediate societal effects at early stages of policy implementation will be a critical part of learning and moderating potential conflict risks. Importantly, better characterizing the future conflict risks under climate policy allows for a more comprehensive comparison to the conflict risk if mitigation is not implemented and graver climate damages are experienced.",

We test our argument using a bivariate probit model to simultaneously estimate the risk of repression escalation and the spread of ethnic conflict (1976\u20132009), and find that the likelihood of both increases in the presence of relatively large, territorially concentrated transnational ethnic groups, and that nationalist governments are more likely to escalate repression amidst nearby ethnic violence. Political crises also exacerbate the risk of ethnic conflict spread.",

            "abstract": "In this research note, I argue that scholars of the international diffusion of civil conflict would benefit from directly measuring rebel mobilization prior to the onset of civil war. To better understand the way in which international processes facilitate dissidents overcoming the collective action problem inherent in rebellion, I focus on militant organizations and model the timing of their emergence. I use several data sets on militant groups and violent nonstate actors and rely on Buhaug and Gleditsch\u2019s (2008) causal framework to examine how international conditions predict militant group emergence. While Buhaug and Gleditsch conclude that civil war diffusion is primarily a function of internal conflict in neighboring states, once militant group emergence is substituted in the dependent variable, I observe that global conditions affect rebel collective action. A final selection model links militant groups with civil conflict onset and demonstrates the variable performance of diffusion effects. The results indicate that many rebels mobilize in response to more global events and then escalate their behavior in response to local conditions.",

            "abstract": "Theories of conflict diffusion have long argued that domestic conflict spreads from one country to others. One set of mechanisms explaining this relies on material flows across borders that incite violence in neighboring countries. Another set of mechanisms, however, relies on informational flows. Information about ongoing violence elsewhere triggers strategic learning and demonstration effects in subnational conflict actors which may increase the likelihood that these actors ultimately resort to violence. While the first set of mechanisms can be \u2013 and has been \u2013 assessed using spatial proximity to define connections between countries, this article provides a test of the second mechanism by analyzing communication flows. The article shows that the occurrence of ethnic conflict in a country\u2019s main communication partners significantly increases the probability of domestic ethnic violence, and that this effect operates in conjunction with, and is at least as strong as, the spatial contagion effect of conflict in the geographic neighborhood.",

Drawing on bargaining models of war, I argue refugees are especially likely to cause conflict when they alter the host state's ethnic balance of power. More specifically, I explain why multiple informational and commitment problems arise when refugee flows produce a rapid shift in relative power between ethnic groups. As an empirical strategy, I examine a unique controlled comparison made possible by the influx of Kosovar refugees into Albania and Macedonia in 1999 that eliminates over a dozen competing explanations for civil conflict. I then use process tracing to demonstrate how a change in relative power between ethnic groups fostered violence in Macedonia, whereas the preservation of the ethnic balance facilitated a peaceful refugee flow into Albania. This evidence, though tentative, indicates that a refugee flow's effect on the host state's ethnic balance of power can help explain whether the state experiences peace or conflict.",

This model provides the basis for measuring long-run and short-run effects of civil wars on income per capita growth in the host country and its neighbors. Evidence of significant collateral damage on economic growth in neighboring nations is uncovered. In addition, this damage is attributed to country-specific influences rather than to migration, human capital, or investment factors. As the intensity of the measure used to proxy the conflict increases, there are enhanced neighbor spillovers. Moreover, collateral damage from civil wars to growth is more pronounced in the short run.",

            "abstract": "Over time, states form relationships. These relationships, mosaics of past interactions, provide political leaders with information about how states are likely to behave in the future. Although intuitive, this claim holds important implications for the manner in which we construct and evaluate empirically our expectations about interstate behavior. Empirical analyses of interstate relations implicitly assume that the units of analysis are independent. Theories of interstate interaction are often cast in the absence of historical context. In this article we construct a dynamic model of interstate interaction that we believe will assist scholars in empirical and theoretical studies by incorporating a substantively interpretable historical component into their models of interstate relations. Our conceptual model includes both conflictual and cooperative components, and exhibits the basic properties of growth and decay that characterize dyadic relationships. In an empirical exposition, we derive a continuous measure of interstate conflict from the conflictual component of the model. We rely on Oneal and Russett's (1997) analysis of dyadic conflict for the period 1950\u20131985 as a benchmark, and examine whether the inclusion of our measure of interstate conflict significantly improves our ability to predict militarized conflict. We find empirical support for this hypothesis, indicating that our continuous measure of interstate conflict significantly augments a well-known statistical model of dyadic militarized conflict. Our findings reinforce the assertion that historical processes in interstate relationships represent substantively important elements in models of interstate behavior rather than econometric nuisances.",

            "abstract": "The authors begin the construction of a generalizable theory of casualties and opinion, reexamining the logic employed by Mueller and showing that although human costs are an important predictor of wartime opinion, Mueller's operationalization of those costs solely as the log of cumulative national casualties is problematic and incomplete. The authors argue that temporally proximate costs, captured as marginal casualty figures, are an important additional aspect of human costs and a critical factor in determining wartime opinion. Using Mueller's data on opinion in the Vietnam and Korean wars, the authors find that marginal casualties are important in explaining opinion when casualty accumulation is accelerating, and earlier findings about the importance and generalizability of the log of cumulative casualties as the sole casualty-based predictor of opinion are overstated. Finally, the authors offer some thoughts about other factors that should be considered when building a model of war deaths and domestic opinion.",

This article argues that small arms not only enhance general military capabilities, but also contribute to state capacities necessary for conflict prevention. These two mechanisms are incorporated in a formal model of power shifts. The derived hypotheses are tested on 146 countries for the period 1993\u20132014. Using split-population and penalized fixed-effects logit models as innovative estimation methods for rare-events data, small arms imports are found to have no or even a risk-reducing impact.",

I argue that the locations and movements of civil war battles provide information to both governments and rebels that influences their willingness to engage in mediation and negotiation. By identifying how civil war battles influence the willingness of warring sides to participate in diplomacy, I suggest that it is possible to identify other windows of opportunity for effective conflict management beyond waiting for a conflict to evolve into a hurting stalemate. The results of my analysis of 46 African civil conflicts shows that battle locations, battle velocity, and battle dispersion each influence the occurrence and outcomes of peace talks.",

Drawing on a contest success function model, we show that geographic factors (such as location, terrain, and natural resources) interact with rebel fighting capacity and together play a crucial role in determining the duration of conflict. Using precisely dated duration data in event history models and geographic data for the conflict location, we find that conflicts located at considerable distance from the main government stronghold, along remote international borders and in regions with valuable minerals last substantially longer. In addition, we find that rebel military capacity in its own right increases the prospects of a civil conflict ending within a short time period. Our findings imply that the distances an army must travel to project power, rebel fighting capacity, and characteristics of conflict region affect how a civil war is fought and who will prevail.",

            "abstract": "According to a leading rationalist explanation, war can break out when a large rapid shift of power renders unbelievable a rising state's promise to compensate its declin- ing opponent, causing the latter to attack preventively. This mechanism does not provide a complete and coherent explanation of war because it does not specify how inefficient fighting resolves this commitment problem. We present a complete information model of war as a sequence of battles and show that although opportunities for a negotiated settle- ment arise throughout, the very desirability of peace creates a commitment problem that undermines its likelihood. Because players have incentives to settle as soon as possible, they cannot credibly threaten to fight long enough if an opponent launches a surprise at- tack. This decreases the expected duration and costs of war and causes mutual deterrence to fail. Fighting's sheer destruction improves the credibility of these threats by decreasing the benefits from continuing the war. Equilibrium fighting may involve escalating costs that exceed the value of the stakes by the time peace is negotiated and that leave both players worse off than when the war began.",

            "title": "The Power to Hurt: Costly Conflict with Completely Informed States",
            "abstract": "Because war is costly and risky, states have incentives to negotiate and avoid conflict. The common rationalist explanation is that war results from private information and incentives to misrepresent it. By modeling warfare as a costly bargaining process, I show that inefficient fighting can occur in equilibrium under complete information and very general assumptions favoring peace. Specifically, I assume that peace can be supported in equilibrium and that fighting brings no benefits to either state, only costs. Although there exist agreements that Pareto-dominate the final settlement, states may prefer to fight. The result turns on the ability of states to impose costs on their opponents and bear costs in return. The existence of a range of acceptable settlements and the threat to revert to particularly disadvantageous ones make inefficient equilibria possible. A diminished ability to hurt the enemy, not simply military victory, is a major reason to stop fighting.This article is a shorter version of the first chapter of my dissertation.

            "abstract": "What conditions determine whether a civil war ends in a negotiated settlement or a military victory? The authors address this question by developing an expected utility model of the choice between seeking an immediate settlement or continuing to fight in anticipation of eventual victory. The model implies that the likelihood of a settlement varies with estimates of the probability of winning, the time required to win, the rate at which the costs of conflict accrue, and the payoffs for victory versus settlement. Logistic regression results suggest that a settlement becomes less likely the larger the government's army and more likely the longer the civil war lasts. Payoff and cost variables had no effect on the likelihood of a settlement.",

            "abstract": "Spatial event data is heavily used in contemporary research on political violence. Such data are oftentimes mapped onto grid-cells or administrative regions to draw inference about the determinants of conflict intensity. This setup can identify geographic determinants of violence, but is also prone to methodological issues. Problems resulting from spatial aggregation and dependence have been raised in methodological studies, but are rarely accounted for in applied research. As a consequence, we know little about the empirical relevance of these general problems and the trustworthiness of a popular research design. We address these questions by simulating conflict events based on spatial covariates from seven high-profile conflicts. We find that standard designs fail to deliver reliable inference even under ideal conditions at alarming rates. We also test a set of statistical remedies which strongly improve the results: Controlling for the geographic area of spatial units eliminates an important source of spurious correlation. In time-series analyses, the same result can be achieved with unit-level fixed effects. Under outcome diffusion, spatial lag models with area controls produce most reliable inference. When those are computationally intractable, geographically larger aggregations lead to similar improvements. Generally, all analyses should be performed at two separate levels of geographic aggregation. To facilitate future research into geographic methods, we release the Simple Conflict Event Generator (SCEG) developed for this analysis.",

I explore the temporal patterns in the predictors of conflict in data on European conflict between 1870 and 2001, using an endogenous Markov chain Monte Carlo Poisson change-point model. I find that the period can be divided into two time periods, different in terms of the direction of the effect of the main conflict predictors. While democracy has a positive effect on conflict in the period between 1870 and 1938, it has a negative effect from 1938 to 2001. Likewise, trade initially has no impact on conflict, but later exerts a pacifying effect. Post-estimation analyses suggest that such patterns are best explained by the externalization of contractual norms, which is consistent with economic norms theory.",

            "abstract": "Two studies question whether economic interdependence promotes peace, arguing that previous research has not adequately considered the endogeneity of trade. Using simultaneous equations to capture the reciprocal effects, they report that trade does not reduce conflict, though conflict reduces trade. These results are puzzling on logical grounds. Trade should make conflict less likely, ceteris paribus, if interstate violence adversely affects commerce; otherwise, national leaders are acting irrationally. In re-analyzing the authors\u2019 data, this article shows that trade does promote peace once the gravity model is incorporated into the analysis of conflict. Both trade and conflict are influenced by nations\u2019 sizes and the distance separating them, so these fundamental exogenous factors must be included in models of conflict as well as trade. One study errs in omitting distance when explaining militarized disputes. The other does not adequately control for the effect of size (or power). When these theoretically informed changes are made, the pacific benefit of trade again appears. In new simultaneous analyses, the article confirms that trade promotes peace and conflict contemporaneously reduces commerce, even with extensive controls for traders\u2019 rational expectations of violence. Previous studies that address the endogeneity of trade by controlling for the years of peace \u2014 as virtually all have done since 1999 \u2014 have not overstated the benefit of interdependence. Commerce promotes peace because violence has substantial costs, whether these are paid prospectively or contemporaneously.",

            "abstract": "How do domestic political institutions affect the propensity to initiate international conflict? We improve theoretical understanding of and empirical knowledge on this question. We describe three major types of democratic institutional characteristics that have been hypothesized to increase the constraints on conflict initiation: public electoral participation, intra-legislative factors, and a stronger legislature in relation to the executive. Using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model to analyze 37 democracies in the period 1919-1992, we find that higher political participation levels decrease the likelihood of initiating an international dispute and that neither the number of parties nor the nature of the ruling coalition affects the likelihood of initiating a dispute. The evidence is mixed on whether variation in executive-legislative constraints makes initiation more likely. These findings highlight the significance of public consent for the formation of democratic foreign policy.",

However, both break down, although in different ways, when treated as the basis for elaborating testable hypotheses and further theory. Civil society is most useful in polemical or normative contexts, but attempts to distinguish it from other sectors of society typically break down in unresolvable boundary disputes over just what constitutes civil society and what differentiates it from \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cmarket.\u201d Work by Robert Putnam and others has assimilated social capital to the civic culture model, using it as just another label for the norms and values of the empirical democratic theory of the 1950s. This strategy undermines the empirical value of James Coleman and Pierre Bourdieu's useful social relational concept.",

            "abstract": "Society-centered views of political and economic transformation have never held the unchallenged sway in Latin America that they have in North America. The prevalence of \u201corganic statist\u201d models of society that assume a central and relatively autonomous role for the state has affected both policy makers and social scientists. Beginning in the late 1960s, focus on the state became particularly intense. The erosion of the intellectual credibility of the society-centered \u201cmodernization\u201d model of political and economic development coincided with the apparent exhaustion of both industrialization based on import substitution and the associated populist and parliamentary political regimes that were associated with it. The assumptions of modernization theory that liberal democratic regimes would be inexorably produced by the process of industrialization was replaced by a new preoccupation with the ways in which the state apparatus might become a central instrument for both the repression of subordinate classes and the reorientation of the process of industrial development. This new concern is perhaps best exemplified in the seminal work of Guillermo O'Donnell on bureaucratic authoritarian (BA) regimes. A BA regime was associated with (if not necessarily responsible for) an impressive episode of industrialization (in the Brazilian case). Such regimes also proved to be extremely effective at fragmenting, atomizing, and inhibiting potential oppositional collectivities. The initial period of the BA was one in which the civil society lost its capacity to generate new political and economic initiatives while the power of the state grew. Thus, analysis of the actions and initiatives of groups operating within the state apparatus became a central focus of social science research.",

Recent research has shown how the causal mechanism may lie in the economic norm of contracting, as democracy becomes valued as the best means for sustaining a nonpredatory government that enforces contracts with impartiality. We extend this research to investigate if norms of economic contracting in societies give rise to, and strengthen, the democratic civil liberties of free speech and association. Drawing on the World Bank\u2019s Financial Structure Database and data on civil liberties from the Varieties of Democracy dataset, analyses of most countries from 1961 to 2019 show that the economic norms of contracting have significant positive effects on the civil liberties of free speech and association and press freedom. With instrumental variable regression, we statistically isolate the causation from contracting to these civil liberties. This study pinpoints that contracting economic activities may strengthen the foundation of civil liberties in countries.",
