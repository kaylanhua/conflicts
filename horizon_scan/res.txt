## Literature Review on the Use of Tree-Based Algorithms in Modeling Armed Civil Conflicts

The past two decades have witnessed a surge in the application of tree-based algorithms for conflict analysis, prediction, and understanding the nuanced dynamics that lead to armed civil conflicts. This literature review will synthesize findings from a collection of research efforts spanning over 15 years (2005-2023), appraising not only the evolution of methodologies but also the effectiveness of these techniques in the realm of conflict studies.

### Early Adoption and Methodological Enhancements

In the earlier stages, tree-based algorithms were recognized for their performance superiority over traditional methods such as logistic regression. Weidmann (2008) noted the challenge of predicting rare events, which he addressed using an ensemble of classifiers, underscoring the utility of decision trees in conjunction with other algorithms. This innovation was pivotal in allowing for a more nuanced understanding and prediction of conflict onset.

Indeed, the potential for tree-based models to account for non-linear relations and interactions among covariates in predicting the onset and severity of conflicts was highlighted in research by Montgomery (2018) and M. Ward (2005), who argued that traditional models often failed to capture complex relationships inherent in conflict data. Ward particularly critiqued the traditional logistic regression models for their insufficient predictive power in forecasting civil conflict onset.

### Tackling Rare Events and Class Imbalance

D. Muchlinski (2016) compared Random Forest with logistic regression models explicitly in the context of rare, class-imbalanced data concerning civil war onset. The study highlighted Random Forest’s superior out-of-sample predictive accuracy, establishing a preference for tree-based algorithms in predicting such low-probability but high-impact events.

Likewise, exploring different techniques to overcome class imbalance, Musumba (2021) compared various machine learning (ML) algorithms and introduced the use of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve prediction in such situations. The findings posited Gradient Tree Boosting as an effective algorithm, particularly when prioritizing recall as the performance metric.

### Advanced Ensemble Approaches and Multi-Model Forecasting

Evolving from the implementation of single tree-based models, Ettensperger (2021) showcased the strength of ensemble averaging with multiple tree-based algorithms. By using diverse data configurations and accounting for structural, economic, political, and social factors, this framework significantly enhanced the quality of conflict intensity predictions.

Håvard Hegre (2022) further advanced this domain via an escalation prediction competition that sourced innovative methodologies from international teams. This communal research effort underscored the importance of blending various contributions to optimally model conflict developments, emphasizing that an ensemble of diverse tree-based models improved prediction capabilities.

### Broader Application and Contemporary Approaches

More recently, Xie (2023) utilized Boosted Regression Trees to model the risk of armed conflict across sub-Saharan Africa, incorporating background contextual factors as prime determinants and accurately depicting spatiotemporal distributions of armed conflict risk with high performance.

Metternich (2019) introduced an actor-centric approach, emphasizing the significance of focusing on the agents of armed violence—government-rebel dyads. In this study, random forests were adept at distinguishing between different levels of conflict severity, highlighting the advantage of specialized predictors that consider organizational characteristics and conflict networks.

### Considerations of Socio-Economic and Demographic Factors

Schellens (2020) discussed the role of natural resources in violent conflicts. The study showed that machine learning models, including Random Forests, can capture interactions between socio-economic conditions and natural resources, revealing nuanced predictors of conflict such as water access and food security.

Population dynamics were also of interest, as Goldstone (2002) and Floros (2008) described the complex interplay between demographic factors and the onset and nature of conflicts. Their research suggested that demographic changes and pressures could be a significant driver for both inter-state and intra-state conflicts.

### Limitations and New Directions

Henrickson (2020) and Toukan (2019) acknowledged the current limitations in the field, noting the lack of a comprehensive measure for the expected costs of war and the complex relationship between a state's international disputes, rivalries, and civil war onset. These gaps signify a potential direction for future research where tree-based models may provide further insights.

### Conclusion

During the exploration of various models' effectiveness in civil conflict analysis, it is evident that tree-based algorithms have evolved to address the inherent complexities and rare-event nature of armed conflicts. From dealing with class imbalance to the integration of economic, social, and geopolitical variables, tree-based methods like Random Forest, Gradient Tree Boosting, and ensemble models have been increasingly favored for their robustness and flexibility (Musumba, 2021; Ettensperger, 2021).

Combining these models' inherent strengths with novel approaches focused on specific actors, context, and ensemble methods have made notable advancements in predicting conflict-related outcomes (Metternich, 2019; Hegre, 2022). Moreover, the incorporation of demographic and socio-economic factors has further enriched the analytical capacity of tree-based algorithms in understanding conflict dynamics (Goldstone, 2002; Schellens, 2020).

Overall, tree-based models have profoundly impacted the political science arena, offering more nuanced predictions and contributing valuable insights for policymakers focused on conflict prevention and resolution.
