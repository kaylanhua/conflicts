      "Title: Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data\n",
      "Abstract: The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.\n",

      "Abstract: Machine learning deals with the development of algorithms for classification and prediction. However, these algorithms have only in rare cases been used in political science. This poster demonstrates the application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to the prediction of conflict. In order to address the rare events problem, I use an ensemble of classifiers built on subsets of the training data. These subsets include all positive cases, and a random selection of negative ones. Although I focus primarily on decision tree learning, the proposed method can be used in conjunction with different classification algorithms in order to improve the prediction of conflict onset.\n",

      "Title: Forecasting conflict using a diverse machine-learning ensemble: Ensemble averaging with multiple tree-based algorithms and variance promoting data configurations\n",
      "Abstract: Abstract The article examines the potential of multi-model ensemble learning techniques for conflict research and applies an ensemble averaging framework to the prediction task of the 2020 ViEWS armed conflict forecasting competition. The goal is to predict changes of conflict intensity in fifty-four African countries for 6 months into the future. The presented ensemble combines six individual models, using two tree-based learning algorithms, incorporating two distinct data foundations and two geographical selections into a unified forecasting framework. In one of the two applied datasets, the combination of conflict variables from recent months is implemented to train for inter-temporal connections of previous conflict levels. The second dataset contains important structural, economic, political, and social information relevant for each individual case. Both datasets are used to predict changes in conflict levels. The framework structure and the combination method are presented in detail, and the prediction results for both test periods between 2014–2016 and 2016–2019 are evaluated regarding their quality. The effect of the ensemble structure and the performance of all individual components is comprehensively examined. Real forecasts over the timespan of six months into the future are presented for the upcoming months of October 2020 through March 2021 generated from data available until August 2020. The paper concludes with the presentation and examination of three selected case forecasts for Egypt, Cameroon, and Mozambique. El artículo examina el potencial de las técnicas de aprendizaje de conjuntos multimodelos para la investigación de conflictos y aplica un marco de promedio de conjuntos a la tarea de predicción del concurso de previsión de conflictos armados; ViEWS 2020. La meta es predecir los cambios en la intensidad de los conflictos en cincuenta y cuatro países africanos durante seis meses en el futuro. El conjunto presentado combina seis modelos individuales, que utilizan dos algoritmos de aprendizaje basados en árboles, y que incorporan dos bases de datos distintas y dos selecciones geográficas en un marco de previsión unificado.

      "Title: Prevention Is Better Than Cure: Machine Learning Approach to Conflict Prediction in Sub-Saharan Africa\n",
      "Abstract: This article offers policymakers and researchers pragmatic and sustainable approaches to identify and mitigate conflict threats by looking beyond p-values and plausible instruments. We argue that predicting conflict successfully depends on the choice of algorithms, which, if chosen accurately, can reduce economic and social instabilities caused by post-conflict reconstruction. After collating data with variables linked to conflict, we used a grid level dataset of 5928 observations spanning 48 countries across sub-Saharan Africa to predict civil conflict. The goals of the study were to assess the performance of supervised classification machine learning (ML) algorithms in comparison with logistic model, assess the implication of selecting a specific performance metric on policy initiatives, and evaluate the value of interpretability of the selected model. After comparing class imbalance resampling methods, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to improve out-of-sample prediction for the trained model. The results indicate that if our selected performance metric is recall, gradient tree boosting is the best algorithm; however, if precision or F1 score is the selected metric, then the multilayer perceptron algorithm produces the best model.\n",

      "Title: Revisiting the Contested Role of Natural Resources in Violent Conflict Risk through Machine Learning\n",
      "Abstract: The integrated character of the sustainable development goals in Agenda 2030, as well as research in environmental security, flag that sustainable peace requires sustainable and conflict-sensitive natural resource use. The precise relationship between the risk for violent conflict and natural resources remains contested because of the interplay with socio-economic variables. This paper aims to improve the understanding of natural resources’ role in the risk of violent conflicts by accounting for complex interactions with socio-economic conditions. Conflict data was analysed with machine learning techniques, which can account for complex patterns, such as variable interactions. More commonly used logistic regression models are compared with neural network models and random forest models. The results indicate that a country’s natural resource features are important predictors of its risk for violent conflict and that they interact with socio-economic conditions. Based on these empirical results and the existing literature, we interpret that natural resources can be root causes of violent intrastate conflict, and that signals from natural resources leading to conflict risk are reflected in and influenced by interacting socio-economic conditions. More specifically, the results show that variables such as access to water and food security are important predictors of conflict, while resource rents and oil and ore exports are relatively less important than other natural resource variables, contrasting what prior research has suggested. Given the potential of natural resource features to act as an early warning for violent conflict, we argue that natural resources should be included in conflict risk models for conflict prevention.\n",

      "Title: Predicting the costs of war\n",
      "Abstract: The expected cost of war is a foundational concept in the study of international conflict. However, the field currently lacks a measure of the expected costs of war, and thereby any measure of the bargaining range. In this paper, I develop a proxy for the expected costs of war by focusing on one aspect of war costs – battle deaths. I train a variety of machine learning algorithms on battle deaths for all countries participating in fatal military disputes and interstate wars between 1816 and 2007 in order to maximize out-of-sample predictive performance. The best performing model (random forest) improves performance over that of a null model by 25% and a linear model with all predictors by 9%. I apply the random forest to all interstate dyads in the Correlates of War dataverse from 1816 to 2007 in order to produce an estimate of the expected costs of war for all existing country pairs in the international system. The resulting measure, which I refer to as Dispute Casualty Expectations, can be used to fully explore the implications of the bargaining model of war, as well as allow applied researchers to develop and test new theories in the study of international relations.\n",

      "Title: Predictive inference with random forests: A new perspective on classical analyses\n",
      "Abstract: Despite the number of problems that can occur when core model assumptions are violated, nearly all quantitative political science research relies on inflexible regression models that require a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables for valid inference. We argue that nonparametric statistical learning methods like random forests are capable of combining the benefits of interpretability and flexibility. Recent work has shown that under suitable regularity conditions, averaging over predictions made by subsampled random forests produces asymptotically normal predictions. After estimating the variance, this property can be exploited to produce hypothesis tests and confidence intervals analogous to those produced within a parametric framework. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by replicating an important study on the determinants of civil war onset and show that subtle nonlinear relationships are uncovered, providing a new perspective on these ongoing research questions.\n",

      "Title: International politics by other means: External sources of civil war\n",
      "Abstract: The literature on civil wars has recently turned towards their international context but lacks an account for how conflict beyond a state’s borders contributes to civil war onset. I argue that interstate rivalries can increase the risk of civil war in other states when rivals come to associate the foreign-policy orientation of other states with their own security. I present three pathways through which rivals increase the risk of civil war in other states. First, competition between rivals creates a ratchet effect by which the prospect of one’s involvement in a conflict makes it more likely that the other becomes involved. This dynamic makes support easier to secure and lowers the expected costs of war for governments and opposition groups. Second, rivals encourage domestic polarization as parties attempt to capture their influence, making domestic conflicts more intractable. Third, uncertainty over the potential for intervention by rivals increases the risk of miscalculation. I test the implications of the theory with novel spatial measures of interstate conflict and rivalry. Using logistic regressions and random forests, I find that being in the neighborhood of interstate rivals can increase a state’s risk of civil war.\n",

      "Abstract: Though used frequently in machine learning, boosted decision trees are largely unused in political science, despite many useful properties. We explain how to use one variant of boosted decision trees, AdaBoosted decision trees (ADTs), for social science predictions. We illustrate their use by examining a well-known political prediction problem, predicting U.S. Supreme Court rulings. We find that our ADT approach outperforms existing predictive models. We also provide two additional examples of the approach, one predicting the onset of civil wars and the other predicting county-level vote shares in U.S. presidential elections.\n",

There are several potential reasons for this. We provide a survey of three major efforts to understand the onset of civil conflict. We use prediction to gauge the effectiveness of these statistical models. We offer some lessons for the use of case control methods and forecasting as theoretical endeavors in the study of conflict.

      "Abstract: Abstract Recent research on the forecasting of violence has mostly focused on predicting the presence or absence of conflict in a given location, while much less attention has been paid to predicting changes in violence. We organized a prediction competition to forecast changes in state-based violence both for the true future and for a test partition. We received contributions from 15 international teams. The models leverage new insight on the targeted problem, insisting on methodological advances, new data and features, and innovative frameworks which contribute to the research frontiers from various perspectives. This article introduces the competition, presents the main innovations fostered by the teams and discusses ways to further expand and improve upon this wisdom of the crowd. We show that an optimal modeling approach builds on a good number of the presented contributions and new evaluation metrics are needed to capture substantial models’ improvements and reward unique insights.

      "Title: Predicting Conflict\n",
      "Abstract: This paper studies the performance of alternative prediction models for conflict. The analysis contrasts the performance of conventional approaches based on predicted probabilities generated by binary response regressions and random forests with two unconventional classification algorithms. The unconventional algorithms are calibrated specifically to minimize a prediction loss function penalizing Type 1 and Type 2 errors: (1) an algorithm that selects linear combinations of correlates of conflict to minimize the prediction loss function, and (2) an algorithm that chooses a set of thresholds for the same variables, together with the number of breaches of thresholds that constitute a prediction of conflict, that minimize the prediction loss function. The paper evaluates the predictive power of these approaches in a set of conflict and non-conflict episodes constructed from a large country-year panel of developing countries since 1977, and finds substantial differences in the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance of these alternative algorithms. The threshold classifier has the best overall predictive performance, and moreover has advantages in simplicity and transparency that make it well suited for policy-making purposes. The paper explores the implications of these findings for the World Bank's classification of fragile and conflict-affected states.\n",

      "Title: Population and Security: How Demographic Change Can Lead to Violent Conflict\n",
      "Abstract: \"While the marked decrease in population growth in many countries and regions is good news for those concerned about global population, it offers no clear relief for concerns about the security implications of population change.\" As we cross into the new century, the world seems finally to have turned the corner on population growth. A combination of increased education for women, national and international support for policies of population planning and the spread of economic development and accompanying movement along the demographic transition frontier have led to falling population growth rates around the world. Whether among the behemoths--China and India--or among the smaller but rapidly growing nations--such as Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Malawi--population growth rates have dropped dramatically in the last decade. (1) Yet while population growth rates have dropped around the world, they remain high in some areas. In particular, many nations in the Middle East, southeast Asia and central and northern Africa still are growing at nearly 3 percent per year, a growth rate that leads to a doubling of population in approximately 25 years. Moreover, although in most countries the rate of population growth has slowed, the absolute number of people being added to the world's population has not; the large number of women of childbearing age in the developing world, carrying the momentum of past population growth, ensure that even while growth rates fall as a percentage of the existing population, the number of new births each year continues to rise. For example, although China's growth rate has fallen to 1.0 percent per year, China will still grow by 10 to 11 million people per year for the next 15 years. The world as a whole will add roughly 80 million people per year, or another 960 million (that is, another India) in the next dozen years. (2) DEMOGRAPHY AND SECURITY: KEY FINDINGS After nearly three decades of debate and analysis, stemming from Myron Weiner's (1971) path-breaking study, scholars are beginning to develop much clearer answers to the complex questions regarding how population changes affect security concerns. Those answers can be summarized briefly in the following propositions, each of which we shall treat in greater detail below: 1) While population growth often brings degradation of forests, water resources, arable land and other local resources, such environmental degradation is not a major or pervasive cause of international wars, ethnic wars or revolutionary conflicts. Such degradation often brings misery, yet such misery does not generally trigger the elite alienation and opposition to the government necessary for large-scale violence to occur. 2) Population growth can give rise to conflicts over increasingly scarce resources, such as farmland, if those conflicts involve elites seeking to take resources from popular groups, or competition between elite factions for control of those resources. However, what determines whether violent conflict arises are the relationships among popular groups, elites and the state, and particularly whether the state has the capacity to channel and moderate elite conflicts. Only where elite conflicts or popular resistance to elite actions overwhelm weak states do major conflicts arise. 3) While overall population growth and population density do not generally predict political risks, a number of distinct kinds of demographic changes--rapid growth in the labor force in slow-growing economies, a rapid increase in educated youth aspiring to elite positions when such positions are scarce, unequal population growth rates between different ethnic groups, urbanization that exceeds employment growth and migrations that change the local balance among major ethnic groups--do appear to increase the risks of violent internal political and ethnic conflicts. In addition, there is some evidence that countries with larger populations have greater risks of both armed conflict and state repression. …\n",

      "Title: Civil war termination ∗\n",
      "Abstract: We argue that commitment problems in the construction of power-sharing arrangements tend to make civil con icts all or nothing ghts for control of central or regional government. An implication is that civil wars will tend to end with military victory occasioned by a shock to one side's relative power or cost tolerance. We code the 119 terminated civil con icts listed by the Political Instability Task Force using a new scheme that recognizes conceptual differences in the meaning of military victory and negotiated settlements for civil wars where the rebel groups seek power at the center versus in a region. We nd that power-sharing is quite rare in center-seeking wars, and somewhat more common in separatist con icts (in the form of regional autonomy agreements). Finally, we examine case narratives for 30 randomly selected con icts. We nd that shocks to relative power in the form of entry or exit of foreign support for one side commonly caused civil war termination. We also nd some evidence that changes in government leadership, possibly the result of shocks to cost tolerance, associates with civil war termination in our set of random narratives.\n",

      "Title: Tree-Based Models for Political Science Data\n",
      "Abstract: Political scientists often find themselves analyzing data sets with a large number of observations, a large number of variables, or both. Yet, traditional statistical techniques fail to take full advantage of the opportunities inherent in “big data,” as they are too rigid to recover nonlinearities and do not facilitate the easy exploration of interactions in high-dimensional data sets. In this article, we introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques that may, in some circumstances, be more appropriate than traditional methods for confronting these data challenges. In particular, tree models are very effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates. We introduce the basic logic of tree-based models, provide an overview of the most prominent methods in the literature, and conduct three analyses that illustrate how the methods can be implemented while highlighting both their advantages and limitations. Replication Materials: The data, code, and any additional materials required to replicate all analyses in this article are available on the American Journal of Political Science Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8ZJBLI. Social science scholars often work with data sets containing a large number of observations, many potential covariates, or (increasingly) both. Indeed, political scientists now regularly analyze data with levels of complexity unimaginable just two decades ago. Widely used surveys, for instance, interview tens of thousands of respondents about hundreds of topics. Scholars of institutions can quickly assemble data sets with thousands of observations using resources like the Comparative Agendas Project. Moreover, new measurement methods, such as text analysis, have combined with data sources, such as Twitter, to generate databases of almost unmanageable sizes. It is clear that political science, like all areas of the social sciences, will increasingly have access to a deluge of data so vast that it will dwarf everything that has come before. What statistical methods are needed in this datasaturated world? Surely, there is no one correct answer. Yet, just as surely, traditional statistical models are not always equipped to take full advantage of new data sources. Traditional models—largely variants of linear regressions—are ideal for evaluating theories that imply specific functional forms relating outcomes to predictors. In particular, they excel in their ability to leverage assumptions about the data-generating process, or DGP (additivity, linearity in the parameters, homoskedasticity, Jacob M.

Santiago Olivella is Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Hamilton Hall 361, CB 3265, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 (olivella@unc.edu). etc.) to make valid inferences despite inherent data limitations. Although appropriate when testing theories that conform with these assumptions, standard models are often insufficiently flexible to capture nuances in the data—such as complex nonlinear functional forms and deep interactions—when no clear a priori expectations exist. In this article, we introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques from the machine learning literature. We argue that, under specific circumstances, regression and classification tree models are an appropriate standard choice for analyzing high-dimensional data sets. In particular, past research has shown tree-based methods to be very useful for making accurate predictions when the underlying DGP includes nonlinearities, discontinuities, and interactions among many covariates. Further, tree models require few assumptions. Rather than imposing a presumed structure on the DGP, tree-based methods allow the data to “speak for themselves.” Thus, our goal in this article is to introduce political scientists to this promising family of methods, which are well suited for today’s data analysis demands. In the next sections, we discuss the promise and perils of high-dimensional, “large”-N data sets and introduce the basic logic of tree models. We then provide an overview of the most prominent methods in the literature.

      "Title: Modeling analysis of armed conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa, 2000–2019\n",
      "Abstract: Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered frequent outbreaks of armed conflict since the end of the Cold War. Although several efforts have been made to understand the underlying causes of armed conflict and establish an early warning mechanism, there is still a lack of a comprehensive assessment approach to model the incidence risk of armed conflict well. Based on a large database of armed conflict events and related spatial datasets covering the period 2000–2019, this study uses a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach to model the spatiotemporal distribution of armed conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of accuracy indicates that the simulated models obtain high performance with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) mean value of 0.937 and an area under the precision recall curves (PR-AUC) mean value of 0.891. The result of the relative contribution indicates that the background context factors (i.e., social welfare and the political system) are the main driving factors of armed conflict risk, with a mean relative contribution of 92.599%. By comparison, the climate change-related variables have relatively little effect on armed conflict risk, accounting for only 7.401% of the total. These results provide novel insight into modelling the incidence risk of armed conflict, which may help implement interventions to prevent and minimize the harm of armed conflict.\n",

      "Title: Migrant-based youth bulges and social conflict in urban sub-Saharan Africa\n",
      "Abstract: Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced relatively high population growth, which raises concerns about the potential contribution of large young cohorts, termed ‘youth bulges’, to unrest. Youth bulges, under the right circumstances, can expand productivity and boost economic growth, but they have also been found to enable civil war, corruption, and democracy collapse, especially where resources are scarce. Objective: This paper considers youth bulges characterised by high proportions of rural‒urban migrants and examines their effects on the likelihood of social conflict in urban sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2013. Methods: United Nations data on urban and rural populations by age and sex is combined with the Social Conflict Analysis Database to create a cross-section time series dataset. Negative binomial models are used to examine the relationship between youth bulges and conflict using country level fixed effects. Results: The study finds that a migrant-based youth bulge does not increase the likelihood of urban social conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, female youth bulges, often neglected when studying conflict, are found to increase the likelihood of conflict. Conclusions: The overall disassociation between young rural‒urban migrants and social conflict is encouraging. All the same, women were found to play a role in conflict, and women should therefore be considered in future studies. Contribution: This article characterises the composition of youth bulges – an important factor that has previously been ignored ‒ by examining whether youth bulges composed largely of rural‒urban migrants are more likely to increase the likelihood of conflict in urban sub-Saharan Africa.\n",

      "Title: Reviewing the Interactions between Conflict and Demographic Trends in the Occupied Palestinian Territories: The Case of The Gaza Strip\n",
      "Abstract: This paper reviews the interactions between conflict and demographic trends in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), and provides an analysis of The Gaza Strip. Palestinian society has experienced momentous demographic transition over the past century, as well as recurrent waves of displacement and outbreaks of conflict and violence over the last decade. The enclave has witnessed demographic changes, with the emergence and rule of Hamas, repeated wars, and, since 2007, the unlawful blockade of The Gaza Strip. The United Nations (UN) has warned that, living conditions in Gaza are deteriorating faster than forecast, and are predicted to become dire by 2020. This paper provides a brief review of theories linking conflict and demography, followed by an introduction to the historical and contemporary context of The Gaza Strip. An in-depth analysis of the impact that conflict has on the demographic structure of Palestinian society in The Gaza Strip, focusing on the factors behind high fertility rates, population growth trends, and the drivers of migration. The analysis offered builds upon interviews with Palestinian experts, and Palestinian asylum-seekers in Greece, Poland, U.K. and Sweden, in addition to data published by the Palestinian Statistics Bureau Centre and research articles focusing on The Gaza Strip. The paper concludes that, the Palestinian reconciliation agreement should take priority over the population and the economy.\n",

      "Title: Of, by, and for the people? How demographic pressure affects participation in inter- and intra -state conflicts\n",
      "Abstract: Under what circumstances do demographic factors motivate states to engage in inter-state conflict, and when do these factors lead to civil conflict? IR and comparative politics scholars have investigated the links between population and conflict, but two common limitations are common in such studies. First, scholars have failed to differentiate between the demographic causes of inter-state (between countries) and civil conflict, as these conflict processes are not often addressed in the same study. Second, scholars have failed to define and explain adequately the difference between demographic change and demographic pressure.This project addresses these two limitations in the current research. First, I propose a second-image explanation of conflict which rests on the contractual relationship between the state and society. As the state collects rents from society to provide services, so society expects services for rents paid. When this relationship is disrupted by demographic pressure, states must respond to forestall regime change or state breakdown. If the state cannot extract rents internally, they may pursue external options to acquire additional resources. Failure to attain resources may result in internal conflict as domestic groups simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness of the government in meeting societal demands.The second limitation this project addresses is the conceptual imprecision of 'demographic pressure'. I distinguish between demographic change and demographic pressure by accounting for state capacity. All states experience demographic change, but many states have the capacity to adapt to these changes. States experiencing economic hardship, however, face 'pressure' when demographic changes cannot be accommodated easily with existing economic stagnation.I utilize two large cross-national datasets, covering the post-World War II period to test my theoretical link between demographic pressure and inter-state and civil conflict while controlling for state, dyadic and systemic factors. The empirical analysis supports my primary hypotheses that demographic pressure is associated with an increased likelihood of both inter- and intra-state conflict. Additional hypotheses to determine more specific conditions under which this increased likelihood holds generated mixed results; however, the robustness of the demographic pressure measure confirms that demographic pressure is an important predictor of both civil and inter-state conflict.\n",

      "Title: EDGS WORKING PAPER Number 4 “ Violent Corruption and Violent Lobbying : The Logic ( s ) of Cartel-State Conflict in Mexico , Brazil and Colombia ”\n",
      "Abstract: Why do drug traffickers fight states? In Mexico, Colombia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, cartel state conflict has been just as lethal, disruptive, and prolonged as civil war. Yet rebel insurgents fight for and sometimes win formal concessions or outright victory. Why fight the state if, like cartels, you seek neither to topple nor secede from it? More puzzling, recent militarized state crackdowns on cartels have led to sharply divergent outcomes: on one hand, the conflagration that has engulfed Mexico since 2006, on the other, the surprising success of Rio de Janeiro’s Pacification strategy. Why do some crackdowns lead to violent blowback, while others successfully curtail cartel-state conflict? I distinguish the logic of violent lobbyingdirect pressure on leaders to change de jure policy-from violent corruption-epitomized by drug lord Pablo Escobar’s phrase ‘plata o plomo?’ (bribe or bullet?) and argue that the latter has been more central to cartel violence in Mexico and Brazil. A formal model illustrates how bribe negotiations can turn violent, and highlights a fundamental dilemma: states cannot crack down on traffickers without inadvertently giving corrupt enforcers additional leverage to extract illicit rents. I find that when corruption is rampant and repression is not conditional on cartels’s use of violence, crackdowns give cartels increased incentive to fight back. I then draw on case study evidence to argue that Rio de Janeiro’s recent turn to violence-reduction over eradication has induced cartels there to switch to more peaceful strategies, while Mexico’s insistence on pursuing all cartels without distinction has driven sharp increases in cartel-state violence.

      "Title: The Political Consequences of Civil Wars\n",
      "Abstract: What are the political consequences of civil wars? In this paper we argue that these cannot be deduced simply from either the preferences of initial power holders or rebels because civil wars mobilize new groups. This is particularly the case in developing countries with urban bias and weak states where rural elites are often discriminated against. Such elites have the most to lose from rural insurgencies, so they have an incentive to form paramilitary groups to ght the rebellion. Once formed, such groups may forge a coalition with rural elites making them much more powerful politically even to the extent of changing the post civil war political equilibrium and reversing urban bias. However, the paramilitaries may become autonomous and independently contest power. We develop a model of an ongoing civil war where the rural elite may form a paramilitary group. We study the extent to which rural elites are able to collaborate with a paramilitary group to increase their political power. The model suggests that the rural elite will be able to collaborate when the presence of paramilitaries do not generate too much collateral damageand when urban bias is high. Paramilitaries are willing to collaborate with rural elites when it is di¢ cult for them to independently contest power and when urban bias is low. Civil wars lead to political change when urban bias is relatively high, the state is di¢ cult to overthrow and when there is intense rural class conict so that paramilitaries are relatively benecial for the rural elite. We illustrate these outcomes via the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Colombia. Extremely Preliminary Comments Welcome!

      "Abstract: We introduce an actor-centric approach to predict the severity of conflict one and six months into the future. We argue that the prediction of conflict severity needs to focus on the actors that are responsible for conducting armed violence. Hence, we predict the severity of conflict in government-rebel organization dyads. Our predictors focus especially on rebel organization characteristics, behavior, and the conflict networks actors are embedded in. Our statistical learning approach relies on random forests to predict the severity of conflict. We demonstrate that our model performs especially well distinguishing high levels of severity from very low levels.\n",
