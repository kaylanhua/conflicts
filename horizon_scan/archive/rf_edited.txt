Tree-based algorithms have gained traction over the last two decades as a powerful set of tools for modeling and predicting armed civil conflicts. The use of these algorithms reflects an ongoing methodological shift in the field of conflict analysis—from classic, theory-driven approaches towards more data-driven, machine learning techniques. This literature review synthesizes research papers exploring the use of tree-based algorithms to forecast armed conflicts, focusing on their methodologies, evolution, and effectiveness.

Early explorations into machine learning for conflict prediction, like the work of Weidmann (2008), recognized that traditional methods such as logistic regression were often unsuited for the "rare events" nature of armed conflicts. Weidmann's use of bagging with decision trees introduced ensembles to overcome class imbalances—a significant step that would inform future research.

Muchlinski (2016) compared Random Forests with logistic regression variants and found the former to be superior in out-of-sample predictions of civil war onset. By harnessing the algorithmic power to manage high-dimensional data without assuming linearity, Random Forests allowed for capturing complex interactions within conflict data. The pursuit of improved forecasts continued with scholarly efforts, including Henrickson (2020), who used machine learning techniques, notably Random Forests, to gauge the expected costs of war, thus expanding the potential of the tree-based algorithms beyond conflict onset to the assessment of conflict intensity.

Alongside methodology advancements, Ettensperger (2021) introduced an ensemble averaging framework to predict conflict intensity changes, combining multiple tree-based algorithms models and diverse datasets. This ensemble approach, recognizing the interplay between conflict dynamics and socio-economic structures, offered nuanced insights into the predictive capacity of tree-based algorithms.

Fascination with the algorithms' predictive power was furthered by Musumba (2021), who directly compared the performance of various supervised classification machine learning algorithms, including gradient tree boosting, against more conventional statistical approaches. SMOTE, a synthetic over-sampling technique, was highlighted for its efficacy in resolving the class imbalance issue, illustrating the continuous methodological enhancements being made within the field.

Schellens (2020) contributed by delving into the contested role of natural resources in violent conflict. By applying tree-based models, she unearthed the intricate interconnections with socio-economic variables, advancing the interpretive capacity of machine learning over logistic regression models. This work shed light on the nuanced role that features like access to resources could play in conflict prediction models.

McAlexander (2020) further advocated for the use of nonparametric methods like Random Forests. His work demonstrated the potential to uncover subtle nonlinear relationships, affording a fresh perspective on determinants of civil war onset, challenging the preference for traditional linear models.

Trends within the literature shifted to incorporate external dimensions, as illustrated by Toukan (2019), who leveraged logistic regressions and Random Forests to study the international context of civil conflicts. The innovative framing of interstate rivalries suggested that geographic proximity to rivalries increased a state's risk of civil war, illustrating how tree-based models can enrich understanding of complex geopolitical factors in conflict dynamics.

Kaufman (2019), pushing the boundaries of political science prediction, applied AdaBoosted decision trees to several political phenomena, including civil war onset prediction. The success of these boosted decision trees called attention to their wide-ranging applicability and led to further considerations of their policy relevance.

Ward (2005), one of the earlier studies in this collection, provided a critical reflection on quantitative models of conflict, underscoring the challenges faced by statistical models in accurately predicting civil conflict onsets. This retrospective view highlights the progress made and the need for continual refinement in modeling strategies.

As demonstrated by Hegre (2022), prediction competitions have proven fruitful in fostering methodological innovation, highlighting the collaborative spirit prevalent in the field. The plethora of contributions from international teams underscored the value of diverse perspectives and the need for new metrics to appreciate the advancements in predictive modeling of conflict.

Finally, Floros (2008) and Lessing (2012) represent endeavors to integrate demographic factors and the logic of cartel-state conflict into the predictive models, respectively, broadening the scope of tree-based algorithm applications.

In summary, the use of tree-based algorithms in modeling armed civil conflicts has demonstrated a marked evolution from preliminary methods to sophisticated, multi-model ensembles. The accumulated evidence points to their superiority over traditional statistical approaches, particularly in handling non-linearities, complex interactions, and high-dimensional data. While methodological challenges, such as balancing the trade-off between predictive power and model interpretability, persist, tree-based algorithms have proven themselves indispensable in seeking to understand and forecast the multifaceted phenomena of armed conflicts. Further research is expected to refine these models, expand their applicability, and continue the exploration of their predictive potential.
