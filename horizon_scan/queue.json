            "title": "Is There More Violence in the Middle?",
            "abstract": "Is there more violence in the middle? Over 100 studies have analyzed whether violent outcomes such as civil war, terrorism, and repression are more common in regimes that are neither full autocracies nor full democracies, yet findings are inconclusive. While this hypothesis is ultimately about functional form, existing work uses models in which a particular functional form is assumed. Existing work also uses arbitrary operationalizations of \u201cthe middle.\u201d This article aims to resolve the empirical uncertainty about this relationship by using a research design that overcomes the limitations of existing work. We use a random forest-like ensemble of multivariate regression and classification trees to predict multiple forms of conflict. Our results indicate the specific conditions under which there is or is not more violence in the middle. We find the most consistent support for the hypothesis with respect to minor civil conflict and no support with respect to repression. Replication Materials: The data, code, and any additional materials required to replicate all analyses in this article are available on the American Journal of Political Science Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network, at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LNUYXZ. What is the relationship between regime type and political violence? Are certain forms of conflict more likely in democracies or in autocracies? A series of influential studies has suggested this relationship is curvilinear, with violence most likely in regimes in the middle range\u2014often referred to as anocracies\u2014that are neither fully autocratic nor fully democratic (Eck and Hultman 2007; Fein 1995; Hegre et al. 2001). We refer to these arguments, collectively, as the More Violence in the Middle Hypothesis (or MVM Hypothesis). Despite decades of research, the extent to which such theories are empirically supported is unclear. While some early studies found that civil wars are most likely in anocracies (Hegre et al. 2001), others did not (Sambanis 2001). The debate may have appeared resolved when Vreeland (2008) showed that correcting for the extent to which measures of democracy might include indicators of violence results in no support for the MVM Hypothesis, but since then some have used his measure and found support for the hypothesis (Gleditsch and Ruggeri 2010), whereas others have confirmed his result (Peic and Reiter 2011). Likewise, some find evidence that terrorism is most Zachary M. Jones is Postdoctoral Fellow, eScience Institute, Campus Box 351570, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1570 (zmj@zmjones.com).

With respect to repression, Davenport and Armstrong (2004) arguably settled the question by using more appropriate methods for testing this hypothesis than the bulk of the literature and finding no support for the MVM Hypothesis, but some recent work continues to find support for it (Mitchell, Ring, and Spellman 2013). The purpose of this article is to reduce the empirical uncertainty about the MVM Hypothesis and describe the conditions under which it does or does not hold. Although existing work has made significant progress, the methods used to date have several consequential limitations. The MVM Hypothesis is a prediction about the functional form of the relationship between regime type and conflict, yet almost all existing tests of the MVM Hypothesis have been conducted using models that assume a particular functional form and then test whether the data allow us to reject a simpler possible relationship between regime type and conflict, such as a monotonic relationship. While such tools can allow us to reject a monotonic relationship, they are not well suited for understanding the more complex ways in which regime type American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 62, No. 3, July 2018, Pp. 652\u2013667 C \u00a92018, Midwest Political Science Association DOI: 10.1111/ajps.12373",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "title": "Predicting (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting: Does it work?",
            "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a prediction model of (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting. The prediction model builds on updated data from the PRIO-GRID data aggregator, contributing to the ViEWS prediction competition by predicting changes in violence levels, operationalized using monthly fatalities at the 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5-degree grid (pgm) level. Our model's predictive performance in terms of mean square error (MSE) is marginally worse than the ViEWS baseline model and inferior to most other submissions, including our own supervised random forest model. However, while we knew that the model was comparatively worse than our random forest model in terms of MSE, we propose the gradient boosting model because it performed better where it matters\u2014in predicting when (de-)escalation happens. This choice means that we question the usefulness of using MSE for evaluating model performance and instead propose alternative performance measurements that are needed to understand the usefulness of predictive models. We argue that future endeavors using this outcome should measure their performance using the Concordance Correlation, which takes both the trueness and the precision elements of accuracy into account, and, unlike MSE, seems to be robust to the issues caused by zero inflation. Este art\u00edculo presenta un modelo de predicci\u00f3n de la desescalada de la violencia subnacional mediante el uso de la potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente. El modelo de predicci\u00f3n se basa en los datos actualizados que provienen del agregador de datos de PRIO-GRID, contribuye al concurso de predicciones de ViEWS al predecir cambios en los niveles de violencia y es operacionalizado utilizando las muertes mensuales a nivel de cuadr\u00edcula de 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 grados (pgm). El rendimiento predictivo de nuestro modelo desde el punto de vista del error cuadr\u00e1tico medio (mean square error, MSE) es ligeramente peor que el modelo de referencia del sistema de alerta temprana sobre la violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) e inferior en relaci\u00f3n con la mayor\u00eda de las otras presentaciones, incluido nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio y supervisado. No obstante, si bien sab\u00edamos que el modelo era comparativamente peor que nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio en relaci\u00f3n con el MSE, proponemos el modelo de potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente porque funcion\u00f3 mejor en el aspecto que importa: predecir cu\u00e1ndo ocurre la desescalada. Esta elecci\u00f3n significa que cuestionamos la utilidad del uso del MSE para evaluar el rendimiento del modelo y, en cambio, proponemos mediciones de rendimiento alternativas que son necesarias para comprender la utilidad de los modelos predictivos. Sostenemos que, en los futuros proyectos en los que se utilice este resultado, se deber\u00eda medir el rendimiento mediante la correlaci\u00f3n de concordancia, la cual tiene en cuenta tanto los elementos de veracidad como los de precisi\u00f3n de la exactitud y, a diferencia del MSE, parece ser resistente a los problemas generados por la inflaci\u00f3n cero. Cet article pr\u00e9sente un mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction de la (d\u00e9s)escalade de la violence infranationale utilisant un boosting de gradient. Ce mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction repose sur des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 jour de l\u2019agr\u00e9gateur de donn\u00e9es de la grille PRIO. Il contribue au concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) en pr\u00e9disant les \u00e9volutions des niveaux de violence qui sont op\u00e9rationnalis\u00e9s sur la base du nombre mensuel de d\u00e9c\u00e8s au niveau 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 degr\u00e9 de la grille (PGM). Les performances pr\u00e9dictives de notre mod\u00e8le en termes d\u2019erreur quadratique moyenne (EQM) sont l\u00e9g\u00e8rement moins bonnes que celles du mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ViEWS et inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la plupart des autres mod\u00e8les soumis, y compris \u00e0 celles de notre propre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire supervis\u00e9e. Cependant, bien que nous sachions que ce mod\u00e8le \u00e0 boosting de gradient \u00e9tait comparativement moins bon que notre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire en termes d\u2019EQM, nous l\u2019avons propos\u00e9 car il \u00e9tait plus efficace dans le domaine qui compte : la pr\u00e9diction du moment auquel une (d\u00e9s)escalade interviendrait. Ce choix signifie que nous remettons en question l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019EQM pour \u00e9valuer les performances des mod\u00e8les et nous proposons au lieu de cela des mesures de performances alternatives n\u00e9cessaires pour comprendre l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9dictifs. Nous soutenons que les futurs efforts utilisant ce r\u00e9sultat devraient plut\u00f4t mesurer leurs performances \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la Corr\u00e9lation de concordance, qui prend \u00e0 la fois en compte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments Exactitude et Pr\u00e9cision et qui, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019EQM, semble \u00eatre robuste face aux probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l\u2019inflation z\u00e9ro.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The article examines the potential of multi-model ensemble learning techniques for conflict research and applies an ensemble averaging framework to the prediction task of the 2020 ViEWS armed conflict forecasting competition. The goal is to predict changes of conflict intensity in fifty-four African countries for 6 months into the future. The presented ensemble combines six individual models, using two tree-based learning algorithms, incorporating two distinct data foundations and two geographical selections into a unified forecasting framework. In one of the two applied datasets, the combination of conflict variables from recent months is implemented to train for inter-temporal connections of previous conflict levels. The second dataset contains important structural, economic, political, and social information relevant for each individual case. Both datasets are used to predict changes in conflict levels. The framework structure and the combination method are presented in detail, and the prediction results for both test periods between 2014\u20132016 and 2016\u20132019 are evaluated regarding their quality. The effect of the ensemble structure and the performance of all individual components is comprehensively examined. Real forecasts over the timespan of six months into the future are presented for the upcoming months of October 2020 through March 2021 generated from data available until August 2020. The paper concludes with the presentation and examination of three selected case forecasts for Egypt, Cameroon, and Mozambique. El art\u00edculo examina el potencial de las t\u00e9cnicas de aprendizaje de conjuntos multimodelos para la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos y aplica un marco de promedio de conjuntos a la tarea de predicci\u00f3n del concurso de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos armados; ViEWS 2020. La meta es predecir los cambios en la intensidad de los conflictos en cincuenta y cuatro pa\u00edses africanos durante seis meses en el futuro. El conjunto presentado combina seis modelos individuales, que utilizan dos algoritmos de aprendizaje basados en \u00e1rboles, y que incorporan dos bases de datos distintas y dos selecciones geogr\u00e1ficas en un marco de previsi\u00f3n unificado. En uno de los dos conjuntos de datos aplicados, se implementa la combinaci\u00f3n de variables de conflicto de los \u00faltimos meses para estudiar las conexiones intertemporales de los niveles de conflicto anteriores. El segundo conjunto de datos contiene informaci\u00f3n estructural, econ\u00f3mica, pol\u00edtica y social importante para cada caso individual. Ambos conjuntos de datos se utilizan para predecir los cambios en los niveles de conflicto. La estructura del marco y el m\u00e9todo de combinaci\u00f3n se presentan en detalle, y se eval\u00faa la calidad de los resultados de la predicci\u00f3n para ambos per\u00edodos de prueba entre 2014-2016 y 2016-2019. Se analiza a fondo el efecto de la estructura del conjunto y el funcionamiento de todos los componentes individuales. Se presentan previsiones reales a seis meses, para los pr\u00f3ximos meses de octubre de 2020 a marzo de 2021, generados a partir de los datos disponibles hasta agosto de 2020. El art\u00edculo concluye con la presentaci\u00f3n y el an\u00e1lisis de tres previsiones de casos seleccionados de Egipto, Camer\u00fan y Mozambique. Cet article examine le potentiel des techniques d\u2019apprentissage ensembliste multi-mod\u00e8les pour les recherches sur les conflits et applique un cadre de moyennage ensembliste \u00e0 la t\u00e2che de pr\u00e9diction du concours de pr\u00e9vision des conflits arm\u00e9s ViEWS (violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) 2020. L\u2019objectif est de pr\u00e9dire les changements d\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits dans cinquante-quatre pays africains sur les six mois \u00e0 venir. L\u2019ensemble pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 combine six mod\u00e8les individuels en utilisant deux algorithmes d\u2019apprentissage bas\u00e9s sur des arbres et en int\u00e9grant deux fondations de donn\u00e9es distinctes et deux s\u00e9lections g\u00e9ographiques \u00e0 une infrastructure de pr\u00e9vision unifi\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019un des deux jeux de donn\u00e9es appliqu\u00e9s, la combinaison des variables de conflit des derniers mois est impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e pour entra\u00eener les algorithmes sur les relations inter-temporelles des intensit\u00e9s de conflits pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Le deuxi\u00e8me jeu de donn\u00e9es contient d\u2019importantes informations structurelles, \u00e9conomiques, politiques et sociales concernant chacun des cas individuels. Les deux jeux de donn\u00e9es sont utilis\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9dire les changements d\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits. La structure de l\u2019infrastructure et la m\u00e9thode de combinaison sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en d\u00e9tails et la qualit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats des pr\u00e9dictions est \u00e9valu\u00e9e pour les deux p\u00e9riodes de test, 2014-2016 et 2016-2019. L\u2019effet de la structure ensembliste et les performances de toutes les composantes individuelles sont examin\u00e9s en profondeur. Les pr\u00e9visions r\u00e9elles sur une p\u00e9riode de six mois sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour les mois \u00e0 venir qui \u00e9taient octobre 2020 \u00e0 mars 2021. Ces pr\u00e9visions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es disponibles jusqu\u2019ao\u00fbt 2020. L\u2019article conclut par une pr\u00e9sentation et un examen d\u2019une s\u00e9lection de pr\u00e9visions pour trois cas, ceux de l\u2019\u00c9gypte, du Cameroun et du Mozambique.

            "title": "Predicting (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting: Does it work?",
            "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a prediction model of (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting. The prediction model builds on updated data from the PRIO-GRID data aggregator, contributing to the ViEWS prediction competition by predicting changes in violence levels, operationalized using monthly fatalities at the 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5-degree grid (pgm) level. Our model's predictive performance in terms of mean square error (MSE) is marginally worse than the ViEWS baseline model and inferior to most other submissions, including our own supervised random forest model. However, while we knew that the model was comparatively worse than our random forest model in terms of MSE, we propose the gradient boosting model because it performed better where it matters\u2014in predicting when (de-)escalation happens. This choice means that we question the usefulness of using MSE for evaluating model performance and instead propose alternative performance measurements that are needed to understand the usefulness of predictive models. We argue that future endeavors using this outcome should measure their performance using the Concordance Correlation, which takes both the trueness and the precision elements of accuracy into account, and, unlike MSE, seems to be robust to the issues caused by zero inflation. Este art\u00edculo presenta un modelo de predicci\u00f3n de la desescalada de la violencia subnacional mediante el uso de la potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente. El modelo de predicci\u00f3n se basa en los datos actualizados que provienen del agregador de datos de PRIO-GRID, contribuye al concurso de predicciones de ViEWS al predecir cambios en los niveles de violencia y es operacionalizado utilizando las muertes mensuales a nivel de cuadr\u00edcula de 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 grados (pgm). El rendimiento predictivo de nuestro modelo desde el punto de vista del error cuadr\u00e1tico medio (mean square error, MSE) es ligeramente peor que el modelo de referencia del sistema de alerta temprana sobre la violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) e inferior en relaci\u00f3n con la mayor\u00eda de las otras presentaciones, incluido nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio y supervisado. No obstante, si bien sab\u00edamos que el modelo era comparativamente peor que nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio en relaci\u00f3n con el MSE, proponemos el modelo de potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente porque funcion\u00f3 mejor en el aspecto que importa: predecir cu\u00e1ndo ocurre la desescalada. Esta elecci\u00f3n significa que cuestionamos la utilidad del uso del MSE para evaluar el rendimiento del modelo y, en cambio, proponemos mediciones de rendimiento alternativas que son necesarias para comprender la utilidad de los modelos predictivos. Sostenemos que, en los futuros proyectos en los que se utilice este resultado, se deber\u00eda medir el rendimiento mediante la correlaci\u00f3n de concordancia, la cual tiene en cuenta tanto los elementos de veracidad como los de precisi\u00f3n de la exactitud y, a diferencia del MSE, parece ser resistente a los problemas generados por la inflaci\u00f3n cero. Cet article pr\u00e9sente un mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction de la (d\u00e9s)escalade de la violence infranationale utilisant un boosting de gradient. Ce mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction repose sur des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 jour de l\u2019agr\u00e9gateur de donn\u00e9es de la grille PRIO. Il contribue au concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) en pr\u00e9disant les \u00e9volutions des niveaux de violence qui sont op\u00e9rationnalis\u00e9s sur la base du nombre mensuel de d\u00e9c\u00e8s au niveau 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 degr\u00e9 de la grille (PGM). Les performances pr\u00e9dictives de notre mod\u00e8le en termes d\u2019erreur quadratique moyenne (EQM) sont l\u00e9g\u00e8rement moins bonnes que celles du mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ViEWS et inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la plupart des autres mod\u00e8les soumis, y compris \u00e0 celles de notre propre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire supervis\u00e9e. Cependant, bien que nous sachions que ce mod\u00e8le \u00e0 boosting de gradient \u00e9tait comparativement moins bon que notre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire en termes d\u2019EQM, nous l\u2019avons propos\u00e9 car il \u00e9tait plus efficace dans le domaine qui compte : la pr\u00e9diction du moment auquel une (d\u00e9s)escalade interviendrait. Ce choix signifie que nous remettons en question l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019EQM pour \u00e9valuer les performances des mod\u00e8les et nous proposons au lieu de cela des mesures de performances alternatives n\u00e9cessaires pour comprendre l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9dictifs. Nous soutenons que les futurs efforts utilisant ce r\u00e9sultat devraient plut\u00f4t mesurer leurs performances \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la Corr\u00e9lation de concordance, qui prend \u00e0 la fois en compte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments Exactitude et Pr\u00e9cision et qui, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019EQM, semble \u00eatre robuste face aux probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l\u2019inflation z\u00e9ro.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The article examines the potential of multi-model ensemble learning techniques for conflict research and applies an ensemble averaging framework to the prediction task of the 2020 ViEWS armed conflict forecasting competition. The goal is to predict changes of conflict intensity in fifty-four African countries for 6 months into the future. The presented ensemble combines six individual models, using two tree-based learning algorithms, incorporating two distinct data foundations and two geographical selections into a unified forecasting framework. In one of the two applied datasets, the combination of conflict variables from recent months is implemented to train for inter-temporal connections of previous conflict levels. The second dataset contains important structural, economic, political, and social information relevant for each individual case. Both datasets are used to predict changes in conflict levels. The framework structure and the combination method are presented in detail, and the prediction results for both test periods between 2014\u20132016 and 2016\u20132019 are evaluated regarding their quality. The effect of the ensemble structure and the performance of all individual components is comprehensively examined. Real forecasts over the timespan of six months into the future are presented for the upcoming months of October 2020 through March 2021 generated from data available until August 2020. The paper concludes with the presentation and examination of three selected case forecasts for Egypt, Cameroon, and Mozambique. El art\u00edculo examina el potencial de las t\u00e9cnicas de aprendizaje de conjuntos multimodelos para la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos y aplica un marco de promedio de conjuntos a la tarea de predicci\u00f3n del concurso de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos armados; ViEWS 2020. La meta es predecir los cambios en la intensidad de los conflictos en cincuenta y cuatro pa\u00edses africanos durante seis meses en el futuro. El conjunto presentado combina seis modelos individuales, que utilizan dos algoritmos de aprendizaje basados en \u00e1rboles, y que incorporan dos bases de datos distintas y dos selecciones geogr\u00e1ficas en un marco de previsi\u00f3n unificado. En uno de los dos conjuntos de datos aplicados, se implementa la combinaci\u00f3n de variables de conflicto de los \u00faltimos meses para estudiar las conexiones intertemporales de los niveles de conflicto anteriores. El segundo conjunto de datos contiene informaci\u00f3n estructural, econ\u00f3mica, pol\u00edtica y social importante para cada caso individual. Ambos conjuntos de datos se utilizan para predecir los cambios en los niveles de conflicto. La estructura del marco y el m\u00e9todo de combinaci\u00f3n se presentan en detalle, y se eval\u00faa la calidad de los resultados de la predicci\u00f3n para ambos per\u00edodos de prueba entre 2014-2016 y 2016-2019. Se analiza a fondo el efecto de la estructura del conjunto y el funcionamiento de todos los componentes individuales. Se presentan previsiones reales a seis meses, para los pr\u00f3ximos meses de octubre de 2020 a marzo de 2021, generados a partir de los datos disponibles hasta agosto de 2020. El art\u00edculo concluye con la presentaci\u00f3n y el an\u00e1lisis de tres previsiones de casos seleccionados de Egipto, Camer\u00fan y Mozambique. Cet article examine le potentiel des techniques d\u2019apprentissage ensembliste multi-mod\u00e8les pour les recherches sur les conflits et applique un cadre de moyennage ensembliste \u00e0 la t\u00e2che de pr\u00e9diction du concours de pr\u00e9vision des conflits arm\u00e9s ViEWS (violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) 2020. L\u2019objectif est de pr\u00e9dire les changements d\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits dans cinquante-quatre pays africains sur les six mois \u00e0 venir. L\u2019ensemble pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 combine six mod\u00e8les individuels en utilisant deux algorithmes d\u2019apprentissage bas\u00e9s sur des arbres et en int\u00e9grant deux fondations de donn\u00e9es distinctes et deux s\u00e9lections g\u00e9ographiques \u00e0 une infrastructure de pr\u00e9vision unifi\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019un des deux jeux de donn\u00e9es appliqu\u00e9s, la combinaison des variables de conflit des derniers mois est impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e pour entra\u00eener les algorithmes sur les relations inter-temporelles des intensit\u00e9s de conflits pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Le deuxi\u00e8me jeu de donn\u00e9es contient d\u2019importantes informations structurelles, \u00e9conomiques, politiques et sociales concernant chacun des cas individuels. Les deux jeux de donn\u00e9es sont utilis\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9dire les changements d\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits. La structure de l\u2019infrastructure et la m\u00e9thode de combinaison sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en d\u00e9tails et la qualit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats des pr\u00e9dictions est \u00e9valu\u00e9e pour les deux p\u00e9riodes de test, 2014-2016 et 2016-2019. L\u2019effet de la structure ensembliste et les performances de toutes les composantes individuelles sont examin\u00e9s en profondeur. Les pr\u00e9visions r\u00e9elles sur une p\u00e9riode de six mois sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour les mois \u00e0 venir qui \u00e9taient octobre 2020 \u00e0 mars 2021. Ces pr\u00e9visions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es disponibles jusqu\u2019ao\u00fbt 2020. L\u2019article conclut par une pr\u00e9sentation et un examen d\u2019une s\u00e9lection de pr\u00e9visions pour trois cas, ceux de l\u2019\u00c9gypte, du Cameroun et du Mozambique.

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the performance of alternative prediction models for conflict. The analysis contrasts the performance of conventional approaches based on predicted probabilities generated by binary response regressions and random forests with two unconventional classification algorithms. The unconventional algorithms are calibrated specifically to minimize a prediction loss function penalizing Type 1 and Type 2 errors: (1) an algorithm that selects linear combinations of correlates of conflict to minimize the prediction loss function, and (2) an algorithm that chooses a set of thresholds for the same variables, together with the number of breaches of thresholds that constitute a prediction of conflict, that minimize the prediction loss function. The paper evaluates the predictive power of these approaches in a set of conflict and non-conflict episodes constructed from a large country-year panel of developing countries since 1977, and finds substantial differences in the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance of these alternative algorithms. The threshold classifier has the best overall predictive performance, and moreover has advantages in simplicity and transparency that make it well suited for policy-making purposes. The paper explores the implications of these findings for the World Bank's classification of fragile and conflict-affected states.",

            "title": "Population and Security: How Demographic Change Can Lead to Violent Conflict",
            "abstract": "\"While the marked decrease in population growth in many countries and regions is good news for those concerned about global population, it offers no clear relief for concerns about the security implications of population change.\" As we cross into the new century, the world seems finally to have turned the corner on population growth. A combination of increased education for women, national and international support for policies of population planning and the spread of economic development and accompanying movement along the demographic transition frontier have led to falling population growth rates around the world. Whether among the behemoths--China and India--or among the smaller but rapidly growing nations--such as Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Malawi--population growth rates have dropped dramatically in the last decade. (1) Yet while population growth rates have dropped around the world, they remain high in some areas. In particular, many nations in the Middle East, southeast Asia and central and northern Africa still are growing at nearly 3 percent per year, a growth rate that leads to a doubling of population in approximately 25 years. Moreover, although in most countries the rate of population growth has slowed, the absolute number of people being added to the world's population has not; the large number of women of childbearing age in the developing world, carrying the momentum of past population growth, ensure that even while growth rates fall as a percentage of the existing population, the number of new births each year continues to rise. For example, although China's growth rate has fallen to 1.0 percent per year, China will still grow by 10 to 11 million people per year for the next 15 years. The world as a whole will add roughly 80 million people per year, or another 960 million (that is, another India) in the next dozen years. (2) DEMOGRAPHY AND SECURITY: KEY FINDINGS After nearly three decades of debate and analysis, stemming from Myron Weiner's (1971) path-breaking study, scholars are beginning to develop much clearer answers to the complex questions regarding how population changes affect security concerns. Those answers can be summarized briefly in the following propositions, each of which we shall treat in greater detail below: 1) While population growth often brings degradation of forests, water resources, arable land and other local resources, such environmental degradation is not a major or pervasive cause of international wars, ethnic wars or revolutionary conflicts. Such degradation often brings misery, yet such misery does not generally trigger the elite alienation and opposition to the government necessary for large-scale violence to occur. 2) Population growth can give rise to conflicts over increasingly scarce resources, such as farmland, if those conflicts involve elites seeking to take resources from popular groups, or competition between elite factions for control of those resources. However, what determines whether violent conflict arises are the relationships among popular groups, elites and the state, and particularly whether the state has the capacity to channel and moderate elite conflicts. Only where elite conflicts or popular resistance to elite actions overwhelm weak states do major conflicts arise. 3) While overall population growth and population density do not generally predict political risks, a number of distinct kinds of demographic changes--rapid growth in the labor force in slow-growing economies, a rapid increase in educated youth aspiring to elite positions when such positions are scarce, unequal population growth rates between different ethnic groups, urbanization that exceeds employment growth and migrations that change the local balance among major ethnic groups--do appear to increase the risks of violent internal political and ethnic conflicts. In addition, there is some evidence that countries with larger populations have greater risks of both armed conflict and state repression. \u2026",

            "title": "Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data",
            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "We argue that commitment problems in the construction of power-sharing arrangements tend to make civil con icts \u0093all or nothing\u0094 ghts for control of central or regional government. An implication is that civil wars will tend to end with military victory occasioned by a shock to one side's relative power or cost tolerance. We code the 119 terminated civil con icts listed by the Political Instability Task Force using a new scheme that recognizes conceptual differences in the meaning of military victory and negotiated settlements for civil wars where the rebel groups seek power at the center versus in a region. We nd that power-sharing is quite rare in center-seeking wars, and somewhat more common in separatist con icts (in the form of regional autonomy agreements). Finally, we examine case narratives for 30 randomly selected con icts. We nd that shocks to relative power in the form of entry or exit of foreign support for one side commonly caused civil war termination. We also nd some evidence that changes in government leadership, possibly the result of shocks to cost tolerance, associates with civil war termination in our set of \u0093random narratives.\u0094",

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "\n We aimed to demonstrate how a large collection of publicly accessible Australian Coroner\u2019s Court case files (n=4459) (2009-2019) can be automatically classified for determination of death by suicide, presence of mental health disorder and sex of deceased via Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods - supervised machine learning and unsupervised dictionary-based and string search based approaches. We achieved superior levels of accuracy in the machine learning classification (Gradient Boosting vs. Random Forest baseline) of deaths by suicide of 83.3% (sensitivity = 85.1%, Specificity = 79.1%) and an accuracy of 98.3% for the dictionary-based classification of mental health disorder, as defined by the OCD-10 (sensitivity = 99.0%, specificity = 97.9%). Our machine learning approach automatically classified 24.2% (1078/4459) of the case files as referring to deaths by suicide while 63.7% (2940/4459) where classified as exhibiting a mental health disorder1. We employed a two-stage machine learning approach involving feature engineering, followed by predictive modelling in the second. Feature engineering involved several steps including removal of low value text, parts of speech analysis, term document weighting and topic clustering. Predictive classification involved extensive hyperparameter tuning to yield the most accurate model. We validated our models against a manually pre-coded subsample of case files, and also via binary logistic regression to test the contribution of each classified mental health disorder against determinations of deaths by suicide according to extant literature. This validation step confirmed elevated odds of suicide attributed to diagnoses of Depression, Schizophrenia and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Finally, we offer a short case study to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in investigating a subset of case findings referring to suicides resulting from family violence. We offer a proof of concept model that demonstrates an objective and scalable approach to the analysis of legal texts. The use of NLP methods in analysing Coroner's Court case findings has important implications for the ongoing development of a real-time surveillance of suicide system in Australia.",
