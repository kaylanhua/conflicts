            "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered frequent outbreaks of armed conflict since the end of the Cold War. Although several efforts have been made to understand the underlying causes of armed conflict and establish an early warning mechanism, there is still a lack of a comprehensive assessment approach to model the incidence risk of armed conflict well. Based on a large database of armed conflict events and related spatial datasets covering the period 2000\u20132019, this study uses a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach to model the spatiotemporal distribution of armed conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of accuracy indicates that the simulated models obtain high performance with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) mean value of 0.937 and an area under the precision recall curves (PR-AUC) mean value of 0.891. The result of the relative contribution indicates that the background context factors (i.e., social welfare and the political system) are the main driving factors of armed conflict risk, with a mean relative contribution of 92.599%. By comparison, the climate change-related variables have relatively little effect on armed conflict risk, accounting for only 7.401% of the total. These results provide novel insight into modelling the incidence risk of armed conflict, which may help implement interventions to prevent and minimize the harm of armed conflict.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Recent research on the forecasting of violence has mostly focused on predicting the presence or absence of conflict in a given location, while much less attention has been paid to predicting changes in violence. We organized a prediction competition to forecast changes in state-based violence both for the true future and for a test partition. We received contributions from 15 international teams. The models leverage new insight on the targeted problem, insisting on methodological advances, new data and features, and innovative frameworks which contribute to the research frontiers from various perspectives. This article introduces the competition, presents the main innovations fostered by the teams and discusses ways to further expand and improve upon this wisdom of the crowd. We show that an optimal modeling approach builds on a good number of the presented contributions and new evaluation metrics are needed to capture substantial models\u2019 improvements and reward unique insights. La investigaci\u00f3n reciente sobre la previsi\u00f3n de la violencia se ha centrado principalmente en predecir la presencia o ausencia de conflictos en un determinado lugar, mientras que se ha prestado mucha menos atenci\u00f3n a predecir los cambios en la violencia. Organizamos una competencia de predicci\u00f3n para predecir los cambios en la violencia estatal tanto para el futuro cierto como para una divisi\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis. Recibimos aportes de quince equipos internacionales. Los modelos aprovechan las nuevas ideas sobre el problema espec\u00edfico insistiendo en los avances metodol\u00f3gicos, los nuevos datos y caracter\u00edsticas, as\u00ed como en los marcos innovadores que contribuyen a las fronteras de la investigaci\u00f3n desde diversas perspectivas. Este art\u00edculo presenta la competencia y las principales innovaciones que los equipos fomentan, y analiza maneras de expandirse y mejorar a\u00fan m\u00e1s a partir de esta sabidur\u00eda del p\u00fablico. Mostramos que un enfoque de modelaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptimo se crea a partir de un buen n\u00famero de aportes presentados y que se necesitan nuevas m\u00e9tricas de evaluaci\u00f3n para capturar las mejoras considerables de los modelos y para premiar las ideas \u00fanicas. Les recherches r\u00e9centes sur la pr\u00e9vision de la violence se sont principalement concentr\u00e9es sur la pr\u00e9diction de la pr\u00e9sence ou de l\u2019absence de conflit dans un lieu donn\u00e9, alors que beaucoup moins d\u2019attention a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9diction des \u00e9volutions de la violence.

            "title": "Projecting armed conflict risk in Africa towards 2050 along the SSP-RCP scenarios: a machine learning approach",
            "abstract": "In the past decade, several efforts have been made to project armed conflict risk into the future. This study broadens current approaches by presenting a first-of-its-kind application of machine learning (ML) methods to project sub-national armed conflict risk over the African continent along three Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and three Representative Concentration Pathways towards 2050. Results of the open-source ML framework CoPro are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic storylines of the SSPs, and the resulting out-of-sample armed conflict projections obtained with Random Forest classifiers agree with the patterns observed in comparable studies. In SSP1-RCP2.6, conflict risk is low in most regions although the Horn of Africa and parts of East Africa continue to be conflict-prone. Conflict risk increases in the more adverse SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario, especially in Central Africa and large parts of Western Africa. We specifically assessed the role of hydro-climatic indicators as drivers of armed conflict. Overall, their importance is limited compared to main conflict predictors but results suggest that changing climatic conditions may both increase and decrease conflict risk, depending on the location: in Northern Africa and large parts of Eastern Africa climate change increases projected conflict risk whereas for areas in the West and northern part of the Sahel shifting climatic conditions may reduce conflict risk. With our study being at the forefront of ML applications for conflict risk projections, we identify various challenges for this arising scientific field. A major concern is the limited selection of relevant quantified indicators for the SSPs at present. Nevertheless, ML models such as the one presented here are a viable and scalable way forward in the field of armed conflict risk projections, and can help to inform the policy-making process with respect to climate security.",

Our improved evaluation procedures allow us to develop models that specialize in either the immediate or the more distant future. We also present a formal, \u2018retrospective\u2019 evaluation of how well ViEWS has done since we started publishing our forecasts from July 2018 up to December 2019. Our metrics show that ViEWS is performing well when compared to previous out-of-sample forecasts for the 2015\u201317 period. Finally, we present our new forecasts for the January 2020\u2013December 2022 period. We continue to predict a near-constant situation of conflict in Nigeria, Somalia, and DRC, but see some signs of decreased risk in Cameroon and Mozambique.",

            "abstract": "There is an active debate regarding the influence that climate has on the risk of armed conflict, which stems from challenges in assembling unbiased datasets, competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of climate influence, and the difficulty of disentangling direct and indirect climate effects. We use gridded historical non-state conflict records, satellite data, and land surface models in a structural equation modeling approach to uncover the direct and indirect effects of climate on violent conflicts in Africa and the Middle East (ME). We show that climate\u2013conflict linkages in these regions are more complex than previously suggested, with multiple mechanisms at work. Warm temperatures and low rainfall direct effects on conflict risk were stronger than indirect effects through food and water supplies. Warming increases the risk of violence in Africa but unexpectedly decreases this risk in the ME. Furthermore, at the country level, warming decreases the risk of violence in most West African countries. Overall, we find a non-linear response of conflict to warming across countries that depends on the local temperature conditions. We further show that magnitude and sign of the effects largely depend on the scale of analysis and geographical context. These results imply that extreme caution should be exerted when attempting to explain or project local climate\u2013conflict relationships based on a single, generalized theory.",

            "abstract": "This article presents ViEWS \u2013 a political violence early-warning system that seeks to be maximally transparent, publicly available, and have uniform coverage, and sketches the methodological innovations required to achieve these objectives. ViEWS produces monthly forecasts at the country and subnational level for 36 months into the future and all three UCDP types of organized violence: state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided violence in Africa. The article presents the methodology and data behind these forecasts, evaluates their predictive performance, provides selected forecasts for October 2018 through October 2021, and indicates future extensions. ViEWS is built as an ensemble of constituent models designed to optimize its predictions. Each of these represents a theme that the conflict research literature suggests is relevant, or implements a specific statistical/machine-learning approach. Current forecasts indicate a persistence of conflict in regions in Africa with a recent history of political violence but also alert to new conflicts such as in Southern Cameroon and Northern Mozambique. The subsequent evaluation additionally shows that ViEWS is able to accurately capture the long-term behavior of established political violence, as well as diffusion processes such as the spread of violence in Cameroon. The performance demonstrated here indicates that ViEWS can be a useful complement to non-public conflict-warning systems, and also serves as a reference against which future improvements can be evaluated.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the performance of alternative prediction models for conflict. The analysis contrasts the performance of conventional approaches based on predicted probabilities generated by binary response regressions and random forests with two unconventional classification algorithms. The unconventional algorithms are calibrated specifically to minimize a prediction loss function penalizing Type 1 and Type 2 errors: (1) an algorithm that selects linear combinations of correlates of conflict to minimize the prediction loss function, and (2) an algorithm that chooses a set of thresholds for the same variables, together with the number of breaches of thresholds that constitute a prediction of conflict, that minimize the prediction loss function. The paper evaluates the predictive power of these approaches in a set of conflict and non-conflict episodes constructed from a large country-year panel of developing countries since 1977, and finds substantial differences in the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance of these alternative algorithms. The threshold classifier has the best overall predictive performance, and moreover has advantages in simplicity and transparency that make it well suited for policy-making purposes. The paper explores the implications of these findings for the World Bank's classification of fragile and conflict-affected states.",

            "abstract": "We examine if dynamic information from event data can help improve on a model attempting to forecast civil war using measures reflecting plausible motivation and grievances. Buhaug, Cederman, and Gleditsch predict the risk of civil war using a horizontal inequality model with measures reflecting motivation and relevant group characteristics at the country level. The predictions from their model outperform in an out-of-sample forecast conventional country-level models of civil war, emphasizing vertical inequality and country characteristics. However, most grievance measures change little over time. We surmise that a model reflecting potential motivation for conflict can be improved with more dynamic information on mobilization and the behavior of actors. Our conjecture receives some support in the empirical analysis, where we consider both conflict onset and termination over territorial and governmental incompatibilities in the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Data, and find some evidence that event data can help improve forecasts. Moreover, models with the original grievance measures do better than purely event based models, supporting our claim that both structure and event based components can add value to conflict prediction models. However, the contribution of events to improving predictive power is modest and not entirely consistent, and some types of conflict events seem easier to forecast than others.",

            "title": "Civil conflict sensitivity to growing-season drought",
            "abstract": "Significance Understanding the conflict potential of drought is critical for dealing effectively with the societal implications of climate change. Using new georeferenced ethnicity and conflict data for Asia and Africa since 1989, we present an actor-oriented analysis of growing-season drought and conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Results from naive models common in previous research suggest that drought generally has little impact. However, context-sensitive models accounting for the groups\u2019 level of vulnerability reveal that drought can contribute to sustaining conflict, especially for agriculturally dependent groups and politically excluded groups in very poor countries. These results suggest a reciprocal nature\u2013society interaction in which violent conflict and environmental shock constitute a vicious circle, each phenomenon increasing the group\u2019s vulnerability to the other. To date, the research community has failed to reach a consensus on the nature and significance of the relationship between climate variability and armed conflict. We argue that progress has been hampered by insufficient attention paid to the context in which droughts and other climatic extremes may increase the risk of violent mobilization. Addressing this shortcoming, this study presents an actor-oriented analysis of the drought\u2013conflict relationship, focusing specifically on politically relevant ethnic groups and their sensitivity to growing-season drought under various political and socioeconomic contexts. To this end, we draw on new conflict event data that cover Asia and Africa, 1989\u20132014, updated spatial ethnic settlement data, and remote sensing data on agricultural land use. Our procedure allows quantifying, for each ethnic group, drought conditions during the growing season of the locally dominant crop. A comprehensive set of multilevel mixed effects models that account for the groups\u2019 livelihood, economic, and political vulnerabilities reveals that a drought under most conditions has little effect on the short-term risk that a group challenges the state by military means. However, for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries, a local drought is found to increase the likelihood of sustained violence. We interpret this as evidence of the reciprocal relationship between drought and conflict, whereby each phenomenon makes a group more vulnerable to the other.",

            "abstract": "Much of the recent research on civil war treats explanations rooted in political and economic grievances with considerable suspicion and claims that there is little empirical evidence of any relationship between ethnicity or inequality and political violence. We argue that common indicators used in previous research, such as the ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF) and the Gini coefficient for income dispersion, fail to capture fundamental aspects of political exclusion and economic inequality that can motivate conflict. Drawing on insights from group-level research, we develop new country-level indices that directly reflect inequalities among ethnic groups, including political discrimination and wealth differentials along ethnic lines. Our analysis reveals that these theoretically informed country profiles are much better predictors of civil war onset than conventional inequality indicators, even when we control for a number of alternative factors potentially related to grievances or opportunities for conflict.",

            "title": "Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Conflict",
            "abstract": "Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question. Climate and conflict across spatial scales. Evidence that temperature influences the risk of modern human conflict: (A) local violence in 1\u00b0 grid cells, (B) civil war in countries, and (C) civil conflict risk in the tropics. The map depicts regions of analysis corresponding to nonparametric watercolor regressions in (A) to (C). The color intensity in (A) to (C) indicates the level of certainty in the regression line. Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or \u201cnatural experiments\u201d; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions. Results Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate\u2019s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant (P < 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates). Discussion We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades\u2014with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050\u2014amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries. Climate and Conflict Knowledge silos can hinder attempts to explore questions of interest across many disciplines. Hsiang et al. (p. 1235367, published online 1 August) provide a meta-analysis of data from disciplines as disparate as archaeology and psychology to examine the relation between climate and conflict. Overall, warmer temperatures or extremes of rainfall can be causally associated with changes in interpersonal violence and in civil war. Across disciplinary boundaries, recently published evidence links climate change to increased violent conflict. A rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate\u2019s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1\u03c3) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2\u03c3 to 4\u03c3 by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.",

            "abstract": "The article predicts changes in global and regional incidences of armed conflict for the 2010\u20132050 period. The predictions are based on a dynamic multinomial logit model estimation on a 1970\u20132009 cross-sectional data set of changes between no armed conflict, minor conflict, and major conflict. Core exogenous predictors are population size, infant mortality rates, demographic composition, education levels, oil dependence, ethnic cleavages, and neighborhood characteristics. Predictions are obtained through simulating the behavior of the conflict variable implied by the estimates from this model. We use projections for the 2011\u20132050 period for the predictors from the UN World Population Prospects and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. We treat conflicts, recent conflict history, and neighboring conflicts as endogenous variables. Out-of-sample validation of predictions for 2007\u20132009 (based on estimates for the 1970\u20132000 period) indicates that the model predicts well, with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.937. Using a p > .30 threshold for positive prediction, the true positive rate 7\u20139 years into the future is 0.79 and the False Positive Rate 0.085. We predict a continued decline in the proportion of the world's countries that have internal armed conflict, from about 15% in 2009 to 7% in 2050. The decline is particularly strong in the Western Asia and North Africa region and less clear in Africa south of Sahara. The remaining conflict countries will increasingly be concentrated in East, Central, and Southern Africa and in East and South Asia.",

We consider the effects of climate change to be both local and national in character, and we use a conflict database that contains 16,359 individual geolocated violent events for East Africa from 1990 to 2009. Unlike previous studies that relied exclusively on political and economic controls, we analyze the many geographical factors that have been shown to be important in understanding the distribution and causes of violence while also considering yearly and country fixed effects. For our main climate indicators at gridded 1\u00b0 resolution (\u223c100 km), wetter deviations from the precipitation norms decrease the risk of violence, whereas drier and normal periods show no effects. The relationship between temperature and conflict shows that much warmer than normal temperatures raise the risk of violence, whereas average and cooler temperatures have no effect. These precipitation and temperature effects are statistically significant but have modest influence in terms of predictive power in a model with political, economic, and physical geographic predictors. Large variations in the climate\u2013conflict relationships are evident between the nine countries of the study region and across time periods.",

From an initial examination of communal conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa, the risk of conflict depends largely on the size and political importance of ethnic groups. Environmental issues can be catalysts to low-level conflict in marginalized communities, but the critical factor is the extent of political and economic marginalization. Small, politically insignificant ethnic groups experience most conflicts related to environmental pressures. This framework informs a prediction of where we should expect to see high levels of politically induced vulnerability and resultant intra- and intercommunal conflicts.",

Intriguingly, the model uses few variables and a simple specification. The model is accurate in forecasting the onsets of both violent civil wars and nonviolent democratic reversals, suggesting common factors in both types of change. Whereas regime type is typically measured using linear or binary indicators of democracy/autocracy derived from the 21-point Polity scale, the model uses a nonlinear five-category measure of regime type based on the Polity components. This new measure of regime type emerges as the most powerful predictor of instability onsets, leading us to conclude that political institutions, properly specified, and not economic conditions, demography, or geography, are the most important predictors of the onset of political instability.",

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.",

            "abstract": "This article explores empirically the duration of civil war. It relates the duration of civil war to two alternative models of conflict and culls testable hypotheses from the case study literature on civil war. Using a comprehensive dataset on large-scale violent civil conflicts covering the 1960-2000 period, a wide range of hypotheses are tested by means of hazard function regressions. The results show that the duration of conflict is systematically related both to structural conditions prevailing prior to conflict and to circumstances during conflict. The key structural characteristics that lengthen conflict are low per capita income, high inequality and a moderate degree of ethnic division. The key variable characteristics that shorten conflict are a decline in the prices of the primary commodities that the country exports and external military intervention on the side of the rebels. Furthermore, the results indicate that the chances of peace were much lower in the 1980s and 1990s than they had been previously. Three empirical explanations are suggested as different approaches to civil war: rebellion-as-investment, in which the critical incentive is the post-conflict payoff; rebellion-as-business, in which the critical incentive is the payoff during conflict; and rebellion-as-mistake, in which military optimism prevents the recognition of any mutually advantageous settlement. The article concludes that the empirical evidence is incompatible with the first of these approaches but consistent with the others.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We provide a proof-of-concept for a novel state-space modelling approach for predicting monthly deaths due to political violence. Attention is focused on developing the method and demonstrating the utility of this approach, which provides exciting opportunities to engage with domain experts in developing new and improved state-space models for predicting violence. The prediction is made on a grid of cells with spatial resolution of 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 degrees, and each cell is modeled to have two mathematically well-defined unobserved/latent/hidden states that evolves over time and encode the \u201conset risk\u201d and \u201cpotential severity\u201d, respectively. This offers a certain level of interpretability of the model. By using the model for computing the probability distribution for a death count at a future time conditioned on all data observed up until the current time, a predictive distribution is obtained. The predictive distribution typically places a certain mass at the death count 0 (no violent outbreak) and the remaining mass indicating a likely interval of the fatality count, should a violent outbreak appear. To evaluate the model performance we\u2014lacking a better alternative\u2014report the mean of the predictive distribution, but the access to the predictive distribution is in itself an interesting contribution to the application. This work merely serves as a proof-of-concept for the state-space modeling approach for this type of data and several possible directions for further work that could improve the predictive performance are suggested.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article illustrates an approach to forecasting change in conflict fatalities designed to address the complexity of the drivers and processes of armed conflicts. The design of this approach is based on two main choices. First, to account for the specificity of conflict drivers and processes over time and space, we model conflicts in each individual country separately. Second, we draw on an adaptive model\u2014Dynamic Elastic Net, DynENet\u2014which is able to efficiently select relevant predictors among a large set of covariates. We include over 700 variables in our models, adding event data on top of the data features provided by the convenors of the forecasting competition. We show that our approach is suitable and computationally efficient enough to address the complexity of conflict dynamics. Moreover, the adaptive nature of our model brings a significant added value. Because for each country our model only selects the variables that are relevant to predict conflict intensity, the retained predictors can be analyzed to describe the dynamic configuration of conflict drivers both across countries and within countries over time. Countries can then be clustered to observe the emergence of broader patterns related to correlates of conflict. In this sense, our approach produces interpretable forecasts, addressing one key limitation of contemporary approaches to forecasting.",

            "title": "Click, click boom: Using Wikipedia data to predict changes in battle-related deaths",
            "abstract": "Abstract Data and methods development are key to improve our ability to forecast conflict. Relatively recent data sources such as mobile phone and social media data or images have received widespread attention in conflict research. Oftentimes these do not cover substantial parts of the globe or they are difficult to obtain and manipulate, which makes regular updating challenging. The sometimes vast amounts of data can also be computationally and financially costly. The data source we propose instead is cheap, readily and openly available, and updated in real time, and it provides global coverage: Wikipedia. We argue that the number of country page views can be considered a measure of interest or salience, whereas the number of page changes can be considered a measure of controversy between competing political views. We expect these predictors to be particularly successful in capturing tensions before a conflict escalates. We test our argument by predicting changes in battle-related deaths in Africa on the country-month level. We find evidence that country page views do increase predictive performance while page changes do not. Contrary to our expectation, our model seems to capture long-term trends better than sharp short-term changes. El desarrollo de datos y m\u00e9todos es fundamental para perfeccionar nuestra habilidad de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos. Las fuentes de datos relativamente nuevas, tales como los datos o las im\u00e1genes de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares y de las redes sociales, han recibido una atenci\u00f3n generalizada en la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos. A menudo, dichas fuentes no cubren las partes primordiales del mundo o son dif\u00edciles de obtener y manejar, lo que hace que la actualizaci\u00f3n peri\u00f3dica sea un desaf\u00edo. Las cantidades de datos, en ocasiones enormes, tambi\u00e9n pueden ser costosas desde el punto de vista inform\u00e1tico y financiero. En su lugar, la fuente de datos que proponemos es econ\u00f3mica, est\u00e1 disponible f\u00e1cil y p\u00fablicamente, se actualiza en tiempo real y proporciona una cobertura global: Wikipedia. Planteamos que la cantidad de p\u00e1ginas vistas por pa\u00eds puede considerarse una medida de inter\u00e9s o prominencia, mientras que el n\u00famero de cambios de p\u00e1gina puede considerarse una medida de controversia entre las opiniones pol\u00edticas rivales. Esperamos que estos indicadores tengan especial \u00e9xito a la hora de captar las tensiones antes de que el conflicto se intensifique. Ponemos a prueba nuestro argumento prediciendo cambios en las muertes relacionadas con las batallas en \u00c1frica a nivel mensual y por pa\u00eds. Encontramos pruebas de que esas p\u00e1ginas vistas por pa\u00eds aumentan el rendimiento predictivo, mientras que los cambios de p\u00e1gina no lo hacen. Al contrario de lo que esper\u00e1bamos, nuestro modelo parece registrar mejor las tendencias a largo plazo que los cambios bruscos a corto plazo. Les donn\u00e9es et le d\u00e9veloppement des m\u00e9thodes sont essentiels \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de notre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir les conflits. La recherche sur les conflits a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 avec application des sources de donn\u00e9es relativement r\u00e9centes, telles que celles fournies par les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones portables ou les m\u00e9dias sociaux. N\u00e9anmoins, dans de nombreux cas, les donn\u00e9es obtenues n\u2019englobent pas l\u2019ensemble de la plan\u00e8te. Elles sont parfois difficiles \u00e0 obtenir et sont d\u00e9licates \u00e0 manipuler, ce qui rend difficile toute mise \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. En outre, du fait de leur quantit\u00e9, l\u2019analyse de ces donn\u00e9es peut \u00eatre chronophage et co\u00fbteuse. Au contraire, la source de donn\u00e9es que nous proposons est bon march\u00e9, publique et imm\u00e9diatement disponible, mise \u00e0 jour en temps r\u00e9el, et inclut l\u2019ensemble de la plan\u00e8te : Wikip\u00e9dia. Nous soutenons que le nombre de pages vues par pays permet de mesurer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou l\u2019importance d\u2019un sujet, tandis que le nombre de changements apport\u00e9s aux pages permet de mesurer le niveau de controverses entre des opinions politiques concurrentes. Nous estimons que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments permettent d\u2019identifier avec succ\u00e8s des tensions avant qu\u2019un conflit n\u2019\u00e9clate. Nous v\u00e9rifions la justesse de nos hypoth\u00e8ses en pr\u00e9disant des changements en ce qui concerne le nombre de victimes dans des combats en Afrique, par pays et par mois. Nous apportons la preuve que le nombre de pages vues par pays a une valeur pr\u00e9dictive, mais que le nombre de changements apport\u00e9s aux pages n\u2019en a pas. Contrairement \u00e0 nos attentes, notre mod\u00e8le semble permettre d\u2019identifier des tendances de long terme, et non des changements soudains de court terme.",

            "abstract": "Abstract One way of improving forecasts is through better data. We explore how much we can improve predictions of conflict violence by introducing data reflecting third-party efforts to manage violence. By leveraging new sub-national data on all UN peacekeeping deployments in Africa, 1994\u20132020, from the Geocoded Peacekeeping (Geo-PKO) dataset, we predict changes in violence at the local level. The advantage of data on peacekeeping deployments is that these vary over time and space, as opposed to many structural variables commonly used. We present two peacekeeping models that contain several local peacekeeping features, each with a separate set of additional variables that form the respective benchmark. The mean errors of our predictions only improve marginally. However, comparing observed and predicted changes in violence, the peacekeeping features improve our ability to identify the correct sign of the change. These results are particularly strong when we limit the sample to countries that have seen peacekeeping deployments. For an ambitious forecasting project, like ViEWS, it may thus be highly relevant to incorporate fine-grained and frequently updated data on peacekeeping troops.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article addresses the discrepancy between the explanation and the prediction of political violence through the development of different models that approximate the decision-making on war and peace. Borrowing from the crisis bargaining literature, the prediction models particularly consider the situational attributes through which players can challenge the status quo. We distinguish between direct and indirect proxies of a weakening of the status quo and show that adding decision-making data can improve the accuracy of cross-sectional forecasting models. The study, which demonstrates the increased conflict risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thus another development upsetting the status quo, discusses the usefulness of decision-making forecasts through various case study illustrations. Este art\u00edculo aborda la discrepancia entre la explicaci\u00f3n y la predicci\u00f3n de la violencia pol\u00edtica mediante la elaboraci\u00f3n de diversos modelos que se acercan a la toma de decisiones sobre la guerra y la paz. Inspirados en las publicaciones sobre negociaciones de crisis, los modelos de predicci\u00f3n consideran, en particular, las caracter\u00edsticas situacionales a trav\u00e9s de las cuales las piezas claves pueden desafiar el statu quo. Distinguimos entre indicadores directos e indirectos de un debilitamiento del statu quo y demostramos que la incorporaci\u00f3n de datos sobre la toma de decisiones puede mejorar la precisi\u00f3n de los modelos de previsi\u00f3n transversal. El estudio, que demuestra el aumento del riesgo de conflicto durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 y, por lo tanto, otro acontecimiento que altera el statu quo, analiza la utilidad de las previsiones para la toma de decisiones mediante diferentes ejemplos de casos pr\u00e1cticos.

            "abstract": "Abstract This contribution to the ViEWS prediction competition 2020 proposes using Markov modeling to model the change in the logarithm of battle-related deaths between two points in time in a country. The predictions are made using two ensembles of observed and hidden Markov models, where the covariate sets for the ensembles are drawn from the ViEWS country month constituent models. The weights for the individual models in the ensembles were obtained using a genetic algorithm optimizing the fit on the TADDA-score in a calibration set. The weighted ensembles of visible and hidden Markov models outperform the ViEWS prediction competition benchmark models on the TADDA score in the test period of January 2017 to December 2019 for all time steps. Forecasts until March 2021 predict increased violence primarily in Algeria, Libya, Tchad, Niger, and Angola, and decreased or unchanged levels of violence in most of the remaining countries in Africa. An analysis of the model weights in the ensembles shows that the conflict history constituent model provided by ViEWS was dominant in the ensembles. Esta contribuci\u00f3n a la competencia de predicciones 2020 del Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) propone utilizar la modelizaci\u00f3n de M\u00e1rkov para elaborar un modelo del cambio en el logaritmo de las muertes relacionadas con batallas entre dos puntos temporales en un pa\u00eds. Las predicciones se elaboran con dos conjuntos de modelos observados y ocultos de M\u00e1rkov, en los que los grupos de covariables de los conjuntos se obtienen de los modelos constituyentes mensuales de los pa\u00edses del ViEWS. La relevancia de los modelos individuales en los conjuntos se obtuvo mediante un algoritmo gen\u00e9tico que optimiza el ajuste de la puntuaci\u00f3n TADDA en un grupo de calibraci\u00f3n. Los conjuntos ponderados de los modelos visibles y ocultos de M\u00e1rkov superan los modelos de referencia de la competencia de predicciones del ViEWS en relaci\u00f3n con la puntuaci\u00f3n TADDA (Distancia absoluta orientada con aumento de direcci\u00f3n) en el per\u00edodo de prueba de enero de 2017 a diciembre de 2019 para todos los intervalos de tiempo. Las predicciones hasta marzo de 2021 pronostican un aumento en la violencia principalmente en Argelia, Libia, Chad, N\u00edger y Angola, y niveles de violencia disminuidos o sin variaciones en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses restantes en \u00c1frica. Un an\u00e1lisis de la relevancia de los modelos en los conjuntos demuestra que los modelos constituyentes de la historia de conflictos que proporciona el ViEWS fueron dominantes en dichos conjuntos. Cette contribution au concours de pr\u00e9vision ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) 2020 propose d\u2019utiliser la mod\u00e9lisation de Markov pour mod\u00e9liser l\u2019\u00e9volution du logarithme des d\u00e9c\u00e8s li\u00e9s aux conflits entre deux moments de l\u2019histoire d\u2019un pays. Les pr\u00e9dictions sont effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019aide de deux ensembles de mod\u00e8les de Markov cach\u00e9s et de mod\u00e8les de Markov observ\u00e9s, et les jeux de covariables de ces ensembles sont tir\u00e9s des mod\u00e8les constituants par mois et pays du syst\u00e8me ViEWS. Les pond\u00e9rations des mod\u00e8les individuels des ensembles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues en utilisant un algorithme g\u00e9n\u00e9tique optimisant l\u2019ajustement sur le score TADDA (Distance absolue cibl\u00e9e avec augmentation de direction) dans un jeu de calibration. Les ensembles pond\u00e9r\u00e9s de mod\u00e8les de Markov visibles et cach\u00e9s sont plus performants que les mod\u00e8les de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS pour ce qui est du score TADDA de la p\u00e9riode de test de janvier 2017 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2019, et ce pour tous les pas de temps. Les pr\u00e9visions jusqu\u2019\u00e0 mars 2021 ont permis de pr\u00e9dire une augmentation de la violence principalement en Alg\u00e9rie, en Libye, au Tchad, au Niger et en Angola, et une diminution ou un maintien des niveaux de violence dans la plupart des autres pays d\u2019Afrique.

            "abstract": "Abstract The 2020 Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) Prediction Competition challenged participants to produce predictive models of violent political conflict at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper presents a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network capable of forecasting the log change in battle-related deaths resulting from state-based armed conflict at the PRIO-GRID cell-month level. The ConvLSTM outperforms the benchmark model provided by the ViEWS team and performs comparably to the best models submitted to the competition. In addition to providing a technical description of the ConvLSTM, I evaluate the model\u2019s out-of-sample performance and interrogate a selection of interesting model forecasts. I find that the model relies heavily on lagged levels of battle-related fatalities to forecast future decreases in violence. The model struggles to forecast escalations in violence and tends to underpredict the magnitude of escalation while overpredicting the spatial spread of escalation. El concurso de predicciones del sistema de alerta temprana sobre la violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) de 2020 desafi\u00f3 a los participantes a producir modelos predictivos de conflictos pol\u00edticos violentos a altas resoluciones espaciales y temporales. Este documento presenta una red neuronal recurrente de memoria convolucional a corto y largo plazo (convolutional long short-term memory, ConvLSTM) capaz de predecir el cambio de registro en las muertes relacionadas con las batallas como resultado de los conflictos armados de estado a nivel de mes de celda de PRIO-GRID. La ConvLSTM supera el modelo de referencia proporcionado por el equipo de ViEWS y funciona de manera similar a los mejores modelos presentados en el concurso. Adem\u00e1s de proporcionar una descripci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica de la ConvLSTM, analizo el rendimiento del modelo fuera de la muestra y cuestiono una serie de interesantes previsiones del modelo. Considero que el modelo se basa, principalmente, en niveles rezagados de v\u00edctimas mortales a causa de las batallas para predecir las futuras disminuciones de la violencia. El modelo se esfuerza por predecir las escaladas de la violencia y tiende a predecir con poca frecuencia la magnitud de la escalada, pero con m\u00e1s frecuencia la propagaci\u00f3n espacial de esta.

We forecast changes in state based violence across Africa at the grid-month level. The results show that spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network models offer consistent improvements over the benchmark. The CAMEO-coded event data sometimes improve performance, but sometimes decrease performance. Finally, the choice of performance metric, whether it be the mean squared error or a proper metric such as the CRPS, has an impact on model selection. Each of these components\u2013algorithms, measures, and metrics\u2013can improve our forecasts and understanding of violence. En este art\u00edculo se exploran tres componentes diferentes del modelo para mejorar el rendimiento predictivo con respecto a la referencia ViEWS: una clase de redes neuronales que tienen en cuenta las dependencias espaciales y temporales, el uso de datos de eventos codificados por CAMEO, y la puntuaci\u00f3n de probabilidad de rango continuo (CRPS), que es una m\u00e9trica de puntuaci\u00f3n adecuada. Predecimos los cambios en la violencia estatal en toda \u00c1frica a nivel mensual. Los resultados muestran que los modelos de redes neuronales convolucionales de gr\u00e1ficos espacio-temporales ofrecen mejoras consistentes sobre el punto de referencia. Los datos de eventos codificados por CAMEO a veces mejoran el rendimiento, pero otras veces lo empeoran. Por \u00faltimo, la elecci\u00f3n de la m\u00e9trica de rendimiento, ya sea el error cuadr\u00e1tico medio o una m\u00e9trica propia como la CRPS, influye en la selecci\u00f3n del modelo. Cada uno de estos componentes (algoritmos, medidas y m\u00e9tricas) puede mejorar nuestras previsiones y nuestra comprensi\u00f3n de la violencia.

            "title": "Predicting (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting: Does it work?",
            "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a prediction model of (de-)escalation of sub-national violence using gradient boosting. The prediction model builds on updated data from the PRIO-GRID data aggregator, contributing to the ViEWS prediction competition by predicting changes in violence levels, operationalized using monthly fatalities at the 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5-degree grid (pgm) level. Our model's predictive performance in terms of mean square error (MSE) is marginally worse than the ViEWS baseline model and inferior to most other submissions, including our own supervised random forest model. However, while we knew that the model was comparatively worse than our random forest model in terms of MSE, we propose the gradient boosting model because it performed better where it matters\u2014in predicting when (de-)escalation happens. This choice means that we question the usefulness of using MSE for evaluating model performance and instead propose alternative performance measurements that are needed to understand the usefulness of predictive models. We argue that future endeavors using this outcome should measure their performance using the Concordance Correlation, which takes both the trueness and the precision elements of accuracy into account, and, unlike MSE, seems to be robust to the issues caused by zero inflation. Este art\u00edculo presenta un modelo de predicci\u00f3n de la desescalada de la violencia subnacional mediante el uso de la potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente. El modelo de predicci\u00f3n se basa en los datos actualizados que provienen del agregador de datos de PRIO-GRID, contribuye al concurso de predicciones de ViEWS al predecir cambios en los niveles de violencia y es operacionalizado utilizando las muertes mensuales a nivel de cuadr\u00edcula de 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 grados (pgm). El rendimiento predictivo de nuestro modelo desde el punto de vista del error cuadr\u00e1tico medio (mean square error, MSE) es ligeramente peor que el modelo de referencia del sistema de alerta temprana sobre la violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS) e inferior en relaci\u00f3n con la mayor\u00eda de las otras presentaciones, incluido nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio y supervisado. No obstante, si bien sab\u00edamos que el modelo era comparativamente peor que nuestro modelo de bosque aleatorio en relaci\u00f3n con el MSE, proponemos el modelo de potenciaci\u00f3n del gradiente porque funcion\u00f3 mejor en el aspecto que importa: predecir cu\u00e1ndo ocurre la desescalada. Esta elecci\u00f3n significa que cuestionamos la utilidad del uso del MSE para evaluar el rendimiento del modelo y, en cambio, proponemos mediciones de rendimiento alternativas que son necesarias para comprender la utilidad de los modelos predictivos. Sostenemos que, en los futuros proyectos en los que se utilice este resultado, se deber\u00eda medir el rendimiento mediante la correlaci\u00f3n de concordancia, la cual tiene en cuenta tanto los elementos de veracidad como los de precisi\u00f3n de la exactitud y, a diferencia del MSE, parece ser resistente a los problemas generados por la inflaci\u00f3n cero. Cet article pr\u00e9sente un mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction de la (d\u00e9s)escalade de la violence infranationale utilisant un boosting de gradient. Ce mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction repose sur des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 jour de l\u2019agr\u00e9gateur de donn\u00e9es de la grille PRIO. Il contribue au concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) en pr\u00e9disant les \u00e9volutions des niveaux de violence qui sont op\u00e9rationnalis\u00e9s sur la base du nombre mensuel de d\u00e9c\u00e8s au niveau 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5 degr\u00e9 de la grille (PGM). Les performances pr\u00e9dictives de notre mod\u00e8le en termes d\u2019erreur quadratique moyenne (EQM) sont l\u00e9g\u00e8rement moins bonnes que celles du mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ViEWS et inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la plupart des autres mod\u00e8les soumis, y compris \u00e0 celles de notre propre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire supervis\u00e9e. Cependant, bien que nous sachions que ce mod\u00e8le \u00e0 boosting de gradient \u00e9tait comparativement moins bon que notre mod\u00e8le \u00e0 for\u00eat al\u00e9atoire en termes d\u2019EQM, nous l\u2019avons propos\u00e9 car il \u00e9tait plus efficace dans le domaine qui compte : la pr\u00e9diction du moment auquel une (d\u00e9s)escalade interviendrait. Ce choix signifie que nous remettons en question l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019EQM pour \u00e9valuer les performances des mod\u00e8les et nous proposons au lieu de cela des mesures de performances alternatives n\u00e9cessaires pour comprendre l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9dictifs. Nous soutenons que les futurs efforts utilisant ce r\u00e9sultat devraient plut\u00f4t mesurer leurs performances \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la Corr\u00e9lation de concordance, qui prend \u00e0 la fois en compte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments Exactitude et Pr\u00e9cision et qui, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019EQM, semble \u00eatre robuste face aux probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l\u2019inflation z\u00e9ro.",

            "title": "United they stand: Findings from an escalation prediction competition",
            "abstract": "Abstract This article presents results and lessons learned from a prediction competition organized by ViEWS to improve collective scientific knowledge on forecasting (de-)escalation in Africa. The competition call asked participants to forecast changes in state-based violence for the true future (October 2020\u2013March 2021) as well as for a held-out test partition. An external scoring committee, independent from both the organizers and participants, was formed to evaluate the models based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria, including performance, novelty, uniqueness, and replicability. All models contributed to advance the research frontier by providing novel methodological or theoretical insight, including new data, or adopting innovative model specifications. While we discuss several facets of the competition that could be improved moving forward, the collection passes an important test. When we build a simple ensemble prediction model\u2014which draws on the unique insights of each contribution to differing degrees\u2014we can measure an improvement in the prediction from the group, over and above what the average individual model can achieve. This wisdom of the crowd effect suggests that future competitions that build on both the successes and failures of ours, can contribute to scientific knowledge by incentivizing diverse contributions as well as focusing a group\u2019s attention on a common problem. Este art\u00edculo presenta los resultados y las ense\u00f1anzas extra\u00eddas en el marco de un certamen de predicci\u00f3n organizado por los responsables del proyecto Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early-Warning System, ViEWS) con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar los conocimientos cient\u00edficos colectivos sobre la previsi\u00f3n de la (des)escalada en el continente africano. En el certamen se pidi\u00f3 a los participantes que desarrollaran una previsi\u00f3n con respecto a los cambios en la violencia estatal para el futuro real (de octubre de 2020 a marzo de 2021), as\u00ed como para una muestra de prueba que se mantendr\u00eda. Se form\u00f3 un comit\u00e9 de calificaci\u00f3n externo, independiente tanto de los organizadores como de los participantes, para evaluar los modelos en funci\u00f3n de criterios cualitativos y cuantitativos, como el rendimiento, la novedad, la singularidad y la replicabilidad. Todos los modelos contribuyeron a avanzar en la frontera de la investigaci\u00f3n mediante el aporte de nuevos conocimientos metodol\u00f3gicos o te\u00f3ricos, la inclusi\u00f3n de nuevos datos o la adopci\u00f3n de especificaciones innovadoras del modelo. Aunque se debari\u00f3 sobre varios aspectos del certamen que podr\u00edan mejorarse de cara al futuro, lo que se recopil\u00f3 pas\u00f3 una prueba importante. Cuando se construye un simple modelo de predicci\u00f3n de conjunto, que se basa en los conocimientos \u00fanicos de cada contribuci\u00f3n en diferentes grados, se puede medir una mejora en la predicci\u00f3n del grupo, por encima de lo que el modelo individual promedio puede lograr. Este efecto de la sabidur\u00eda de la multitud sugiere que los futuros cert\u00e1menes que se basen tanto en los \u00e9xitos como en los fracasos propios, pueden contribuir al conocimiento cient\u00edfico incentivando diversas contribuciones, as\u00ed como centrando la atenci\u00f3n de un grupo en un problema com\u00fan. Cet article pr\u00e9sente les r\u00e9sultats et les enseignements tir\u00e9s d\u2019un concours de pr\u00e9diction organis\u00e9 par ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) pour am\u00e9liorer nos connaissances scientifiques collectives en pr\u00e9vision de la (d\u00e9s)escalade de la violence sur le continent africain. L\u2019appel \u00e0 concours demandait aux participants de pr\u00e9voir les \u00e9volutions de la violence \u00e9tatique pour le futur r\u00e9el (octobre 2020-mars 2021) ainsi que pour une partition test retenue. Un comit\u00e9 de notation externe, ind\u00e9pendant \u00e0 la fois des organisateurs et des participants, a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer les mod\u00e8les \u00e0 la fois sur des crit\u00e8res qualitatifs et quantitatifs, notamment sur leurs performances, leur nouveaut\u00e9, leur unicit\u00e9 et leur reproductibilit\u00e9. Tous les mod\u00e8les ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire avancer la fronti\u00e8re des recherches en apportant un \u00e9clairage m\u00e9thodologique ou th\u00e9orique in\u00e9dit, en incluant de nouvelles donn\u00e9es ou en adoptant des caract\u00e9ristiques de mod\u00e8le innovantes. Bien que nous abordions plusieurs facettes du concours qui pourraient \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9es en allant de l\u2019avant, l\u2019ensemble de mod\u00e8les a r\u00e9ussi un test important. Lorsque nous concevons un mod\u00e8le de pr\u00e9diction par ensemble simple - qui s\u2019appuie sur les renseignements uniques de chaque contribution aux diff\u00e9rents degr\u00e9s -, nous pouvons mesurer une am\u00e9lioration de la pr\u00e9diction du groupe par rapport \u00e0 ce que le mod\u00e8le individuel moyen permet d\u2019obtenir. Cet effet de sagesse de la foule sugg\u00e8re que les futurs concours, qui s\u2019appuieront \u00e0 la fois sur les r\u00e9ussites et les \u00e9checs du n\u00f4tre, pourront contribuer aux connaissances scientifiques en encourageant des contributions diverses et en concentrant l\u2019attention d\u2019un groupe sur un probl\u00e8me commun.",

            "title": "Forecasting conflict in Africa with automated machine learning systems",
            "abstract": "Abstract The ViEWS problem is to forecast changes in the level of state-based violence for each of the next six months at the PRIO-GRID and country level. For this competition and toward the goal of improving sub-national and country level forecasts, we experiment with combinations of automated machine learning (autoML) systems and limited datasets that emphasize the endogenous nature of conflict. Two core findings emerge: autoML improves predictive performance and the Dynamics model performs best. The data used for the Dynamics model is limited to measures of state-based violence built from the event-level violence data plus those describing the spatial and temporal structure of the data. The intent is to capture spatial and temporal conflict dynamics while not overfitting to exogenous factors, which is especially problematic with flexible autoML algorithms and the types of highly disaggregate data used here. At the PGM level, this model won the ViEWS competition for \u201cpredictive accuracy\u201d and split the win for \u201coriginality.\u201d Beyond the ViEWS competition, we expect conflict forecasting models that couple advanced autoML systems with variables that reflect a diverse set of conflict dynamics to have high predictive performance, especially at sub-national and sub-annual aggregations. El problema del ViEWS es que predice los cambios en el nivel de violencia estatal de cada uno de los pr\u00f3ximos seis meses a nivel de PRIO-GRID y de pa\u00eds. En el marco de esta competencia y con el objetivo de mejorar las predicciones a nivel regional y nacional, probamos combinaciones de sistemas de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico (autoML) y conjuntos de datos limitados que ponen de relieve la naturaleza end\u00f3gena de los conflictos. Hay dos resultados principales: el autoML mejora el rendimiento predictivo y el modelo Dynamics es el que mejor funciona. Los datos utilizados para el modelo Dynamics se limitan a las medidas de la violencia a nivel estatal establecidas a partir de los datos de la violencia sobre eventos m\u00e1s los que describen la estructura espacial y temporal de los datos. La intenci\u00f3n es captar la din\u00e1mica espacial y temporal de los conflictos sin caer en el exceso de ajuste de los factores ex\u00f3genos, lo que supone un problema, sobre todo con los algoritmos autoML flexibles y los tipos de datos altamente desagregados que se utilizan aqu\u00ed. A nivel de PGM, este modelo gan\u00f3 la competencia del ViEWS tanto por su \u201cprecisi\u00f3n predictiva\u201d como por su \u201coriginalidad\u201d. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la competencia del ViEWS, esperamos que los modelos de previsi\u00f3n de conflictos que combinan sistemas avanzados de autoML con variables que reflejan un conjunto diverso de din\u00e1micas de conflicto tengan un alto resultado predictivo, sobre todo en agregados regionales y semestrales. La probl\u00e9matique du ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence) est de pr\u00e9voir les \u00e9volutions du niveau de violence \u00e9tatique pour chacun des six prochains mois au niveau de la grille PRIO et au niveau national. Pour ce concours et dans l\u2019objectif d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les pr\u00e9visions au niveau infranational et au niveau national, nous avons exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 des combinaisons de syst\u00e8mes de machine learning automatis\u00e9s (autoML) et de jeux de donn\u00e9es limit\u00e9s mettant l\u2019accent sur la nature endog\u00e8ne des conflits. Deux r\u00e9sultats fondamentaux sont apparus : l\u2019autoML am\u00e9liore les performances pr\u00e9dictives et le mod\u00e8le Dynamiques est le plus efficace. Les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es pour le mod\u00e8le Dynamiques sont limit\u00e9es aux mesures de la violence \u00e9tatique \u00e9tablies \u00e0 partir des donn\u00e9es sur la violence au niveau des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ainsi que de celles qui d\u00e9crivent la structure spatiale et temporelle des donn\u00e9es. L\u2019objectif est de capturer les dynamiques spatiales et temporelles des conflits tout en \u00e9vitant un ajustement excessif aux facteurs exog\u00e8nes, ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement probl\u00e9matique avec les algorithmes d\u2019autoML flexibles et les types de donn\u00e9es tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9g\u00e9es qui sont utilis\u00e9s ici. Au niveau PGM, ce mod\u00e8le a remport\u00e9 le concours ViEWS \u00e0 la fois dans les cat\u00e9gories \u00ab Pr\u00e9cision pr\u00e9dictive \u00bb et \u00ab Originalit\u00e9 \u00bb. Au-del\u00e0 du concours ViEWS, nous nous attendons \u00e0 ce que les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9vision des conflits qui allient des syst\u00e8mes avanc\u00e9s d\u2019autoML \u00e0 des variables refl\u00e9tant un ensemble diversifi\u00e9 de dynamiques de conflits aient de hautes performances pr\u00e9dictives, en particulier aux niveaux d\u2019agr\u00e9gation infranationaux et infra-annuels.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Can history predict the escalation of future violence? This research note evaluates the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) Prediction Competition. Existing research on civil conflict shows violence is a persistent and recurring process, often shaping the direction of future conflicts. Building on this insight, I build a RNN model to examine how well historical patterns in conflict predict long-term escalation trends. A RNN is a simple, but powerful machine learning tool for time series forecasting due to its capacity to learn long sequences of information. I show that an RNN model can produce relatively accurate forecasts due to systematic patterns in conflict processes, consistent with existing research on \u201cconflict traps.\u201d The results provide important lessons for conflict forecasting and ground opportunities for using RNN models in future political science research. \u00bfLa historia puede predecir el aumento de la violencia en el futuro? Esta nota de investigaci\u00f3n eval\u00faa el uso de una red neuronal recurrente (Recurrent Neural Network, RNN) para la competencia de predicciones del Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early Warning System, ViEWS). Las investigaciones existentes sobre los conflictos civiles demuestran que la violencia es un proceso persistente y recurrente que, a menudo, da forma a la direcci\u00f3n de futuros conflictos. Con base en esta percepci\u00f3n, elaboro un modelo de RNN para examinar la eficacia de los patrones hist\u00f3ricos de los conflictos al momento de predecir tendencias a largo plazo. La RNN es una herramienta de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico sencilla, pero poderosa, para la predicci\u00f3n de series temporales debido a su capacidad para aprender secuencias extensas de informaci\u00f3n. Los resultados demuestran que el modelo genera pron\u00f3sticos relativamente precisos en los Estados d\u00e9biles y fallidos, lo cual coincide con las investigaciones existentes sobre las \u201ctrampas de conflictos.\u201d No obstante, el modelo presenta dificultades para predecir nuevos conflictos civiles; esto es coincidente con las teor\u00edas informativas sobre el inicio de conflictos. Los resultados brindan lecciones importantes para la predicci\u00f3n de conflictos y demuestran oportunidades para las aplicaciones de RNN en futuras investigaciones sobre ciencias pol\u00edticas. L\u2019histoire peut-elle permettre de pr\u00e9dire l\u2019escalade future de la violence ? Cet expos\u00e9 de recherche \u00e9value l\u2019utilization d\u2019un R\u00e9seau de neurones r\u00e9currents pour le concours de pr\u00e9diction ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, syst\u00e8me d\u2019alerte pr\u00e9coce sur la violence). Des recherches existantes sur les conflits civils montrent que la violence est un processus persistant et r\u00e9current qui fa\u00e7onne souvent l\u2019orientation des conflits futurs. Je me suis appuy\u00e9 sur cette id\u00e9e pour d\u00e9velopper un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9seau de neurones r\u00e9currents dans l\u2019objectif d\u2019examiner \u00e0 quel point les sch\u00e9mas historiques des conflits pouvaient permettre de pr\u00e9dire des tendances \u00e0 long terme. Un r\u00e9seau de neurones r\u00e9currents est un outil de machine learning simple mais puissant pour la pr\u00e9vision de s\u00e9ries chronologiques du fait de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre de longues s\u00e9quences d\u2019informations.

            "title": "A shape-based approach to conflict forecasting",
            "abstract": "Abstract Do conflict processes exhibit repeating patterns over time? And if so, can we exploit the recurring shapes and structures of the time series to forecast the evolution of conflict? Theory has long focused on the sequence of events that precedes conflicts (e.g., escalation or brinkmanship). Yet, current empirical research is unable to represent these complex interactions unfolding over time because it attempts to match cases on the raw value of covariates, and not on their structure or shape. As a result, it cannot easily represent real-world relations which may, for example, follow a long alternation of escalation and d\u00e9tente, in various orders and at various speeds. Here, I aim to address these issues using recent machine-learning methods derived from pattern recognition in time series to study the dynamics of casualties in civil war processes. I find that the methods perform well on out-of-sample forecasts of the count of the number of fatalities per month from state-based conflict. In particular, our results yield Mean Squared Errors that are lower than the competition benchmark. We discuss the implication for conflict research and the importance of comparing entire sequences rather than isolated observations in time. \u00bfLos procesos de conflicto muestran patrones que se repiten con el paso del tiempo? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfpodemos aprovechar las formas y estructuras recurrentes de las series temporales para prever la evoluci\u00f3n del conflicto? Durante mucho tiempo, la teor\u00eda se ha centrado en la secuencia de acontecimientos que preceden a los conflictos (por ejemplo, la escalada o la pol\u00edtica suicida). Sin embargo, la investigaci\u00f3n emp\u00edrica actual es incapaz de representar estas complejas interacciones que surgen a lo largo del tiempo porque trata de comparar los casos en funci\u00f3n del valor bruto de las covariables, y no de su estructura o forma. Por consiguiente, no puede representar f\u00e1cilmente las relaciones del mundo real que, por ejemplo, pueden seguir una larga alternancia de escalada y distensi\u00f3n, en varios \u00f3rdenes y a distintas velocidades. En este art\u00edculo, mi objetivo es abordar estas cuestiones utilizando m\u00e9todos recientes de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico derivados del reconocimiento de patrones en series temporales para estudiar la din\u00e1mica de las bajas en los procesos de guerra civil. Me parece que los m\u00e9todos funcionan bien en las previsiones fuera de muestra y, en particular, arrojan Errores Cuadr\u00e1ticos Medios inferiores a la referencia de la competencia. Se analizan las implicaciones para la investigaci\u00f3n de conflictos y la importancia de comparar secuencias completas en lugar de observaciones aisladas en el tiempo. Les processus de conflit pr\u00e9sentent-ils des sch\u00e9mas qui se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent au fil du temps ? Et si tel est le cas, pouvons-nous exploiter ces formes et structures r\u00e9currentes de la chronologie pour pr\u00e9dire l\u2019\u00e9volution du conflit ? La th\u00e9orie s\u2019est longtemps concentr\u00e9e sur la s\u00e9quence d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de les conflits (p. ex. escalade ou strat\u00e9gie du bord de l\u2019ab\u00eeme). Pourtant, les recherches empiriques actuelles ne sont pas en mesure de repr\u00e9senter ces interactions complexes qui se d\u00e9roulent au fil du temps car elles tentent d\u2019apparier des cas sur la base de la valeur brute de leurs covariables, et non sur celle de leur structure ou de leur forme. Elles ne parviennent par cons\u00e9quent pas \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter facilement les relations du monde r\u00e9el qui peuvent, par exemple, suivre une longue alternance entre escalade et d\u00e9tente, dans divers ordres et \u00e0 diverses vitesses. Mon objectif est ici d\u2019aborder ces probl\u00e8mes en utilisant de r\u00e9centes m\u00e9thodes de machine learning d\u00e9riv\u00e9es de la reconnaissance des sch\u00e9mas des chronologies pour \u00e9tudier les dynamiques des pertes lors des processus de guerre civile. Je constate que ces m\u00e9thodes sont performantes pour les pr\u00e9visions hors \u00e9chantillon, et en particulier qu\u2019elles produisent des erreurs quadratiques moyennes inf\u00e9rieures par comparaison \u00e0 leurs m\u00e9thodes concurrentes.

            "abstract": "Abstract The article examines the potential of multi-model ensemble learning techniques for conflict research and applies an ensemble averaging framework to the prediction task of the 2020 ViEWS armed conflict forecasting competition. The goal is to predict changes of conflict intensity in fifty-four African countries for 6 months into the future. The presented ensemble combines six individual models, using two tree-based learning algorithms, incorporating two distinct data foundations and two geographical selections into a unified forecasting framework. In one of the two applied datasets, the combination of conflict variables from recent months is implemented to train for inter-temporal connections of previous conflict levels. The second dataset contains important structural, economic, political, and social information relevant for each individual case. Both datasets are used to predict changes in conflict levels. The framework structure and the combination method are presented in detail, and the prediction results for both test periods between 2014\u20132016 and 2016\u20132019 are evaluated regarding their quality. The effect of the ensemble structure and the performance of all individual components is comprehensively examined. Real forecasts over the timespan of six months into the future are presented for the upcoming months of October 2020 through March 2021 generated from data available until August 2020. The paper concludes with the presentation and examination of three selected case forecasts for Egypt, Cameroon, and Mozambique.

            "title": "The role of governmental weapons procurements in forecasting monthly fatalities in intrastate conflicts: A semiparametric hierarchical hurdle model",
            "abstract": "Abstract Accurate and interpretable forecasting models predicting spatially and temporally fine-grained changes in the numbers of intrastate conflict casualties are of crucial importance for policymakers and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Using a count data approach, we propose a hierarchical hurdle regression model to address the corresponding prediction challenge at the monthly PRIO-grid level. More precisely, we model the intensity of local armed conflict at a specific point in time as a three-stage process. Stages one and two of our approach estimate whether we will observe any casualties at the country- and grid-cell-level, respectively, while stage three applies a regression model for truncated data to predict the number of such fatalities conditional upon the previous two stages. Within this modeling framework, we focus on the role of governmental arms imports as a processual factor allowing governments to intensify or deter from fighting. We further argue that a grid cell\u2019s geographic remoteness is bound to moderate the effects of these military buildups. Out-of-sample predictions corroborate the effectiveness of our parsimonious and theory-driven model, which enables full transparency combined with accuracy in the forecasting process. Los modelos de previsi\u00f3n precisos e interpretables que predicen los cambios a nivel espacial y temporal en la cantidad de v\u00edctimas de los conflictos intraestatales son de vital importancia para los responsables pol\u00edticos y las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) internacionales. Utilizando un enfoque de datos de recuento, proponemos un modelo de regresi\u00f3n Hurdle jer\u00e1rquico para abordar el correspondiente reto de predicci\u00f3n a nivel mensual de PRIO-GRID. M\u00e1s concretamente, modelamos la intensidad del conflicto armado local en un momento determinado como un proceso de tres etapas. Las etapas uno y dos de nuestro enfoque estiman si observaremos alguna v\u00edctima a nivel de pa\u00eds y de celda de la red, respectivamente, mientras que la etapa tres aplica un modelo de regresi\u00f3n para datos truncados con el prop\u00f3sito de predecir la cantidad potencial de dichas v\u00edctimas mortales en funci\u00f3n de las dos etapas anteriores. Dentro de este marco de modelizaci\u00f3n, nos centramos en el rol de las importaciones de armas por parte de los gobiernos como un factor de proceso que permite a los gobiernos intensificar o impedir los enfrentamientos. Adem\u00e1s, sostenemos que la lejan\u00eda geogr\u00e1fica de una c\u00e9lula de la red est\u00e1 destinada a moderar los efectos de estas concentraciones militares. Las predicciones fuera de la muestra corroboran la eficacia de nuestro modelo parsimonioso y basado en la teor\u00eda, que permite una transparencia total combinada con precisi\u00f3n en el proceso de previsi\u00f3n. Les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9vision pr\u00e9cis et interpr\u00e9tables, qui permettent de pr\u00e9dire spatialement et temporellement les d\u00e9tails des changements dans les nombres de victimes de conflits intra-\u00e9tatiques, sont d\u2019une importance cruciale pour les d\u00e9cideurs politiques et les organizations non gouvernementales (ONG) internationales. Nous adoptons une approche par donn\u00e9es de comptage et nous proposons un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gression hi\u00e9rarchique \u00e0 obstacle (hurdle) pour relever le d\u00e9fi de la pr\u00e9diction correspondante au niveau de la grille mensuelle du PRIO (Peace research institute Oslo, Institut de recherche sur la paix d\u2019Oslo). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, nous mod\u00e9lisons l\u2019intensit\u00e9 des conflits arm\u00e9s locaux \u00e0 un moment sp\u00e9cifique sous la forme d\u2019un processus en trois \u00e9tapes. Les \u00e9tapes un et deux de notre approche consistent \u00e0 estimer si nous observerons des pertes respectivement au niveau du pays et de la cellule de grille, tandis que l\u2019\u00e9tape trois consiste \u00e0 appliquer un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9gression pour les donn\u00e9es tronqu\u00e9es afin de pr\u00e9dire le nombre de ces pertes en fonction des deux \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Dans ce cadre de mod\u00e9lisation, nous nous concentrons sur le r\u00f4le des importations d\u2019armes gouvernementales en tant que facteur processuel permettant aux gouvernements d\u2019intensifier ou de dissuader les combats. Nous soutenons \u00e9galement que l\u2019isolement g\u00e9ographique d\u2019une cellule de la grille est susceptible de mod\u00e9rer les effets de ces renforcements militaires. Des pr\u00e9dictions hors \u00e9chantillon corroborent l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de notre mod\u00e8le parcimonieux fond\u00e9 sur la th\u00e9orie qui permet une totale transparence associ\u00e9e \u00e0 une pr\u00e9cision du processus de pr\u00e9vision.",

            "abstract": "Have great wars become less violent over time, and is there something we might identify as the long peace? We investigate statistical versions of such questions, by examining the number of battle-deaths in the Correlates of War dataset, with 95 interstate wars from 1816 to 2007. Previous research has found this series of wars to be stationary, with no apparent change over time. We develop a framework to find and assess a change-point in this battle-deaths series. Our change-point methodology takes into consideration the power law distribution of the data, models the full battle-deaths distribution, as opposed to focusing merely on the extreme tail, and evaluates the uncertainty in the estimation. Using this framework, we find evidence that the series has not been as stationary as past research has indicated. Our statistical sightings of better angels indicate that 1950 represents the most likely change-point in the battle-deaths series \u2013 the point in time where the battle-deaths distribution might have changed for the better.",

            "abstract": "In 2008, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency commissioned a database known as the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System to serve as the foundation for models capable of detecting and predicting increases in political conflict worldwide. Such models, by signalling expected increases in political conflict, would help inform and prepare policymakers to react accordingly to conflict proliferation both domestically and internationally. Using data from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, we construct and test a self-exciting point process, or Hawkes process, model to describe and predict amounts of domestic, political conflict; we focus on Colombia and Venezuela as examples for this model. By comparing the accuracy of fitted models to the observed data, we find that we are able to closely describe occurrences of conflict in each country. Thus, using this model can allow policymakers to anticipate relative increases in the amount of domestic political conflict following major events.",

            "abstract": "How will local violent conflict patterns in sub-Saharan Africa evolve until the middle of the 21st century? Africa is recognized as a particularly vulnerable continent to environmental and climate change since a large portion of its population is poor and reliant on rain-fed agriculture. We use a climate-sensitive approach to model sub-Saharan African violence in the past (geolocated to the nearest settlements) and then forecast future violence using sociopolitical factors such as population size and political rights (governance), coupled with temperature anomalies. Our baseline model is calibrated using 1\u00b0 gridded monthly data from 1980 to 2012 at a finer spatio-temporal resolution than existing conflict forecasts. We present multiple forecasts of violence under alternative climate change scenarios (optimistic and current global trajectories), of political rights scenarios (improvement and decline), and population projections (low and high fertility). We evaluate alternate shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) by plotting violence forecasts over time and by detailed mapping of recent and future levels of violence by decade. The forecasts indicate that a growing population and rising temperatures will lead to higher levels of violence in sub-Saharan Africa if political rights do not improve. If political rights continue to improve at the same rate as observed over the last three decades, there is reason for optimism that overall levels of violence will hold steady or even decline in Africa, in spite of projected population increases and rising temperatures.",

During 2015, we issued new forecasts each month, with a delay as short as five days and no longer than two weeks into each six-month forecasting window. This article describes the approach we use to generate our forecasts and presents several examples of how we present forecasts. The forecasts are derived from a statistical ensemble of seven thematic models, each based on a split-population duration model that aims to capture a specific argument or related set of covariates. This approach is modular in that thematic models can be swapped out or new models integrated, and it lessens the need for generalist \u2018kitchen sink\u2019 models. Together, the models achieve high out-of-sample accuracy. Based on our experience, we draw conclusions about the practical, policy, and scientific aspects of this and similar undertakings. These include thoughts on how to evaluate and present forecasts, the potential role of ensembles in model comparison, the role of ensembles and prediction in causal research, and considerations for future efforts in forecasting and predictive modeling.",

            "abstract": "Advances in the study of civil war have led to the proliferation of event count data, and to a corresponding increase in the use of (zero-inflated) count models for the quantitative analysis of civil conflict events. Our ability to effectively use these techniques is met with two current limitations. First, researchers do not yet have a definitive answer as to whether zero-inflated count models are a verifiably better approach to civil conflict modeling than are \u2018less assuming\u2019 approaches such as negative binomial count models. Second, the accurate analysis of conflict-event counts with count models \u2013 zero-inflated or otherwise \u2013 is severely limited by the absence of an effective framework for the evaluation of predictive accuracy, which is an empirical approach that is of increasing importance to conflict modelers. This article rectifies both of these deficiencies. Specifically, this study presents count forecasting techniques for the evaluation and comparison of count models' predictive accuracies. Using these techniques alongside out-of-sample forecasts, it then definitively verifies \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that zero-inflated count models are superior to comparable non-inflated models for the study of intrastate conflict events.",

            "abstract": "Abstract An abundance of large data sets and improved estimation methods have enabled conflict researchers to estimate the risk of war or terrorist incidents quite precisely. However, as in the case of the prediction of particularly violent earthquakes, forecasting extremely bloody events in continuing conflicts has been difficult until now. This article reports how power laws can be used to predict extreme massacres ex post and ex ante. The power-law distribution that we use is based on the observation that standard probability distributions like the normal distribution typically underestimate the risk of such escalations. Using fatality data until the end of February 2013, we calculate the probability of at least one single event with 250 or more dead civilians at 80% (59%\u201394%) and between March and May 2013 of up to 48%. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of these findings and argue that the forecasts could provide a transparent risk assessment tool to decision makers.

            "abstract": "Large-n studies of conflict have produced a large number of statistically significant results but little accurate guidance in terms of anticipating the onset of conflict. The authors argue that too much attention has been paid to finding statistically significant relationships, while too little attention has been paid to finding variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars. The result can be a distorted view of what matters most to the onset of conflict. Although these models may not be intended to be predictive models, prescriptions based on these models are generally based on statistical significance, and the predictive attributes of the underlying models are generally ignored. These predictions should not be ignored, but rather need to be heuristically evaluated because they may shed light on the veracity of the models. In this study, the authors conduct a side-by-side comparison of the statistical significance and predictive power of the different variables used in two of the most influential models of civil war. The results provide a clear demonstration of how potentially misleading the traditional focus on statistical significance can be. Until out-of-sample heuristics \u2014 especially including predictions \u2014 are part of the normal evaluative tools in conflict research, we are unlikely to make sufficient theoretical progress beyond broad statements that point to GDP per capita and population as the major causal factors accounting for civil war onset.",

The text features are generated from over 3.5 million newspaper articles using a so\u2010called topic\u2010model.

            "abstract": "There is a growing interest in prevention in several policy areas and this provides a strong motivation for an improved integration of forecasting with machine learning into models of decision making. In this article we propose a framework to tackle conflict prevention. A key problem of conflict forecasting for prevention is that predicting the start of conflict in previously peaceful countries needs to overcome a low baseline risk. To make progress in this hard problem this project combines a newspaper-text corpus of more than 4 million articles with unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The output of the forecast model is then integrated into a simple static framework in which a decision maker decides on the optimal number of interventions to minimize the total cost of conflict and intervention. This exercise highlights the potential cost savings of prevention for which reliable forecasts are a prerequisite.

Such projections are currently neither included in the development of socioeconomic scenarios or climate change impact assessments nor part of global agenda-setting policy processes. In contrast, in other fields of inquiry, long-term projections and scenario studies are established and relevant for both strategical agenda-setting and applied policies. Although making projections of armed conflict risk in response to climate change is surrounded by uncertainty, there are good reasons to further develop such scenario-based projections. In this perspective article we discuss why quantifying implications of climate change for future armed conflict risk is inherently uncertain, but necessary for shaping sustainable future policy agendas. We argue that both quantitative and qualitative projections can have a purpose in future climate change impact assessments and put out the challenges this poses for future research.",

            "abstract": "Climate change threatens core dimensions of human security, including economic prosperity, food availability, and societal stability. In recent years, war-torn regions such as Afghanistan and Yemen have harbored severe humanitarian crises, compounded by climate-related hazards. These cases epitomize the powerful but presently incompletely appreciated links between vulnerability, conflict, and climate-related impacts. In this article, we develop a unified conceptual model of these phenomena by connecting three fields of research that traditionally have had little interaction: ( a) determinants of social vulnerability to climate change, ( b) climatic drivers of armed conflict risk, and ( c) societal impacts of armed conflict. In doing so, we demonstrate how many of the conditions that shape vulnerability to climate change also increase the likelihood of climate\u2013conflict interactions and, furthermore, that impacts from armed conflict aggravate these conditions. The end result may be a vicious circle locking affected societies in a trap of violence, vulnerability, and climate change impacts.

In light of predicted shifts in climate patterns and the potentially resulting battle for increasingly scarce resources, it is widely acknowledged that there is an actual risk of increased armed conflict. To efficiently plan and implement adaptation and mitigation measures, it is key to first obtain an understanding of conflict drivers and spatial conflict risk distribution. And second, conflict risk needs to be projected to a given point in the future to be able to prepare accordingly. With CoPro, building and running models investigating the interplay between conflict and climate is made easier. By means of a clear workflow, maps of conflict risk for today as well as the future can be produced. Despite the structured workflow, CoPro caters for a variety of settings and input data, thereby capturing the multitude of facets of the climate-environment-conflict nexus.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Previous research by Goldstone et al. (2010) generated a highly accurate predictive model of state-level political instability. Notably, this model identifies political institutions \u2013 and partial democracy with factionalism, specifically \u2013 as the most compelling factors explaining when and where instability events are likely to occur. This article reassesses the model\u2019s explanatory power and makes three related points: (1) the model\u2019s predictive power varies substantially over time; (2) its predictive power peaked in the period used for out-of-sample validation (1995\u20132004) in the original study and (3) the model performs relatively poorly in the more recent period. The authors find that this decline is not simply due to the Arab Uprisings, instability events that occurred in autocracies. Similar issues are found with attempts to predict nonviolent uprisings (Chenoweth and Ulfelder 2017) and armed conflict onset and continuation (Hegre et al. 2013). These results inform two conclusions: (1) the drivers of instability are not constant over time and (2) care must be exercised in interpreting prediction exercises as evidence in favor or dispositive of theoretical mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and armed civil conflict are both linked to socioeconomic development, although conditions that facilitate peace may not necessarily facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. While economic growth lowers the risk of conflict, it is generally associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions and costs of climate mitigation policies. This study investigates the links between growth, climate change, and conflict by simulating future civil conflict using new scenario data for five alternative socioeconomic pathways with different mitigation and adaptation assumptions, known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We develop a statistical model of the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables on country-specific conflict incidence, 1960\u20132013. We then forecast the annual incidence of conflict, 2014\u20132100, along the five SSPs. We find that SSPs with high investments in broad societal development are associated with the largest reduction in conflict risk. This is most pronounced for the least developed countries\u2014poverty alleviation and human capital investments in poor countries are much more effective instruments to attain global peace and stability than further improvements to wealthier economies. Moreover, the SSP that describes a sustainability pathway, which poses the lowest climate change challenges, is as conducive to global peace as the conventional development pathway.",

We formulate a model where an incumbent or opposition can use violence to maintain or acquire power to study which political and economic factors drive one-sided or two-sided violence (repression or civil war). The model predicts a hierarchy of violence states from peace via repression to civil war, and suggests a natural empirical approach. Exploiting only within-country variation in the data, we show that violence is associated with shocks that can affect wages and aid. As in the theory, these effects are only present where political institutions are non-cohesive.",

            "abstract": "Civil wars cluster in space as well as time. In this study, we develop and evaluate empirically alternative explanations for this observed clustering. We consider whether the spatial pattern of intrastate conflict simply stems from a similar distribution of relevant country attributes or whether conflicts indeed constitute a threat to other proximate states. Our results strongly suggest that there is a genuine neighborhood effect of armed conflict, over and beyond what individual country characteristics can account for. We then examine whether the risk of contagion depends on the degree of exposure to proximate conflicts. Contrary to common expectations, this appears not to be the case. Rather, we find that conflict is more likely when there are ethnic ties to groups in a neighboring conflict and that contagion is primarily a feature of separatist conflicts. This suggests that transnational ethnic linkages constitute a central mechanism of conflict contagion.",

            "abstract": "The hypothesis that democratization triggers political violence has been proposed repeatedly in the quantitative literature, but it remains controversial with respect to both interstate and civil wars. Current empirical research continues to be afflicted by methodological and data problems related to the measurement of democracy and the task of detecting changes in such scores. In order to gain further clarity into the link between democratization and civil war, the current study introduces a new period-finding algorithm that is able to detect periods of democratization and autocratization. This allows for a more flexible way of finding directional changes in governance indicators than is possible with the rigid lag structures commonly employed in previous studies. When regressed on various measures of civil-war onset, the indicator for the initiation of a period of democratization has a strong and robust effect on conflict even in the presence of static measures of regime type. The same applies to autocratization, but its impact is much more sudden than that of democratization. Moreover, we find that the democratization effect is limited to governmental rather than territorial conflicts. Further research will be needed to confirm these results in terms of the relevant causal mechanisms, especially in ethno-nationalist civil wars.",

            "abstract": "Significance A robust debate about the effects of climate change on conflict occurrences has attained wide public and policy attention, with sub-Saharan Africa generally viewed as most susceptible to increased conflict risk. Using a new disaggregated dataset of violence and climate anomaly measures (temperature and precipitation variations from normal) for sub-Saharan Africa 1980\u20132012, we consider political, economic, and geographic factors, not only climate metrics, in assessing the chances of increased violence. The location and timing of violence are influenced less by climate anomalies than by key political, economic, and geographic factors. Overall, the temperature effect is statistically significant, but important inconsistencies in the relationship between temperature extremes and conflict are evident in more nuanced relationships than have been previously identified. Ongoing debates in the academic community and in the public policy arena continue without clear resolution about the significance of global climate change for the risk of increased conflict. Sub-Saharan Africa is generally agreed to be the region most vulnerable to such climate impacts. Using a large database of conflict events and detailed climatological data covering the period 1980\u20132012, we apply a multilevel modeling technique that allows for a more nuanced understanding of a climate\u2013conflict link than has been seen heretofore. In the aggregate, high temperature extremes are associated with more conflict; however, different types of conflict and different subregions do not show consistent relationship with temperature deviations. Precipitation deviations, both high and low, are generally not significant. The location and timing of violence are influenced less by climate anomalies (temperature or precipitation variations from normal) than by key political, economic, and geographic factors. We find important distinctions in the relationship between temperature extremes and conflict by using multiple methods of analysis and by exploiting our time-series cross-sectional dataset for disaggregated analyses.",

            "abstract": "This letter reviews the scientific literature on whether and how environmental changes affect the risk of violent conflict. The available evidence from qualitative case studies indicates that environmental stress can contribute to violent conflict in some specific cases. Results from quantitative large-N studies, however, strongly suggest that we should be careful in drawing general conclusions. Those large-N studies that we regard as the most sophisticated ones obtain results that are not robust to alternative model specifications and, thus, have been debated. This suggests that environmental changes may, under specific circumstances, increase the risk of violent conflict, but not necessarily in a systematic way and unconditionally. Hence there is, to date, no scientific consensus on the impact of environmental changes on violent conflict. This letter also highlights the most important challenges for further research on the subject. One of the key issues is that the effects of environmental changes on violent conflict are likely to be contingent on a set of economic and political conditions that determine adaptation capacity. In the authors\u2019 view, the most important indirect effects are likely to lead from environmental changes via economic performance and migration to violent conflict.",

            "abstract": "This article discusses the General Aggression Model (GAM), which provides a comprehensive and integrative social-cognitive framework for understanding aggression and violence. After providing a brief description of the basic components of GAM, we discuss how it can be used to better understand 4 topics related to phenomena that occur primarily outside the laboratory and apply to a broad range of people. Specifically, we apply GAM to better understand intimate partner violence, intergroup violence, global climate change effects on violence, and suicide. We also explain how the tenets of GAM can be used to inform interventions aimed at reducing these forms of violence. Finally, we show how GAM can explain why people do not behave violently, such as in societies where violence is exceedingly rare. Applying GAM to violent behavior that occurs outside the laboratory adds to its explanatory power and enhances the external validity of its predictions. Because the 4 topics apply to such a broad range of people, GAM may have broader influence in fostering understanding of aggression in these domains. By increasing our understanding of the causes of violent behavior, GAM may help reduce it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)",

Using a host of different model specifications and alternative measures of drought, heat, and civil war, the paper concludes that climate variability is a poor predictor of armed conflict.

            "abstract": "Several studies show a beneficial effect of peacekeeping operations (PKOs). However, by looking at individual effect pathways (intensity, duration, recurrence, diffusion) in isolation, they underestimate the peacekeeping impact of PKOs. We propose a novel method of evaluating the combined impact across all pathways based on a statistical model of the efficacy of UN PKOs in preventing the onset, escalation, continuation, and recurrence of internal armed conflict. We run a set of simulations based on the statistical estimates to assess the impact of alternative UN policies for the 2001\u201313 period. If the UN had invested US$200 billion in PKOs with strong mandates, major armed conflict would have been reduced by up to two-thirds relative to a scenario without PKOs and 150,000 lives would have been saved over the 13-year period compared to a no-PKO scenario. UN peacekeeping is clearly a cost-effective way of increasing global security.",

We combine the CAMEO event-coding framework with Markov-switching and Bayesian vector autoregression models to meet these goals.

This article explores whether the incorporation of geography can help us make our forecasts of political violence more accurate. The authors describe a spatially and temporally autoregressive discrete regression model, following the framework of Geyer and Thompson. This model is applied to geo-located data on attributes and conflict events in Bosnia over the period from March 1992 to October 1995. Results show that there is a strong spatial as well as temporal dimension to the outbreak of violence in Bosnia. The authors then explore the use of this model for predicting future conflict. Using a simulation approach, the predictive accuracy of the spatial\u2014temporal model is compared to a standard regression model that only includes time lags. The results show that even in a difficult out-of-sample prediction task, the incorporation of space improves our forecasts of future conflict.",

Drawing on a contest success function model, we show that geographic factors (such as location, terrain, and natural resources) interact with rebel fighting capacity and together play a crucial role in determining the duration of conflict. Using precisely dated duration data in event history models and geographic data for the conflict location, we find that conflicts located at considerable distance from the main government stronghold, along remote international borders and in regions with valuable minerals last substantially longer. In addition, we find that rebel military capacity in its own right increases the prospects of a civil conflict ending within a short time period. Our findings imply that the distances an army must travel to project power, rebel fighting capacity, and characteristics of conflict region affect how a civil war is fought and who will prevail.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary conflict research usually measures the influence of ethnicity on conflict by capturing ethnic constellations as country-based indices, such as ethnic fractionalization or polarization. However, such aggregated measures are likely to conceal the actual operation of actor-specific mechanisms. In this article, therefore, we introduce a disaggregated model that measures ethnic groups' access to power. We do so by disaggregating both ethnicity and conflict to the level of explicitly geo-coded center-periphery dyads. This procedure allows us to measure the power balance between politically excluded ethnic groups and dominant actors in terms of group sizes, distances between the center and the periphery, and the roughness of the latter's terrain. We rely on geographic information systems (GIS) to compute demographic and ethno-geographic variables. The dyadic analysis enables us to show that exclusion of powerful ethnic minorities increases the likelihood of conflict considerably. In addition, we show that the risk of conflict is positively associated with the extent of rough terrain in the peripheral group's home region and its distance from the political center.",

These data contribute to the present state of quantitative research on violence against civilians in three important respects: the data provide actual estimates of civilians killed, the data are collected annually and the data are provided for both governments and rebel groups. Using these data, general trends and patterns are presented, showing that the post-Cold War era is characterized by periods of fairly low-scale violence punctuated by occasional sharp increases in violence against civilians. Furthermore, rebels tend to be more violent on the whole, while governments commit relatively little violence except in those few years which see mass killings. The article then examines some factors that have been found to predict genocide and evaluates how they correlate with one-sided violence as conceptualized here. A U-shaped correlation between regime type and one-sided violence is identified: while autocratic governments undertake higher levels of one-sided violence than other regime types, rebels are more violent in democratic countries.",

While neural networks originally attracted attention because they mirrored the structure of biological nervous systems, they are used increasingly to solve practical problems of prediction and classification. Neural networks may also be important for modeling international behavior because of structural similarities with some organizational processes used to determine foreign policy. In split-sample tests using the Butterworth international conflict data set, the neural network outperforms both discriminant analysis and ID3 in terms of accuracy; it is roughly comparable in accuracy to multinomial logit. The neural network is less successful than discriminant and logit at predicting nonmodal values of the dependent variable. The variables identified as important in the neural network appear to be similar to those significant in the discriminant analysis, but are quite different than those used by ID3.

            "abstract": "The proliferation of large, geographically disaggregated data on armed conflict, protest and other forms of political violence has led to a substantial development of research avenues. It has also brought with it numerous problems, both in terms of management of data quality and assurance of consistency. Dataset authors are generally aware of shortcomings in the sources they use, and alert users to such limitations. Still, researchers have been slow to provide solutions to these problems, even where they are clearly stated by dataset authors, in many cases due to the computational costliness of the canonical solutions. One such major but mostly ignored problem is the presence of large amounts of \u201cknown geographically imprecise\u201d (KGI) or \u201cknown temporally imprecise\u201d (KTI) observations in important datasets. In the spatial domain (KGI), dataset authors typically alert to geographical imprecision for 20\u201340% of observations . We introduce a simple, multiple-imputation based technique to address this issue. We show that the resulting imputations are reasonabley precise, and that using the imputed data considerably improves out-of-sample predictive performance relative to excluding the imprecise observations. \u2217The authors would like to thank Stefan D\u00f6ring, Hanne Fjelde, Sophia Hatz, Kristian Petrova, David Randahl, Ida Rudolfsen, Eric Skoog, and Nina von Uexkull for helpful comments.

            "abstract": "The most commonly used statistical models of civil war onset fail to correctly predict most occurrences of this rare event in out-of-sample data. Statistical methods for the analysis of binary data, such as logistic regression, even in their rare event and regularized forms, perform poorly at prediction. We compare the performance of Random Forests with three versions of logistic regression (classic logistic regression, Firth rare events logistic regression, and L 1-regularized logistic regression), and find that the algorithmic approach provides significantly more accurate predictions of civil war onset in out-of-sample data than any of the logistic regression models. The article discusses these results and the ways in which algorithmic statistical methods like Random Forests can be useful to more accurately predict rare events in conflict data.",

            "abstract": "This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. These topics are then used in panel regressions to predict the onset of conflict. We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is a good predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when risk in previously peaceful countries arises. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms that make them able to capture the changing context of conflict. At the same time, topics provide width because they are summaries of the full text, including stabilizing factors.",

            "abstract": "Riots, murders, lynchings, and other forms of local violence are costly to security forces and society at large. Identifying risk factors and forecasting where local violence is most likely to occur should help allocate scarce peacekeeping and policing resources. Most forecasting exercises of this kind rely on structural or event data, but these have many limitations in the poorest and most war-torn states, where the need for prediction is arguably most urgent. We adopt an alternative approach, applying machine learning techniques to original panel survey data from Liberia to predict collective, interpersonal, and extrajudicial violence two years into the future. We first train our models to predict 2010 local violence using 2008 risk factors, then generate forecasts for 2012 before collecting new data. Our models achieve out-of-sample AUCs ranging from 0.65 to 0.74, depending on our specification of the dependent variable. The models also draw our attention to risk factors different from those typically emphasized in studies aimed at causal inference alone. For example, we find that while ethnic heterogeneity and polarization are reliable predictors of local violence, adverse economic shocks are not. Surprisingly, we also find that the risk of local violence is higher rather than lower in communities where minority and majority ethnic groups share power. These counter-intuitive results illustrate the usefulness of prediction for generating new stylized facts for future research to explain. Ours is one of just two attempts to forecast local violence using survey data, and we conclude by discussing how our approach can be replicated and extended as similar datasets proliferate.",

            "abstract": "For at least the last two decades, the international community in general and the United Nations specifically have attempted to develop robust, accurate and effective conflict early warning system for conflict prevention. One potential and promising component of integrated early warning systems lies in the field of machine learning. This paper aims at giving conflict analysis a basic understanding of machine learning methodology as well as to test the feasibility and added value of such an approach. The paper finds that the selection of appropriate machine learning methodologies can offer substantial improvements in accuracy and performance. It also finds that even at this early stage in testing machine learning on conflict prediction, full models offer more predictive power than simply using a prior outbreak of violence as the leading indicator of current violence. This suggests that a refined data selection methodology combined with strategic use of machine learning algorithms could indeed offer a significant addition to the early warning toolkit. Finally, the paper suggests a number of steps moving forward to improve upon this initial test methodology.",

In this article, the author examines the relationship between ethnic identity and civil war and points to several empirical instances of fluidity in the behavioral expression of ethnic identities within civil war. The author identifies two processes that are consistent with constructivist theorizing: identity shift and ethnic defection. The author provides several empirical illustrations along with a micro-level test of the determinants of ethnic defection. At the micro level, ethnic defection is best predicted by the extent of territorial control exercised by the incumbent political actor and the level of prior insurgent violence. The author also hypothesizes that at the macro level, ethnic defection is a function of the resources available to incumbent actors and conclude by stressing the need to take seriously the endogenous dynamics of civil wars.",

Results show that Africa has had a similar incidence of civil conflict to other developing regions, and, with minor exceptions, its conflicts are consistent with the global pattern of behavior. However, the structure of risk differs considerably from other regions. Africa's economic characteristics have made it more vulnerable to conflict, but this has been offset by social characteristics that make its societies atypically safe. The contrasting trends of conflict are analyzed: rising in Africa and declining in other regions. Results show that these trends are predicted by the model. Africa's rising trend of conflict is due to its atypically poor economic performance.",

            "abstract": "We address a well-known but infrequently discussed problem in the quantitative study of international conflict: Despite immense data collections, prestigious journals, and sophisticated analyses, empirical findings in the literature on international conflict are often unsatisfying. Many statistical results change from article to article and specification to specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistent. In this article we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem: The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large, stable, and replicable wherever the ex ante probability of conflict is large. This simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array of observable implications, all consistent with the literature. We directly test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that includes its critical features. Our approach, a version of a \u201cneural network\u201d model, uncovers some interesting structural features of international conflict and, as one evaluative measure, forecasts substantially better than any previous effort. Moreover, this improvement comes at little cost, and it is easy to evaluate whether the model is a statistical improvement over the simpler models commonly used.",

            "abstract": "The authors investigate whether civil wars have economic causes. The model is based on utility theory, rebels will conduct a civil war if the perceived benefits outweigh the costs of rebellion. Using probit and tobit models, the propositions are tested empirically. Four variables, initial income, ethno-linguistic fractionalization, the amount of natural resources, and initial population size are significant and strong determinants of the duration and the probability of civil wars. One important finding is that the relationship between civil wars and ethnic diversity is nonmonotonic; highly fractionalized societies have no greater risk of experiencing a civil war than homogenous ones.

            "abstract": "Many scholars have detected a decrease of political violence, but the causes of this decline remain unclear. As a contribution to this debate, we revisit the controversy over trends in conflict after the end of the Cold War. While many made ominous predictions of surging ethnic warfare, Gurr presented evidence of a pacifying trend since the mid-1990s and predicted a further decline in ethnic conflict in an article on \u2018the waning of ethnic war\u2019. Leveraging more recent data on ethnic groups and their participation in ethnic civil wars, this study evaluates if Gurr was right about the decline of ethnic conflict, and if he was right for the right reasons. We assess whether an increase in governments\u2019 accommodative policies toward ethnic groups can plausibly account for a decline in ethnic civil war. Our findings lend considerable support to an account of the pacifying trend that stresses the granting of group rights, regional autonomy, and inclusion in power-sharing, as well as democratization and peacekeeping.",

We assess to what extent information about the characteristics of the conflicting dyads and conflict history can be evaluated ex ante and improve our ability to predict when conflicts will see mediation as well as when peaceful solutions are more likely to follow from mediation. We justify that the information used to generate predictions through the model can be assessed ex ante, using the ongoing conflict in Syria as an example. Our results suggest that a two-stage model of mediation and success seems to do relatively well overall in predicting when mediation is likely to occur, but notably less well in predicting the outcome of mediation. This may reflect how ex ante observable structural characteristics are likely to influence willingness to mediate, while the outcome of mediation to a large extent will be influenced by unobservable characteristics or private information and how these are influenced by mediation. We discuss the usefulness of out-of-sample evaluation in studying conflict management and suggest future directions for improving our ability to forecast mediation.",

            "abstract": "The impact of inequality on the outbreak of intrastate armed conflicts or civil wars has recently attracted considerable interest in conflict research. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on inequality in the total population (vertical inequality), recent studies have analysed inequality between certain groups of people (horizontal inequality), and found that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of conflict onset. However, most of the recent studies on the inequality\u2013conflict nexus have focused on conflicts fought between ethnic groups. The relation between inequality and other (non-ethnic) categories of conflicts has attracted less attention. The present study aims to address this gap: it implements a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relation between inequality and popular rebellions, a subset of conflicts where mobilization transcends ethnic boundaries and hostilities involve popular participation. Based on a sample of 77 popular rebellions and new global data on vertical inequality in income and education, this study shows that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of popular rebellion onset. In addition, the study reveals that inequality proxies (income and education Gini indices) outperform proxies of the absolute level of income (GDP per capita) in the model of popular rebellion onset, suggesting that it is relative, not absolute, well-being that ultimately motivates people to rise up in arms.",

            "abstract": "Developing political forecasting models not only increases the ability of political scientists to inform public policy decisions, but is also relevant for scientific advancement. This article argues for and demonstrates the utility of creating forecasting models for predicting political conflicts in a diverse range of country settings. Apart from the benefit of making actual predictions, we argue that predictive heuristics are one gold standard of model development in the field of conflict studies. As such, they shed light on an array of important components of the political science literature on conflict dynamics. We develop and present conflict predictions that have been highly accurate for past and subsequent events, exhibiting few false-negative and false-positive categorizations. Our predictions are made at the monthly level for 6-month periods into the future, taking into account the social\u2013spatial context of each individual country. The model has a high degree of accuracy in reproducing historical data measured monthly over the past 10 years and has approximately equal accuracy in making forecasts. Thus, forecasting in political science is increasingly accurate. At the same time, by providing a gold standard that separates model construction from model evaluation, we can defeat observational research designs and use true prediction as a way to evaluate theories. We suggest that progress in the modeling of conflict research depends on the use of prediction as a gold standard of heuristic evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Drawing on the literatures on elite transitions, factionalism and the new institutionalism, this paper hypothesizes that the stability of partially democratic and emerging democratic regimes is dependent on the willingness of elites to make credible commitments to cooperate and comply with democratic rules. That willingness (or lack thereof) can be signaled by the presence of cooperative or conflict-precipitating events and actions in the periods around elections. We identify and analyze a variety of intra-elite interactions and demonstrate that conflict-precipitating events significantly increase the odds of a democratic retreat in the months before or just after an election, while cooperative events can balance them and prevent retreat. Using event data collected from 40 low- and middle-income countries for two-year periods around national elections between 1991 and 2007 we show that the imbalance of conflict-precipitating over cooperative events is far greater in cases of retreat from democracy. Furthermore, international intervention and pressure had a negative relationship with democratic stability. A logistic regression model accurately identified democratic retreat in 79 percent of the cases examined. Factor analysis revealed several common patterns of intra-elite conflict that can lead to democratic retreat, or conversely, patterns of cooperative events that bolster democratic consolidation. Finally, the data strongly argues for a model of democratic development that depends on open-ended elite maneuvering and the emergence of elite agree- ments, rather than a model where strong prior institutional constraints determine elite actions.",

            "abstract": "Prediction is an important goal in the study of international conflict, but a large body of research has found that existing statistical models generally have disappointing predictive abilities. We show that most efforts build on models unlikely to be helpful for prediction. Many models essentially ignore the origins of conflict; studies look either at invariant structural features believed to affect the opportunities of conflict, or at factors that are believed to reduce the baseline risk of conflict, without attempting to identify the potential motivations and contentious issues over which conflicts typically arise. Researchers that have considered how contentious issues may motivate conflict and how these can be managed, using the Issues Correlates of War (ICOW) data, have not considered how these features may inform prediction. We assess the risk of dyadic interstate conflict based on the presence of specific contentious issues and conflict management events that may change the conflict potential of these contentious issues. We evaluate to what extent incorporating contentious issues and conflict management can help improve out-of-sample forecasting, as well as advance our understanding of conflict dynamics. Our results provide strong support for the idea that taking into account contentious issues can inform and improve out-of-sample forecasting.",

            "abstract": "THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS DECLINED. Steven Pinker, Penguin, New York, NY 2011. ISBN 978-0-670-02295-3.There's been a shooting in a Sikh Temple this morning. A lone gunman entered a Colorado theater and opened fire. Syrians are now engaged in civil war. Faced with daily news stories of death and destruction, it is easy to believe that things are getting worse. Not so, explains Harvard psychologist, Steven Pinker in his new work, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined.Pinker combines in-depth historical research with rigorous psychological research to argue the case for a decline in global violence. As Pinker aptly points out, many people look at our age as one of unprecedented violence and terror to be viewed with pessimism. Drawing on historical analysis, psychological research and findings from related sciences such as anthropology, sociology, and economics Pinker argues that the data paint a very different picture. In the first chapter, Pinker takes the reader on a quick journey through the history of the world pointing out that the ancient and medieval worlds were very different than the world we live in today. Numerous prehistoric skeletons bear evidence of very violent deaths. Ancient people destroyed entire tribes. Romans carried out violent executions. Medieval Knights led lies of violence and other Europeans meted out horrendous punishments for acts which might not even be judged worthy of condemnation in today's democracies. Finally, the early 20th century saw two World Wars before the long peace ensued. In light of that history, Pinker argues that perhaps we should reconsider our assumptions about our own world.In the first section of the book, Pinker identifies six historical trends which could have led to declines in violence. The first trend he calls the Pacification Process by which people gave up nomadic hunting and gathering lives for lives of agriculture in cities. Competition and anarchy in the prehistoric world made violence necessary for survival. The development of agriculture called for greater cooperation between individuals and the formation of governments to impose order created a world where violence was not always in one's best interest. Statistical analysis supports the idea that the emergence of states lead to a decline in violence. The second trend, the Civilizing Process, is an idea he developed from the work of Norbert Elias. In the late medieval and early modern periods, etiquette and social norms began to be important in social interactions, economics and technology began to advance, and governments began to become more centralized. This trend was also accompanied by a decline in violence. The third trend is the Humanitarian Revolution during which people began to increasingly find practices, such as torture, capital punishment, war and slavery, morally questionable. Empathy, compassion, and peace became important characteristics. The fourth trend is the Long Peace, which stems from the realization that since World War II no two major world powers have gone to war and, in spite of predictions to the contrary, nuclear weapons have never been used. \u2026",

            "abstract": "We offer the first independent scholarly evaluation of the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences of the State Failure Task Force and their efforts to forecast when states will fail. State failure refers to the collapse of the authority of the central government to impose order, as in civil wars, revolutionary wars, genocides, politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions. This task force, set up at the behest of Vice President Gore in 1994, has been led by a group of distinguished academics working as consultants to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. State Failure Task Force reports and publications have received attention in the media, in academia, and from public policy decision-makers. In this article, we identify several methodological errors in the task force work that cause their reported forecast probabilities of conflict to be too large, their causal inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and their claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated. However, we also find that the task force has amassed the best and most carefully collected data on state failure in existence, and the required corrections which we provide, although very large in effect, are easy to implement. We also reanalyze their data with better statistical procedures and demonstrate how to improve forecasting performance to levels significantly greater than even corrected versions of their models. Although still a highly uncertain endeavor, we are as a consequence able to offer the first accurate forecasts of state failure, along with procedures and results that may be of practical use in informing foreign policy decision making. We also describe a number of strong empirical regularities that may help in ascertaining the causes of state failure.",

            "title": "Forecasting Political Conict in Asia and the Middle East using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Models",
            "abstract": "Latent Dirichlet allocation models are a relatively new computational classification algorithm. In its standard application to document classification, the model assumes each document to be composed of a mixture of multiple, overlapping topics each with a typical set of words, and classification is done by associating words in a document with the latent topics most likely to have generated the observed distribution of those words. I apply this technique to the problem of political forecasting by assuming that the stream of events observed between a dyad of actors is a mixture of a variety of different political strategies and standard operating procedures (for example escalation of repressive measures against a minority group while simultaneously making efforts to co-opt the elites of that group). By identifying the dominant strategies being pursued at time t, one gets information that can be used to forecast likely patterns of interaction at a later time t + k. This approach is applied to event data generated for 29 Asian countries in the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System project for 1998-2010 to forecast the ICEWS conflict measures for rebellion, insurgency, ethno-religious violence, domestic political conflict and international conflict at a six month lead time, and to the Israel-Palestine and Israel-Lebanon dyads from the KEDS Levant data set for 1979-2009. In random samples balancing the occurrence of negative and positive outcomes on the dependent variable, LDA combined with a logistic model predicts with around 60% to 70% accuracy in in-sample evaluation in both data sets, and improves very substantially on the sensitivity of the classification compared with simple logistic models in full samples. A supervised version of LDA, however, does not provide much improvement over the unsupervised version, and shows some pathological behaviors. Some structure can be found in the factors, though more work is needed on this.",

This article advances a critique of this positivist climate conflict research programme, identifying within it three serial shortcomings. It contends, first, that the correlations identified by this research are specious, since they always rest upon coding and causal assumptions which range from the arbitrary to the untenable. It argues, second, that even if the correlations identified within this research were significant and meaningful, they would still not constitute a sound basis for making predictions about the conflict impacts of climate change. And it submits, third, that this research programme reflects and reproduces an ensemble of Northern stereotypes, ideologies and policy agendas. A departure from positivist method is required, the article contends, if we are to get close to thinking through the wide-ranging political and conflict implications of the human transformation of the global climate.",

How are patterns of social identification shaped by conflict? We draw on empirical results regarding the nature and determinants of group identification to develop a simple model that addresses these questions. The model highlights the possibility of vicious and virtuous cycles where conflict and identification patterns reinforce each other. It also shows how processes of ethnic identification amplify the importance of political institutions and traces the effects of national status and perceived differences across ethnic groups. Finally, we demonstrate how a small but sufficiently potent group of ethnic radicals can derail a peaceful equilibrium, leading to the polarization of the entire population. We reexamine several historical cases as well as empirical correlates of civil wars in light of these results.",

To this end, published results indicate that the impacts of climate change are significant, however, with a wide projected range (between 5 million and 170 million additional people at risk of hunger by 2080) strongly depending on assumed socio-economic development. The likely impacts of climate change on the other important dimensions of food security are discussed qualitatively, indicating the potential for further negative impacts beyond those currently assessed with models. Finally, strengths and weaknesses of current assessment studies are discussed, suggesting improvements and proposing avenues for new analyses.",

The capability of a country (a.k.a. its national strength) is largest at its home base and declines as the nation moves away. Capable states are relatively less impeded by distance and can therefore influence more distant regions. Given armed conflict, battles are expected to occur in areas where the projected powers of the antagonists are comparable. When the aggressor\u2019s projected power is greater than the national strength of the defender, the latter side should give in without violence. This paper is a first attempt to apply Boulding\u2019s theory of international power projection to the study of civil war. Using new data on the point location of conflict onset and a variety of measures of state and rebel strength, this paper tests empirically one corollary of the LSG model: that civil wars in general locate further away from the capital in more powerful regimes.",

We construct and analyze a new dataset of geo-referenced politically relevant ethnic groups, covering the entire world during the period from 1951 through 2005. Our results show that the conflict probability of marginalized groups increases with the demographic power balance compared to the group(s) in power. Furthermore, the risk of conflict increases with the distance from the group to the capital, and the roughness of the terrain in the group's settlement area. We also find that while the results for demographic group strength hold for all ethnic civil wars, the geographic factors apply for territorial ethnic conflicts only.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative scholarship on civil wars has long debated whether ethnic diversity breeds armed conflict. We go beyond this debate and show that highly diverse societies are not more conflict prone. Rather, states characterized by certain ethnopolitical configurations of power are more likely to experience violent conflict. First, armed rebellions are more likely to challenge states that exclude large portions of the population on the basis of ethnic background. Second, when a large number of competing elites share power in a segmented state, the risk of violent infighting increases. Third, incohesive states with a short history of direct rule are more likely to experience secessionist conflicts. We test these hypotheses for all independent states since 1945 using the new Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) data set. Cross-national analysis demonstrates that ethnic politics is as powerful and robust in predicting civil wars as is a country's level of economic development. Using multinomial logit regression, we show that rebellion, infighting, and secession result from high degrees of exclusion, segmentation, and incohesion, respectively. More diverse states, on the other hand, are not more likely to suffer from violent conflict.",

            "abstract": "To explain the distribution of civil wars, guerrilla warfare, and revolutionary outbreaks, the literature on modern political violence has shifted, broadly speaking, from a modernization perspective that emphasized the role of material conflict and of grievances to a more recent research program that stresses the geographical and organizational opportunities that insurgents may have to engage in violence. Drawing on those lines of inquiry equally, this article offers an integrated analytical model that considers both the motives and the opportunities of states and rebels. Civil wars, guerrillas, and revolutionary outbreaks are seen as a result of the nature and distribution of wealth in each country. Systematic and organized violent conflicts are most likely in economies where inequality is high and wealth is mostly immobile, that is, in societies where those worse off would benefit substantially from expropriating all assets. Violence is conditional on the mobilizational and organizational capacity of challengers and on the state capacity to control its territory. The theory is tested on data on civil wars from 1850 to 1999 for the whole world and on data on guerrilla warfare and revolutionary episodes spanning the years from 1919 to 1997 across all countries.",

            "abstract": "Ethnic groups and conflicts often transcend country borders, indicating that notions of relative strength and resolve may also surpass such borders. This study focuses on the association between ethnic polarization and conflict in a widened strategic environment, encapsulating each state that experiences ethnic conflict and its neighboring states, and involving contagion processes. Two claims are presented. First, when a state experiences ethnic conflict, neighboring states that are ethnically polarized are more likely to also experience ethnic conflict. Second, when a group involved in ethnic conflict has a kinship tie to a group in a neighboring state, the latter group is increasingly likely to be inspired to challenge the government and end up in ethnic conflict. This should be especially likely if the group resides in a state characterized by ethnic polarization. To evaluate these claims, this article employs logit regression on a global dataset covering the period from 1989 to 2004. The empirical analysis supports the first claim; polarized states are indeed associated with an increased likelihood of contagion processes. The findings also demonstrate that kinship links make contagion more likely; however, this effect is not conditioned by the level of ethnic polarization. The results are robust to a series of alternative specifications. In conclusion, these findings point to the importance of incorporating a widened strategic setting in the analysis when examining the association between ethnic polarization and civil conflict.",

The results of the analysis suggest, first, that the factors that predict antistate activity at one level of violence do not always hold at other levels; second, the response by the state has a large impact on the subsequent behavior of the rebels; and third, the popular notion of diamonds fueling civil unrest is generally not supported.

            "abstract": "This article draws on a comparative case study design to refine formal-quantitative models of civil war, expanding them to highlight political processes that lead to civil war. It uses 21 case studies of civil war onset and avoidance to show the shortcomings in prominent rationalist models of civil war that rely heavily on economic variables. These shortcomings include measurement error, unit heterogeneity, model misspecification, and lack of clarity about causal mechanisms. Additionally, the greed/grievance distinction that underlies the economic models is misguided. This article analyzes civil war not as a discrete phenomenon, but rather as one phase in a cycle of violence. Economic models of civil war, however, rely on theories that cannot distinguish effectively between civil war and other forms of political violence. To explain civil war, we must explain why various and often conflicting micro-level motives combine to produce political violence with the characteristics that we attribute to civil war. If we cannot understand why we get civil war instead of other forms of organized political violence, then we do not understand civil war.Nicholas Sambanis thanks Keith Darden, Anna Grzymala-Busse, Jennifer Hochschild, Stathis Kalyvas, Bruce Russett, Jack Snyder, Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, and seminar participants at New York University and the University of Chicago for very useful comments, as well as Annalisa Zinn and Steve Shewfelt for excellent research assistance.

Three approaches have been used t o explain the inconsistent findings of the EI-PC (Economic Inequality-Political Conflict) nexus: statistical modeling, formal modeling, and theory building. Because analysts have tended to possess different research skills, these three approaches have been employed in isolation from one another. Singly, however, all three approaches have proved deficient and are unlikely to solve the EI-PC puzzle. The most fruitful approach is to combine the assumptions of the theory builders and the deductive approach of the formal modelers with the various empirical tests of the statistical modelers. Such an approach to the EI-PC puzzle produces a crucial test of the Deprived Actor and Rational Actor theories of conflict. The approach is also our best hope for solving the other long-standing puzzles in conflict studies.",

            "abstract": "Maldistribution of land in agrarian societies is commonly thought to be an important precondition of mass political violence and revolution. Others argue that because of the difficulty of mobilizing rural populations for political protest, land maldistribution is irrelevant except as part of an inegalitarian distribution of income nationwide. These rival inequality hypotheses have significant implications with respect to the kinds of reforms likely to reduce the potential for insurgency in a society. They are tested using the most comprehensive cross-national compilation of data currently available on land inequality, landlessness, and income inequality. Support is found for the argument that attributes the greater causal import to income inequality. Moreover, the effect of income inequality on political violence is found to hold in the context of a causal model that takes into account the repressiveness of the regime, governmental acts of coercion, intensity of separatism, and level of economic development.",

            "abstract": "Potential for political violence is defined by a summated scale built from two cumulative scales measuring approval of and readiness to engage in behaviors which constitute progressively greater challenge to a political regime. A prevalent explanation of potential for political violence proposes that the major direct antecedent is relative deprivation. The partial theory proposed here does not assign a central role to relative deprivation; rather, diffuse support for the political authority structure, and belief that political violence has led to goal attainment in the past, are proposed as major direct antecedents. Relative deprivation is denned by position on the Cantril Self-Anchoring scale with respect to three welfare values. The measure of diffuse affect for the political authority structure is a weighted summation of items measuring the degree to which political authorities are believed to wield power honestly, benevolently, and justly. Belief that political violence has led to goal attainment is denned as a summation of items measuring the degree to which the use of political violence by dissident groups is thought to have been helpful. The data base is a sample of a population in which instances of political violence have been frequent in the past. A linear additive model of Potential for Political Violence, with Trust in Political Authorities and Efficacy of Past Violence as describing variables, shows an accuracy of prediction which is satisfactory and superior to that yielded by a multiplicative model.",

            "abstract": "There is an ongoing discussion especially among political scientists and economists whether and how climate variability affects civil conflicts and wars in developing countries. Given the predicted climatic changes, several studies argue that increasing temperatures or decreasing precipitation will lead to more conflicts in the future. This paper aims at linking the different strands of the literature by analyzing the causal mechanisms at work. We use short-term weather variability as well as long-term changes in Sub-Saharan Africa and find that climate (change) significantly affects agricultural output, to some extent also GDP, and has no robust direct effects on civil wars. Negative shocks in GDP, however, have the expected fostering effects on civil conflicts.",

            "abstract": "Dominant climate models suggest that large parts of Africa will experience greater climatic variability and increasing rates of drought in coming decades. This could have severe societal consequences, because the economies and food supplies of most African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture. According to leading environmental security scholars, policymakers, and nongovernmental organizations, an increase in scarcity-driven armed conflicts should also be expected. A conditional theory of environmental conflict predicts that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. However, an empirical evaluation of this general proposition through a unique gridded dataset of postcolonial Africa, which combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethnopolitical context, shows little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.",

            "title": "African range wars: Climate, conflict, and property rights",
            "abstract": "This article examines the effect of climate change on a type of armed conflict that pits pastoralists (cattle herders) against each other (range wars). Such conflicts are typically fought over water rights and/or grazing rights to unfenced/unowned land. The state is rarely involved directly. The rangeland of East Africa is a region particularly vulnerable to drought and livestock diseases associated with climate change. To analyze the possible effects of climate change on pastoral conflict, we focus our analysis on changes in resource availability, contrasting cases of abundance and scarcity. The role of resources is further contextualized by competing notions of property rights, and the role of the state in defining property and associated rights. We employ a contest success function (CSF) game-theoretic model to analyze the logic of range wars. This CSF approach emphasizes the low-level, non-binary nature of raiding behavior between pastoralist groups over limited natural resources. A central contribution of this approach is that the logic of raiding behavior implies a positive relationship between resources and conflict. This positive relationship is supported by several studies of the rangeland of East Africa, but is generally dismissed by the literature on the \u2018resource curse\u2019. This relationship is contingent on other factors examined in the model, producing the following results. First, the level of property rights protection provided by the state generally reduces conflict between pastoralist groups. Second, if property rights protection is provided in a biased manner, then conflict between pastoralist groups increases. Third, severe resource asymmetries between two pastoralist groups will induce the poorer group to become bandits (focusing their efforts on raiding and not producing), while the richer group raids in retaliation.",

            "abstract": "Global warming is expected to make the climate warmer, wetter, and wilder. It is predicted that such climate change will increase the severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods, surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards. However, our results suggest \u2013 based on historical data \u2013 that more frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.",

We hypothesize that the risk of violence is affected by the \u201cgain-loss\u201d utility of game outcomes around a rationally expected reference point. Our empirical analysis uses police reports of violent incidents on Sundays during the professional football season. Controlling for the pregame point spread and the size of the local viewing audience, we find that upset losses (defeats when the home team was predicted to win by four or more points) lead to a 10% increase in the rate of at-home violence by men against their wives and girlfriends. In contrast, losses when the game was expected to be close have small and insignificant effects. Upset wins (victories when the home team was predicted to lose) also have little impact on violence, consistent with asymmetry in the gain-loss utility function. The rise in violence after an upset loss is concentrated in a narrow time window near the end of the game and is larger for more important games. We find no evidence for reference point updating based on the halftime score.",

            "abstract": "This article revisits the relationship between income per capita and civil conflict. We begin by documenting that the empirical literature identifies two different patterns. First, poor countries have a higher propensity to suffer from civil war. Second, civil war occurs when countries suffer negative income shocks. In a formal model we examine an explanation often suggested in the informal literature: civil wars occur in poor countries because the opportunity cost of fighting is small. We show that while this explanation fails to make sense of the first empirical pattern, it provides a coherent theoretical basis for the second. We then enrich the model to allow for private imperfect information about the state of the economy and show that mutual fears exacerbate the problem caused by negative income shocks.",

Controlling for holidays, school closings, time of day, day of the week, season of the year, and their interactions, moderator-variable autoregression analyses indicated that assaults were an inverted U-shaped function of temperature. Replicating past research, the curvilinear relationship was dominant during daylight hours and spring months, whereas linear relationships were observed during nighttime hours and other seasons.

            "abstract": "Conflict over scarce resources, such as minerals, fish, water, and particularly territory, is a traditional source of armed struggle. Recently, wideranging claims have been made to the effect that environmental degradation will increase resource scarcity and therefore contribute to an increase in armed conflict. So far, there has been much controversy and little relevant systematic study of this phenomenon. Most scholarship on the relationship between resources, the environment, and armed conflict suffers from one or more of the following problems: (1) there is a lack of clarity over what is meant by `environmental conflict'; (2) researchers engage in definitional and polemical exercises rather than analysis; (3) important variables are neglected, notably political and economic factors which have a strong influence on conflict and mediate the influence of resource and environmental factors; (4) some models become so large and complex that they are virtually untestable; (5) cases are selected on values of the dependent variable; (6) the causality of the relationship is reversed; (7) postulated events in the future are cited as empirical evidence; (8) studies fail to distinguish between foreign and domestic conflict; and (9) confusion reigns about the appropriate level of analysis. While no publications are characterized by all of these problems, many have several of them. This article identifies a few lights in the wilderness and briefly outlines a program of research.",

            "abstract": "We offer a simple general equilibrium model to analyze how economy-wide forces (i.e. shocks to terms of trade, technology and endowments) will affect the intensity of social conflict over the distribution of resources. Examples of conflict activities range from crime to civil war. We show that not all favorable shocks to an economy will reduce conflict, even when they could make society richer. Rather, positive shocks to labor intensive industries will raise wages and diminish social conflict, while positive shocks to capital intensive industries will do just the opposite. The key requirement is that the appropriation activity be more labor intensive than the average of the productive industries. Our model can account for the curse of natural resources, it explains why aid in kind to war ridden societies may have perverse effects, and how international trade policy should be debated if civil conflict in poorer countries is a concern. Including appropriation activities into a canonic general equilibrium model introduces a social constraint to policy analysis. Thus, we can also account for \"optimal populist\" policies, and \"national development\" strategies (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)

Our main focus is on a set of development indicators that capture seven of the Millennium Development Goals, but the author also look briefly into the effect of conflict and fragility on growth, human rights abuses, and democratization. The author analyze these relationships using a variety of methods, averages by conflict and fragility status; cross-sectional regression analyses of change in each indicator over the time frame for which we have data; fixed-effects regression analyses of the impact on each indicator for each five-year period 1965-2009; as well as occasional panel time series models and matching techniques. In section two, the author summarizes the methodological choices and presents our conflict data. Section three summarizes the results of our analysis. Finally, section four analyzes the effects of internal armed conflict on the attainment of the individual Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).",

            "abstract": "Existing research has related civil war primarily to country-specific factors or processes that take place within individual states experiencing conflict. Many contemporary civil wars, however, display a transnational character, where actors, resources, and events span national boundaries. This article challenges the 'closed polity' approach to the study of civil war, where individual states are treated as independent entities, and posits that transnational factors and linkages between states can exert strong influences on the risk of violent civil conflict. Previous research has shown that conflicts in a state's regional context can increase the risk of conflict, but the research has not distinguished between different varieties of transnational linkages that may underlie geographic contagion, and it has failed to consider the potential influences of domestic attributes. The article develops and evaluates a series of hypotheses on how transnational factors can influence the risk of conflict and the prospects for maintaining peace in a conditional autologistic model, including country-specific factors often associated with civil wars. The results suggest that transnational linkages between states and regional factors strongly influence the risk of civil conflict. This, in turn, implies that the risk of civil war is not determined just by a country's internal or domestic characteristics, but differs fundamentally, depending on a country's linkages to other states.",

            "title": "A Clash of Generations? Youth Bulges and Political Violence",
            "abstract": "It has frequently been suggested that exceptionally large youth cohorts, the so-called \u201cyouth bulges,\u201d make countries more susceptible to political violence. Within two prominent theoretical frameworks in the study of civil war, youth bulges are argued to potentially increase both opportunities and motives for political violence. This claim is empirically tested in a time-series cross-national statistical model for internal armed conflict for the period 1950\u20132000, and for event data for terrorism and rioting for the years 1984\u20131995. The expectation that youth bulges should increase the risk of political violence receives robust support for all three forms of violence. The results are consistent both with an expectation that youth bulges provide greater opportunities for violence through the abundant supply of youths with low opportunity costs, and with an expectation that stronger motives for violence may arise as youth bulges are more likely to experience institutional crowding, in particular unemployment. Some contextual factors have been suggested to potentially enhance the effect of youth bulges. In an empirical test of these propositions, the study suggests that youth bulges are particularly associated with an increasing risk of internal armed conflict in starkly autocratic regimes, but a similar effect is also found for highly democratic countries. The interaction of youth bulges with economic decline and expansion in higher education appear to increase the risk of terrorism but not of rioting. Recent studies in economic demography find that when fertility is sharply decreasing, causing lower dependency ratios, large youth cohorts entering the labor market may lead to economic boosts. This study finds some empirical evidence complementing these results, indicating that the effect of youth bulges on political violence may decline along with reduced dependency ratios.",

            "abstract": "The burgeoning literature on civil conflicts seldom considers why some civil wars are so much deadlier than others. This article investigates that question using a new data set of the number of combat deaths in internal conflicts from 1946 to 2002. The first section presents descriptive statistics on battle deaths by era, conflict type, and region. The article then tests state strength, regime type, and cultural characteristics as predictors of the number of combat deaths in civil war. The determinants of conflict severity seem to be quite different from those for conflict onset. Democracy, rather than economic development or state military strength, is most strongly correlated with fewer deaths; wars have also been less deadly on average since the end of the cold war. Religious heterogeneity does not explain the military severity of internal violence, and surprisingly, ethnic homogeneity may be related to more deadly conflicts.",

            "title": "Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer than Others?",
            "abstract": "Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have anti-colonial wars. By contrast, \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 wars that typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group are on average quite long-lived. So are conflicts in which a rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium, diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to long-running, destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible explanation. In the model, regional autonomy deals may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine the government\u2019s ability to commit. The commitment problem binds harder when the center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as in the case of contraband funding.",

            "abstract": "While climate change scenarios for the Sahel vary and are uncertain, the most popularized prediction says there will progressively be drier conditions with more erratic rainfall. According to some, an increase in violent conflicts over scarce resources should also be expected. This article investigates the climate\u2013conflict nexus in detail, focusing on a distinct area at the heart of the Sahel, the inland delta of the Niger river in the Mopti region of Mali. Two complementary analytical approaches are applied. The first consists of collection and analysis of court data on land-use conflicts, 1992\u20132009, from the regional Court of Appeal in Mopti. A comparison of the conflict data with statistics on contemporaneous climatic conditions gives little substance to claims that climate variability is an important driver of these conflicts. Second, we carried out a qualitative analysis of one of the many land-use conflicts in the region. Again, we find that factors other than those directly related to environmental conditions and resource scarcity dominate as plausible explanations of the violent conflict. We argue that three structural factors are the main drivers behind these conflicts: agricultural encroachment that obstructed the mobility of herders and livestock, opportunistic behavior of rural actors as a consequence of an increasing political vacuum, and corruption and rent seeking among government officials.",

            "abstract": "The second Chechen war, starting in the North Caucasus in August 1999, shows few signs of a ceasefire after eleven years, although the level of violence has declined from the peaks of the war's first two years. Initially framed by both sides as a war of separatists versus the federal center, the situation is now complicated by the installation of a Moscow ally into power in Chechnya and by the splintering of the opposition into groups with diverse aims and theaters of operation. The main rebel movement has declared the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in all the Muslim republics of the North Caucasus as its ultimate goal. Fears of regional destabilization of the entire North Caucasus of Russia are propelled by reports of increased militant activism in republics adjoining Chechnya due to possible contagion effects of violence in these poor areas. Temporal and spatial descriptive statistics of a large database of 14,177 violent events, geocoded by precise location, from August 1999 to August 2007, provide evidence of the conflict's diffusion into the republics bordering Chechnya. \u201cHot spots\u201d of violence are identified using Kulldorff's SaTScan statistics. A geographically weighted regression predictive model of violence indicates that locations in Chechnya and forested areas have more violence, whereas areas with high Russian populations and communities geographically removed from the main federal highway through the region see less violence.",

            "abstract": "Dominant climate models suggest that large parts of Africa will experience greater climatic variability and increasing rates of drought in coming decades. This could have severe societal consequences as the economies and food supplies of most African countries depend on rain-fed agriculture. According to leading environmental security scholars, policy makers, and NGOs, an increase in scarcity-driven armed conflicts should also be expected. Drawing on these arguments, we present a conditional theory of environmental conflict predicting that drought increases the risk of civil war primarily when it strikes vulnerable and politically marginalized populations in agrarian societies. This general proposition is evaluated empirically through a unique gridded dataset of post-colonial Africa that combines high-resolution meteorological data with georeferenced data on civil war onset and the local ethno-political context. Despite popular conception, we find little evidence of a drought-conflict connection. Instead, the local risk of civil war can be explained by sociopolitical and geographic factors: a politically marginalized population, high infant mortality, proximity to international borders, and high local population density.

We introduce the idea of an autologistic model where the response for one observation is dependent on the value of the response among adjacent observations. The autologistic model has likelihood function that is mathematically intractable, since the observations are conditionally dependent upon one another. We review alternative techniques for estimating this model, with special emphasis on recent advances using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We evaluate a highly simplified autologistic model of conflict where the likelihood of war involvement for each nation is conditional on the war involvement of proximate states. We estimate this autologistic model for a single year (1988) via maximum pseudolikelihood and MCMC maximum likelihood methods. Our results indicate that the autologistic model fits the data much better than an unconditional model and that the MCMC estimates generally dominate the pseudolikelihood estimates. The autologistic model generates predicted probabilities greater than 0.5 and has relatively good predictive abilities in an out-of-sample forecast for the subsequent decade (1989 to 1998), correctly identifying not only ongoing conflicts, but also new ones.",

This article takes issue with the `deterministic' view that climate change and resultant resource scarcities will have a direct impact on political violence. Rather, the effect of climate change on armed conflict is contingent on a number of political and social variables, which, if ignored by analysts, can lead to poor predictions about when and where conflict is likely. This article then discusses ways to improve research on the climate change\u2014conflict connection and outlines broad policy suggestions for dealing with this potential problem. Scholars must communicate their findings with the policy community in order to come up with prudent solutions to this problem, while countering unnecessary rhetoric on both sides of the debate.",

            "abstract": "\"While the marked decrease in population growth in many countries and regions is good news for those concerned about global population, it offers no clear relief for concerns about the security implications of population change.\" As we cross into the new century, the world seems finally to have turned the corner on population growth. A combination of increased education for women, national and international support for policies of population planning and the spread of economic development and accompanying movement along the demographic transition frontier have led to falling population growth rates around the world. Whether among the behemoths--China and India--or among the smaller but rapidly growing nations--such as Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Malawi--population growth rates have dropped dramatically in the last decade. (1) Yet while population growth rates have dropped around the world, they remain high in some areas. In particular, many nations in the Middle East, southeast Asia and central and northern Africa still are growing at nearly 3 percent per year, a growth rate that leads to a doubling of population in approximately 25 years. Moreover, although in most countries the rate of population growth has slowed, the absolute number of people being added to the world's population has not; the large number of women of childbearing age in the developing world, carrying the momentum of past population growth, ensure that even while growth rates fall as a percentage of the existing population, the number of new births each year continues to rise. For example, although China's growth rate has fallen to 1.0 percent per year, China will still grow by 10 to 11 million people per year for the next 15 years. The world as a whole will add roughly 80 million people per year, or another 960 million (that is, another India) in the next dozen years. (2) DEMOGRAPHY AND SECURITY: KEY FINDINGS After nearly three decades of debate and analysis, stemming from Myron Weiner's (1971) path-breaking study, scholars are beginning to develop much clearer answers to the complex questions regarding how population changes affect security concerns. Those answers can be summarized briefly in the following propositions, each of which we shall treat in greater detail below: 1) While population growth often brings degradation of forests, water resources, arable land and other local resources, such environmental degradation is not a major or pervasive cause of international wars, ethnic wars or revolutionary conflicts. Such degradation often brings misery, yet such misery does not generally trigger the elite alienation and opposition to the government necessary for large-scale violence to occur. 2) Population growth can give rise to conflicts over increasingly scarce resources, such as farmland, if those conflicts involve elites seeking to take resources from popular groups, or competition between elite factions for control of those resources. However, what determines whether violent conflict arises are the relationships among popular groups, elites and the state, and particularly whether the state has the capacity to channel and moderate elite conflicts. Only where elite conflicts or popular resistance to elite actions overwhelm weak states do major conflicts arise. 3) While overall population growth and population density do not generally predict political risks, a number of distinct kinds of demographic changes--rapid growth in the labor force in slow-growing economies, a rapid increase in educated youth aspiring to elite positions when such positions are scarce, unequal population growth rates between different ethnic groups, urbanization that exceeds employment growth and migrations that change the local balance among major ethnic groups--do appear to increase the risks of violent internal political and ethnic conflicts. In addition, there is some evidence that countries with larger populations have greater risks of both armed conflict and state repression. \u2026",

            "abstract": "This article argues that ethnic problems are only one aspect of political violence in Africa, while violent conflicts must be considered a failure of the state to perform some of its fundamental tasks. State formation in Africa is a transition process starting from an institutional endowment of ethnic division. Ethnic capital in Africa ensures the provision of many of the services that a modern state has taken over in rich countries, e.g. security, education, norms of behaviour. Few African states can deliver all these services adequately, and must go through an initial phase of federation of ethnic groups before they can provide a credible substitute for ethnic capital. The system of redistribution within and among groups is the key to creating the solidarity links between them, and its breakdown is liable to trigger political violence. A formal game-theoretic model is presented which brings out the impact of redistribution on rebellious activity, as well as the crucial role of the ability of the government to commit credibly to its expenditure policy. Without this, there is no redistribution taking place in equilibrium, and large amounts of resources are invested in warring. Civil wars, or other forms of political violence, are thus an integral part of the political economy of Africa.",

This study uses new coded data on 227 communal groups throughout the world to assess a general model of how and why they mobilize to defend and promote their collective interests. Statistical analysis shows that cultural identity, inequalities, and historical loss of autonomy all contribute substantially to their grievances. Political mobilization, grievances, and the international diffusion and contagion of communal conflict jointly explain the extent of political action in the 1980s.

            "title": "The Political Ecology of Peasant-Herder Conflicts in the Northern Ivory Coast",
            "abstract": "Following t h e great Sahelian drought of the early 1970s, an unprecedented number of Fulani pastoralists immigrated to the Ivory Coast with their cattle. Although welcomed by the lvorian government for their contribution to national beef production, the Fulani\u2019s presence has been bitterly opposed by Senufo peasants in the savanna region over the problem of uncompensated crop damage. 1 examine the nature of peasant-herder conflicts in northern Ivory Coast from a \u201cpolitical ecology\u201d perspective and argue that it is at the intersection of lvorian political economy and the human ecology of agricultural systems in the savanna region that one can begin to identify the key processes and decision-making conditions behind the current conflict. Microand macro-level processes involving the transfer of resources from Senufo households are considered to be central to the strife. The case study seeks to contribute to the growing literature on peasant-herder interactions in sub-Saharan Africa by viewing peasant-herder conflicts as \u201cresponses in context.\u201d The political ecology approach provides a framework for human ecologists interested in examining the interrelationships between local patterns of resource use and the larger political economy. Data collected to analyze the nature of the conflict in the Korhogo region during a seventeen-month period in 198182 and 1986 include survey research questionnaires, pastoral and farm management studies, participant observation and interviews with peasants, herders and livestock development officials. Key Words; peasant-herder conflicts, political ecology, crop damage, Senufo, Fulani. OST studies o n peasant-herder conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa focus o n tensions resulting from farmers migrating into pastoral zones. Conflicts usually arise over peasants cultivating rangelands important t o semi-transhumant pastoralists (Frantz 1975; Pelissier 1977; Campbell 1981). Tensions over pastoral land loss also exist in areas where farmer-herders and urban-based absentee cattle owners restrict access t o previously o p e n rangelands (Toulmin 1983; Little 1987). In short, a declining resource base for pastoralism is viewed in t h e literature as t h e primary cause of land-use conflicts be tween peasants and herders (Gallais 1979; Hjort 1982). This dwindling land base model does not adequately explain why and how some groups gain access t o land while others a re losing their rights. N o r does this perspective explain why conflicts exist between peasants and herders in relatively land abundant areas like northern Ivory Coast and central Cameroon (Blench 1984; Boutrais 1986). This article proposes a different approach to t h e study of peasant-herder interactions that offers t o answer these important human geographical questions. It argues that t h e \u201cpolitical ecology\u201d approach, which emphasizes t h e politics of land use and t h e human ecology of agricultural systems, provides insights into t h e contexts and processes underlying peasantherder conflicts and changing land-use patterns in sub-Saharan Africa. In t h e case of northern Ivory Coast, tensions between Senufo farmers and Fulani herders center o n t h e issue of uncompensated c r o p damage by cattle in peasant fields. The problem dates from t h e early 1970s when an unprecedented number of herds en tered t h e northern savanna, a region where there have been few links between peasants and herders. During t h e past fifteen years, these conflicts have been expressed through a widespread xenophobia towards t h e Fulani as well as more openly hostile acts of assault, arson and murder. Some politicians have inflamed t h e situation by promising t o banish t h e Fulani if elected.

            "abstract": "This article reports a test of a structural model of the antecedents of genocide and politicide (political mass murder). A case\u2013control research design is used to test alternative specifications of a multivariate model that identifies preconditions of geno-/politicide. The universe of analysis consists of 126 instances of internal war and regime collapse that began between 1955 and 1997, as identified by the State Failure project. Geno-/politicides began during 35 of these episodes of state failure. The analytic question is which factors distinguish the 35 episodes that led to geno-/politicides from those that did not. The case\u2013control method is used to estimate the effects of theoretically specified domestic and international risk factors measured one year prior to the onset of geno-/politicide. The optimal model includes six factors that jointly make it possible to distinguish with 74% accuracy between internal wars and regime collapses that do and those that do not lead to geno-/politicide. The conclusion uses the model to assess the risks of future episodes in 25 countries.This study was commissioned in 1998 by the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Intelligence in response to President Clinton's policy initiative on genocide early warning and prevention. It was designed by the author and carried out using her data with other data and analytic techniques developed by the State Failure Task Force. Statistical analyses reported here were done by Michael Lustik and Alan N. Unger of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), McLean, Virginia. The author is senior consultant to the Task Force, which was established in 1994 in response to a request from senior U.S. policymakers to design and carry out a data-driven study of the correlates of state failure, defined to include revolutionary and ethnic wars, adverse or disruptive regime transitions, and genocides and politicides (for the latest report on Task Force research see Goldstone et al. 2002). The author acknowledges the advice of other Task Force consultants and analysts throughout the research process. The views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent the official views of the U.S. government, the U.S. intelligence community, or the Central Intelligence Agency.The author especially thanks Ted Robert Gurr for his critiquing early drafts and using the findings to construct the table that identifies high-risk countries and groups. His insistence about the importance of the study prompted me to revise the manuscript a number of times, despite my initial reluctance, given the years of work that had gone into its preparation. It was especially hard to condense this effort from its original 75 pages. The paper also benefited from a careful reading by Mark I. Lichbach of a previous report and from comments of anonymous reviewers for the American Political Science Review.",

            "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, Africa's civil wars are not due to its ethnic and religious diversity. Using recently developed models of the overall prevalence of civil wars in 161 countries between 1960-1999, we draw lessons with special reference to Africa, showing that the relatively higher prevalence of war in Africa is not due to the ethno-linguistic fragmentation of its countries, but rather to high levels of poverty, failed political institutions, and economic dependence on natural resources. We argue that the best and fastest strategy to reduce the prevalence of civil war in Africa and prevent future civil wars is to institute democratic reforms that effectively manage the challenges facing Africa's diverse societies. To promote inter-group cooperation in Africa, specially tailored political governance and economic management institutions are needed and we advance some hypotheses on the nature of such institutions. We suggest that Africa's ethnic diversity in fact helps --it does not impede-- the emergence of stable development as it necessitates inter-group bargaining processes. These processes can be peaceful if ethnic groups feel adequately represented by their national political institutions and if the economy provides opportunity for productive activity.",

In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.",

            "abstract": "A neoclassical growth model is used to empirically test for the influences of a civil war on steady-state income per capita both at home and in neighboring countries. This model provides the basis for measuring long-run and short-run effects of civil wars on income per capita growth in the host country and its neighbors. Evidence of significant collateral damage on economic growth in neighboring nations is uncovered. In addition, this damage is attributed to country-specific influences rather than to migration, human capital, or investment factors. As the intensity of the measure used to proxy the conflict increases, there are enhanced neighbor spillovers. Moreover, collateral damage from civil wars to growth is more pronounced in the short run.",

            "abstract": "Economic models of rebellion usually treat it as a form of crime or banditry. However, the analogy is not developed. This article treats rebellion as a distinctive form of organized crime that differs from other crime in its objective, which is the predation of the rents on natural resource exports. Because such rents can be defended by government forces, rebel forces must be sufficiently large to defend themselves. This introduces a survival constraint that affects whether a rebellion is financially viable and how it reacts to increases in government forces and introduces an entry threshold. This threshold gives rise to a problem for the rebellion of attracting sufficient start-up finance. The predictions of the model are shown to be consistent with four stylized facts.",
