- dates of similar months and context (text)
  - for current as well
- current location and date of conflict
- don't provide date and location, but do provide context 
  - hopefully "anonymized"
  - compare against JUST historical data 
  - "how much more benefit does context provide"
  - hopefully ignoring leakage 
- vary how much of the time series being passed in
- vary how much context being passed in 
- summary of current month news 
- try using claude 3.5 sonnet
