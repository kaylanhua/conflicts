Support for armed violence is not tolerated in Singapore.
Sulaiman Daud|July 10, 2019, 11:23 PM
05 October 2020 - 13 November 2020

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced on July 10 that it had investigated several Myanmar nationals for using Singapore as a platform to organise and gather support for armed violence against the government of Myanmar.
"The immigration facilities of those found to be involved in activities of security concern will be cancelled, and they will be deported from Singapore."
"The immigration facilities of those found to be involved in activities of security concern will be cancelled, and they will be deported from Singapore."

Myanmar government has designated Arakan Army a terrorist group
Investigations found that this group was mobilising certain members of the Myanmar community here to support two groups, the Arakan Army (AA) and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA).
According to MHA, the AA has been designated as a "terrorist group" by the Mynamar government.
MHA also cited cases in January and March 2019 where the AA admitted to seizing large caches of weapons from police stations, killing police officers in the attacks, and reportedly abducting members of their families.
Group in Singapore supported the Arakan Army
One of the individuals investigated had a direct relationship with a "key AA leader".

At the leadership's behest, this individual actively mobilised support among the local Arakan community, and coordinated AA’s fund-raising efforts in Singapore.
He also urged the community to contribute to a "National Fund" to help build a credible fighting army, with socio-cultural events of the local Arakan community used to propagate the cause and rally support.
The individuals investigated also contributed financial support to the AA.

Live-stream video urged Rakhine people to fight for independence through Arakan Army's armed conflict
MHA described one event in particular, a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the AA and the ULA, with attendees wearing clothes bearing the "official AA logo".
Said MHA:
"The event included participants depicting the AA’s armed offensive against the Myanmar Armed Forces’ actions in Rakhine State. Actors were dressed in military uniforms with replica firearms.There was also a live streaming video in which the leader of the AA urged the Rakhine people to unite, and fight for Rakhine independence through the AA’s armed conflict against the authorities."

MHA stated that it took a very serious view of anyone supporting, promoting, or making preparations to undertake armed violence, regardless of where this will take place, or how the participants ideologically rationalised their actions.
Don't let the bad apples spoil the bunch
MHA added that foreigners living and working in Singapore have to abide by its laws, and they should not import their domestic political issues here.
However, MHA also pointed out that the large majority of Myanmar nationals in Singapore have contributed to the country and are law-abiding.
"We must be careful not to let the actions of a few individuals taint the positive contributions of the rest of the community, who live harmoniously amongst us."

Another protest is scheduled to be held on July 17 in Japan.
Kayla Wong|Matthias Ang|July 16, 2019, 07:14 PM
05 October 2020 - 13 November 2020

A group of Myanmar nationals staged a protest on Monday, July 15, in front of the Singapore Embassy in Washington D.C., the United States.

What's the protest about?
The protest was against the Singapore government's decision to deport several Myanmar nationals from Singapore.
Singapore did not mention the number of Myanmar nationals who were deported, but Myanmar media outletThe Irrawaddyreportedthat six were arrested.
Why did Singapore deport them?
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced the deportation on July 10, saying the Myanmar nationals were using Singapore as a platform to gather support for armed violence against the government of Myanmar.
MHA also says the Arakan Army (AA) has been designated as a "terrorist group" by the Myanmar government.
It cited cases in January and March 2019 where the AA admitted to seizing large caches of weapons from police stations, and killing police officers in the attacks.
Singapore's investigations found the Myanmar nationals to have been gathering support for the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA).
One of them was seen arriving in Yangon at about 11pm on July 10.


He was identified byThe Irrawaddyas Ko Tin Hlaing Oo, a spokesperson for the Arakanese Association Singapore (AAS).
Two leaders of the AAS were reported byMyanmar Timesto be arrested and briefly held by the Myanmar police on July 11 after they were deported back.

MHA stated that it took a very serious view of anyone supporting, promoting, or making preparations to undertake armed violence, regardless of where this will take place, or how the participants ideologically rationalised their actions.
Who are the Arakan Army?
According toForeign Policy, the Arakan Army was formed by Rakhine nationalists, and positions itself as the legitimate representative of the Buddhist Rakhine people, the largest ethnic group in Rakhine state, which is also known as Arakan.
It is one of the many armed groups fighting for greater autonomy in the Rakhine state.
The Straits Timesreportedthat the Rakhine nationalists had previously sided with the Myanmar military to drive out the Rohingya.
However, fighting between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military has escalated since January 2019.
Another protest to be held
Burma News Internationalreported that another protest will be staged in front of the Singapore Embassy in Japan on Wednesday, July 17.
In response toMothershipqueries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) replied:
"(i)MFA is aware that aprotest took place outside Washington Mission on 15 July;(ii)A group from the Arakan American Community delivered a letter to Washington Mission regarding the arrest of some Myanmar nationals in Singapore;(iii)MFA will convey the letter to relevant authorities;(iv)MHA has already issued a Statement on 10 July."

Title: Myanmar nationals stage protest outside Singapore embassy in Washington, Singapore News - AsiaOne
WASHINGTON - A group of Myanmar nationals staged a demonstration in front of the Singapore embassy in Washington on Monday (July 15) in protest of the Singapore government's arrest and deportation of leaders of the Arakanese Association (Singapore).
Six Myanmar nationals were arrested in Singapore last week and deported for illegally garnering support for armed violence against the Myanmar government, Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement last Wednesday.
The arrested Myanmar nationals were allegedly supporters of the Arakan Army (AA), a Rakhine insurgent group which the Myanmar government has designated a terrorist organisation. The AA is the armed wing of the United League of Arakan, which seeks greater autonomy for the Rakhine state and whose members are mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhines.
According to a statement from the Arakan Youths Union (Japan), a group of Myanmar nationals have planned a protest outside the Singapore embassy in Tokyo on Wednesday afternoon.
The Japan chapter of the Arakans Youth Union said that the arrested individuals were not connected with the Arakan Army, but instead were aiding Arakanese refugees in Myanmar. It added that the Arakan Army was not a terrorist organisation but a legitimate rebel army.
The Straits Times has contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.
[[nid:454095]]
Monday's protest at the Singapore embassy in Washington was attended by at least two dozen protesters, according to photos posted on the Voice of Arakan Twitter account.
They held handwritten placards which urged Singapore to "stop selling Arakanese to the Myanmar army", and signs with the names of the six Myanmar nationals who had been arrested.
A Burma News International article on the protest cited organisers as "denouncing the Singaporean government for transferring the leaders of the Arakan Association (Singapore) to the Myanmar police force despite knowing the Myanmar Army is committing war crimes in ethnic regions".
Meanwhile, the United States announced on Tuesday that Myanmar's army chief and four other generals would be banned from entering America due to their role in human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings in the Rakhine state, during the military-led ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in August 2017.
"With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military," said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement which used Myanmar's former name of Burma.
"We remain concerned that the Burmese government has taken no action to hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, and there are continued reports of the Burmese military committing human rights violations and abuses throughout the country," he added.

Human Rights Group Claims RCSS Violations Against Ta’ang

YANGON

The Ta’ang Human Rights Network has claimed that the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) has committed human rights abuses against over 170 Ta’ang people.

The network held a press conference in Yangon on July 11, releasing a record of human rights abuses faced by Ta’ang people over the past four years.

A total of 62 abuses were recorded between 2015 and June 2019, in which 173 Ta’ang people sustained human rights violations by the RCSS, including the seizure of motorbikes, extortion, detention and torture, said Lwey Po Se of the Ta’ang Human Rights Network.

Those abuses were committed by members of the RCSS in Kyaukme, Namkhan, Namhsan, Muse and Namtu townships in Shan State.

The RCSS is based in Loi Tai Leng, along the Thai-Myanmar border in southern Shan State, and it is active in eastern, southern and northern parts of Shan State.

Lwey Po Se accused the RCSS of arresting Ta’ang civilians on the pretext of fighting for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), then tortured them in custody before killing them and disposing of their bodies.

“The RCSS after signing the NCA [national ceasefire agreement] on October 15, 2015 started carrying out military operations, and has frequently engaged with the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military), the SSPP (Shan State Progress Party) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA),” she said. “Consequently, it has committed human rights abuses.”

Namtu locals that have experienced these abuses recounted their ordeals but requested anonymity for fear that they might be targeted by the RCSS when they are back in their native villages.

“I was detained [by the RCSS] as I returned [to my village] after selling bamboo-shoot [at the market]. [RCSS] accused me of being a Palaung [Ta’ang] soldier, and they released me after taking my money from selling bamboo-shoot and my motorbike,” said a 62-year-old Ta’ang man from Namtu Township.

The Ta’ang Human Rights Network, citing the NCA, called on the RCSS not to put the burden on civilians and to respect international laws of armed conflict.

RCSS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Sai Oo has denied the allegations of the Ta’ang Human Rights Network but admitted to arresting some civilians during armed conflicts, insisting they were not abused and were later released.

“There have been many accusations by Palaung people and women’s organizations. We have never acted out of racial discrimination anywhere, including the frontline. We have our code of conduct. We don’t violate human rights,” he told The Irrawaddy.

Despite clashes between the two sides, the RCSS does not view Ta’ang people as an enemy, he said.

“We want to tell Palaung people that we don’t commit human rights abuses. We have lived together from time immemorial and we haven’t and we are not oppressing them on racial grounds. And we also won’t do it in the future,” he added.

The Irrawaddy made field trips to over 50 villages in Namtu Township in northern Shan State last year, where locals said that besides the RCSS, the TNLA and the SSPP also detained and tortured civilians on suspicion. In some cases, some locals who were shot and arrested died of excessive bleeding.

In Namtu Township, while the RCSS detained Ta’ang locals on suspicion that they are TNLA informants, the TNLA did the same to Shan locals, accusing them of being RCSS spies.

Eleven residents of Pan Kut Village went missing last year in the forest while fleeing from clashes. Pan Kut Villagers believe that they have been detained by the RCSS. The RCSS however denied the claim.

Clashes erupted in late 2015 in Kyaukme, Hsipaw, Namtu and Lashio townships in northern Shan State between the allied forces of the TNLA and the SSPP, and the RCSS, as the latter allegedly trespassed on the former’s territories.

At the village level in northern Shan State, administrators are asked by armed groups to collect money and rice and other foodstuffs from villagers. Administrators are also forced to send their villagers to carry loads for armed groups when they march from place to place.

In May, the Tatmadaw filed a lawsuit against a village administrator in Kyaukme Township in northern Shan State under Article 17 (1) of the Unlawful Associations Act for allegedly collecting funds for the RCSS and SSPP. The village administrator said that he had to do so for his personal safety.

Title: Farmer Wounded by Landmine Blast in Northern Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG 11 July 2019
A farmer was wounded by a landmine blast Wednesday in Kutkai Township, in northern Shan State, local sources have told The Irrawaddy.
Lom Zel was working on his paddy farm when the blast went off. Zahkung Ja Naw of the Kachin Youth Organization in Kutkai Township, who helped the victim, told The Irrawaddy on Thursday that the landmine blast occurred when Lom Zel went to retrieve cattle from his farm.
“He was wounded on his stomach and on his left foot and hand. He had to call his brother-in-law to come and pick him up after the blast,” Zahkung Ja Naw said.
Lom Zel was first sent to the hospital in Kutkai Township on Wednesday evening but, because the injuries were serious, the hospital transferred him to one in Lashio.
“We arrived at the hospital in Lashio last night (Wednesday) at 11: 30 p.m. and he is in the operating room now. A medic tried to take out some sharper pieces from the explosive that could have threatened his life,” said Zahkung Ja Naw.
Lom Zel, 39, is a family man with three children.
Fighting had broken out at the scene of the blast between the Myanmar military (or Tatmadaw) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) in previous months, according to locals. Some animals, including a pig and multiple cows, have suffered wounds from landmines there as well.
It is currently the rice growing season and famers are continuing to attempt to grow food on the land, despite widespread fears of landmines.
Northern Shan State is home to several ethnic armed groups that frequently clash with the Tatmadaw. Recently, however, rival ethnic armed groups have been fighting each other—in particular the Shan groups the Restoration Council of Shan State and the Shan State Progress Party. The latter group has received assistance from the TNLA.
Northern Shan is a high-risk area for landmines, according to the Halo Trust, a U.K.-based non-governmental organization that helps landmine victims in Kachin, Shan and Karen states.
In 2018, of the 276 victims of landmine blasts nationwide, 123 were involved in incidents in Shan State. Of these, 25 were killed.
So far this year 56 people in Shan State have been involved in landmine blasts. Of these, 17 were killed.
Halo Trust reported to The Irrawaddy on May that this year, 95 percent [of landmine] victims have been from northern Shan State.
Most of the landmine explosions in the area are reported in Namtu, Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Lashio and Namsan townships.
Both the Myanmar Army and the ethnic armed groups are known to plant landmines, though they all routinely deny responsibility when civilians are killed or wounded.

Title: How Myanmar families resist armed groups recruiting children | Child Rights | Al Jazeera
Holding fake funerals or sending their children to China are among the ways Myanmar parents try to provide safety.
Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities
Mandalay, Myanmar –Sitting in a monastery in Mandalay, a city in northernMyanmar, Ake Xi* watched his family scatter flowers on his freshly dug grave, via Skype.




On the other end of the call, his twin sister held the camera in focus so he could see the picture they had placed at the head of the grave.
It was one of his younger self, a child who spent his days picking tea with his parents in plantations above their hillside village.
“I felt so strange. I wanted to shout, ‘I’m not dead!'” said Ake Xi, who is now 18.
A year has passed since his fake funeral, which was organised by his parents.
They wanted to have his name removed from their household because he was at risk of being recruited by an armed group in Shan State, an east-central region.
For a while, the fake funeral has worked.
Ake Xi is no longer linked to his home residence – he is out of reach of soldiers from the armed wing of the Restoration Council for Shan State, an armed group known as the Shan State Army-South(SSA-S), who patrol his parents’ village in search of young recruits.
Myanmar’s long-standing internal armed conflicts have been characterised by severe human rights violations and mass displacement, with forced recruitment tactics used by both the Myanmar army and non-state armed groups.
Young men are the primary target, but children are often also swept up in blanket enlistment practices.
The Myanmar military was first found guilty of using child soldiers in 2003, in a UN report on children in armed conflict.
The country remains on the list despite the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) reached in 2015, requiring the Myanmar military and signatory ethnic armed organisations to protect civilians, including by not engaging in forced conscription or the abduction of children.
The UN children’s fund (UNICEF), which monitors the implementation of a 2012 action plan to end the use of child soldiers in Myanmar, says924 minors have beendischargedby the Myanmar military in the past seven years.
But forced recruitment remains common in areas controlled by non-state armed groups.
The SSA-S is among seven ethnic armed groups in Myanmar listed by UNICEF as “persistent perpetrators” in the recruitment of child soldiers.
Last September, the UN Fact-Finding Mission to Myanmar published a report revealing thewidespread forced recruitmentof young peoplein northern Shan State villages.
Bordering China to the east, the mountainous region has seen fierce fighting since late 2015 when the SSA-S moved north into Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Shan-State Army-North strongholds.
The UN report found that “even if there is no policy of forced recruitment per se, there is no space to object to joining the ranks of certain armed groups” with abductions, torture and extortion used to coerce families into handing over their sons.
In June, these findings became a reality for Ake Xi.
His parents received an ultimatum from SSA-S soldiers: either they hand over their son or pay 10 million kyats, the equivalent of around $7,000, for another to serve on his behalf. If not, they would be taken hostage until he turned himself in.
“They locked my hand with three other men and blind-folded us as we drove out of the village,” Ake Xi said.
He claimed he was tied to a tree and interrogated at the SSA-S base.
“They wanted to know how many other families were hiding their sons,” he said.
On the third day, soldiers accompanied him back to the town and waited while he cashed in his father’s gold, the entirety of their savings.
“We had no choice,” he told Al Jazeera. “It feels like a bad dream.”
Amnesty Internationaldocumented45 cases of abductions by the TNLA and SSA-S in Shan Statebetween late 2015 and late 2016 as fighting intensified between the two warring parties.
The rights group says civilians are typically taken in groups of five to eight people. Some are forcibly removed from vehicles, others are taken from home and never seen again. Parents are also held captive until their children agree to conscript.
He cried when we sent him to China to work after he finished his studies, but he didn't have a choice...Nobody wants their children to join the rebels.
byYar San Taw*, mother-of-five
Lay Sai Nge’s arms are still marked from the ropes that bound him for the four weeks he spent as a captive of the SSA-S.
The 43-year-old was the eldest of 10 men taken from Man Li village when fighting erupted in Hsipaw township in late February, snatched from his car on the way to rescue other villagers caught in the crossfire.
Photos of himbeaten and boundwere circulated by local media, which led to his eventual release.
Six men, including minors, are yet to return home but have been spotted in posts shared by SSA-S soldiers on Facebook. In the images, they are wearing uniforms and holding guns.
Three months on from his release, Lay Sai Nge has sent 60 school-aged children from his village to live in a monastery in Ayeyarwady region in the country’s southern delta.
Like many parents Al Jazeera spoke to in rural Shan State, he is confident that there is next to no risk of recruitment outside the areas controlled by ethnic armies.
Humanitarian organisations say that since late 2016, there has been an exodus of rural youth and a spike in displacements linked to concerns about forced recruitment in northern Shan State.
Matthew Maguire, an aid worker, cited an increase in adolescents crossing to China as fighting intensified.
“Young people fled across the border to work as the risk of forced recruitment [or] being picked up for belonging to an opposing ethnic group went through the roof,” he said. “Their choices were limited: either move to an urban area or find work in China.”
Maguire, who was working with local groups on a youth dialogue project in 50 villages in Kutkai township in early 2017, says that their endeavour could not proceed as there were simply no young people to work with.
“All had fled for fear of recruitment,” he told Al Jazeera by email.
Mother of five, 43-year-old Yar San Taw* has made many sacrifices to keep her children out of harm’s way, including living without them.
“He cried when we sent him to China to work after he finished his studies, but he didn’t have a choice, I won’t let him stay here,” she told Al Jazeera from her home, holding up a photo of her 15-year-old son in the monastery where he was educated and raised from his ninth birthday.
“Even when he visited home, we worried that the army would take him,” she says, looking anxiously out the window at the base occupied by young soldiers. “Nobody wants their children to join the rebels.”
The US State Department said, in its latestcountry reporton human rights practices in Myanmar, that the unlawful use of child soldiers and forced labour of adults and children by non-state armed groups “rarely result[ed] in investigations or prosecutions”.
“I can forgive an animal that bites me that knows nothing about the law,” said Lay Sai Nge, “but these soldiers have signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement.”
For former abductees and parents grieving the forced conscription of their sons, the injustice they have faced is difficult to swallow.
“They tortured me and took away my freedom,” said Lay Sai Nge, “I cannot forgive them.”
