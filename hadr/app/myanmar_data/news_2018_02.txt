Title: Ethnic Alliance Battles to Combat Burma’s Military’s Divide and Rule Strategy and the International Community's Indifference… - Karen News
In an exclusive interview withKaren News, Twan Zaw, the United Nationalities Federal Council’s Joint General Secretary (1) and general secretary of Arakan National Council, discusses the importance of ethnic unity as Burma Army offensives continue to batter villagers in the north of the country.
We are totally concerned about the northern fighting, mainly with the members of the UNFC. We have already negotiated with the government for several months to stop fighting, that’s how we developed the so call nationwide ceasefire agreement. We all were deeply involved in the drafting process, so finally the Tatmadaw [Burma’s military] didn’t allow the all inclusiveness, so that’s why the northern groups are now currently facing the Burma Army’s massive offensive on the ground.
Being unrecognized by the government, that’s the root cause of the ethnic conflicts. As a consequence, it’s a tragedy, as the people are suffering because of the air strikes by the Burma military.
We had already discussed with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi after she took office, and at the same time, we negotiated with her representative – the peace commission and their delegation, we just talked informally recently in Chiang Mai – the peace commission will bring the results to their superiors.
It’s not two sides fighting, that’s why we call the ethnic armed groups, a resistance movement. We are stationary and living in our own territory, the Burma Army comes and attacks us, we didn’t go and attack them.
It is a shock for the ethnic people to be attacked by helicopter gunships and jet planes, that’s why it is very difficult for us to understand the Tatmadaw, it’s military motivation and why they have a strong ambition to control over the territory of the ethnic armed organizations?
The use of this force has seen hundreds of thousands of refugees flee their villages along the Chinese-Burma border.  China has not allowed them to enter into their territory. They have been moved back and now they are in very difficult position. Considering the people’s suffering, we are trying our best to solve this problem at the negotiating table.
At the same time, we’ve been resisting the Tatmadaw offensive on the ground even though they are using the militarily offensive the heavy artillery, tanks and helicopter gunships and jet fighters – it’s not like a civil war – it’s more than that.
In recent weeks [January] Pa-Laung village was attacked by the Burma Army. They used heavy artillery to shell the village, two people including a child died and. over 10 people were seriously injured.
Villagers have no protection against the Burmese Army they blame the ethic armed organizations. They accused the Ta-an National Liberation Army and the KIA, but, when we examine the shells, we can see they’re not what is used by the ethnic armed organizations.
Getting aid to the people is not allowed by the government. They know foreign or domestic aid is for humanitarian purposes. Recently, the UN’s human rights special reporter, Miss Yanhee Lee was not allowed to enter into the KIA administered zone, where there are refugee camps, she wanted to see and visit the sites and the camp, but she wasn’t allowed. They are clearly blocking humanitarian assistants.
It’s not really the government labeling the ethnic armed organisations as terrorists, it’s the Tatmadaw. People noticed that in the union parliament, they are against it, they didn’t vote. But, the military tried to get the resolution passed at the state level parliament in Shan state. The Shan state parliament passed it, they [military] won it, they succeeded. Now we are being classified as terrorists.
The state run papers managed by the government, the ministry of information does not use the term, but the Burma Army controlled newspapers, such as Myawaddy, it’s a different, they are using the term terrorist. At the same time, the government papers, the New Light of Myanmar and Kyay Mone are avoiding using that term.
The UNFC policy is to solve the fundamental problem of this country and that is the political problem. It must be solved by the political means. This is our common policy and principle. It’s been long time. Why we took up arms against the Tatmadaw is that we had no opportunity to solve the problems peacefully on the negotiating table. If there a chance and the opportunity to have negotiations, we are ready to talk. Our country’s problem is fundamentally a political problem.
The Tatmadaw does not respect the ethnic groups and that’s why our problem is prolonging. Because of that we do not have a mutual understanding and the recognition for each other. That’s the tragedy among us – it affects attempts at national reconciliation.
It’s tough to have trust in the current situation, as the Burma military wants to keep fighting and use helicopters to attack villagers. Their behavior, the military offensives on the ground is totally opposite to the desire of the people. The public is demanding peace. They are longing for peace. We, the ethnic armed groups also want peace, but the Burma military’s commitment is totally different.
We are in talks at the moment with the government but they didn’t change their policy, they didn’t accept the all inclusiveness, that’s the problem. We want all stakeholders to be involved in the process. We drafted the so-called Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, we have 16 members. There are 16 members, but they only recognize 10, so there’s the problem.
There are five members of the UNFC and an associate member of the UNFC as well. Those are TNLA, MNDDA (Kokang), WNO (Wa National Organization), Arakan National Council / Arakan Army (ANC/AA), LDU (Lahu Democrat Union) and United League of Arakan / Arakan Army (ULA/AA). (Note: ULA/AA is an associate member of the UNFC.)
We communicate. We have good relationships so far. Last July we had a plenary meeting at a KIO administered area, Mai Ja Yang. Unfortunately, the eight groups who signed the NCA, makes it a little difficult for us all to move together.
It’s a clever tactic by the government’s military strategists to divide our groups into two factions. It’s a clever strategy by them. We didn’t expect the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement to be used as a tool to divide us. But, it did happen. The NCA became a tool to divide us. We didn’t expect that. So, as long as the government or Tatmadaw [Burma’s military] is using the NCA as a tool to divide us, there won’t be peace in the country.
It is a severe blow to ethnic aspirations to be divided. Because of divisions that split ethnic unity we suffered a lot in the past. The rulers divided us and its divide and rule policy, that they inherited from the British they are still using it and it seems to be working. Even though we are consciously aware and trying to respond it still happens. We have to confess that it is a weakness of the ethnic nationalities. We have to try to change it into a strength.
Armed and unarmed, we are trying to be united. It’s not good for the country’s future as long as the ethnic organisations, over 60 percent of the population, are divided.
The ethnic issue is a blind spot for the international community. The fighting in the north is serious. We are seeing gunships and thousands of the government soldiers being used. We are seeing thousands of displaced people and yet there’re not really a great deal of outrage coming from the international community.
The current administration, the union parliament in Naypyitaw, decided to give more budget to the Tatmadaw demands. The Burma Army, gets the maximum, the majority of the budget of the country and they still ask for more. It is clear that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the commander-in-chief have agreed to compromise. She is caught in a hard place, the military through the constitution has really limited her political strength. All are working under the problematic constitution. That’s why these kinds of chaotic situations are not straight. And constitution weakens the NLD government’s politic strength. Their policy is to change the constitution, to change the system. Now they are in, she is in her second year. They have almost three years left. If they cannot conduct or fulfil their promises to the people, changing the constitution. It will affect badly on them.
The internationally community removed the sanctions too early I think. The Obama administration strongly emphasize the success of its foreign policy, but it didn’t meet the reality.
The arms embargo remains, even though they lifted the economic sanctions.  The armed embargo still affects the Burma Army. The people are suffering from the fighting. It is constantly happening and widespread. The international community should review the situation and that of its sanctions.
The international community should be tougher on Burma. There is the huge imbalance in the international community’s approach to our country’s situation. The international community mainly focuses on their business ties and their own national interest. Going through government to government, the traditional way of diplomatic relationship. This approach marginalizes the ethnic population in our country. it is difficult to understand the diplomatic language when our people have been suffering for decades without change.

Title: Myanmar administrator of a Rakhine town stabbed to death | Prothom Alo
A Myanmar official who was the administrator of a town in troubled Rakhine state when seven people died there in rioting earlier this month has been stabbed and killed, the government said on Wednesday.
Police were treating the death of Bo Bo Min Theik as a case of personal enmity and it was not related to the violence in the region, said Zaw Htay, a government spokesman.
His body was found in his car on the highway from Mrauk U to the provincial capital Sittwe on Tuesday, district officials said.
Bo Bo Min Theik was replaced as the administrator of Mrauk U and posted to the provincial government in Sittwe three days after police shot and killed seven demonstrators from the majority Buddhist community after a local gathering celebrating an ancient Buddhist Arakan kingdom turned violent.
The violence underscores the challenges facing Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a country where dozens of ethnic groups have been clamouring for autonomy since independence from Britain in 1947.
Tensions in Rakhine, previously called Arakan, have surged since a sweeping Myanmar army operation in August inflamed communal tension and triggered an exodus of over 688,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.
The military has set up over 30 militias in the areas of Rakhine where many Rohingya lived and has provided arms to three of them, Myanmar’s parliament was told on Tuesday.
Deputy Minister for Home Affairs Major-General Aung Soe told a parliamentary session that the militias were set up in the Maungdaw district of Rakhine. The Myanmar military launched a crackdown after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Maungdaw on Aug. 25, leading to the exodus.

Meanwhile, Myanmar parliament is expected to approve the Anti-trafficking in Persons Revised Law this year, based on that enacted in September 2015.

Bomb attacks in Myanmar's northern state affect govt's effort on national reconciliation: Aung San Suu Kyi - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday said the deadly bomb attacks at two banks in Lashio, Shan State on Wednesday affected government's efforts for national reconciliation.
The explosion hit Yoma bank, affecting nearby AYA bank, killing two female staffs of the former bank, injuring 21 others.
The state counselor condemned the bomb attacks targeting public areas and innocent civilians.
The authorities are investigating the incident and tight securities measures have been imposed on Lashio.
Lashio, a major trading town in northern Myanmar, is the capital city of the country's Shan state where several ethnic armed groups are active.
Earlier this month, two more ethnic armed groups -- the New Mon State Party and Lahu Democratic Union joined the government's ceasefire pact, bringing the total number of ethnic groups that have joined the Nationwide Ceasefire Accord to 10.

Title: Human Rights Watch urges Myanmar to ensure aid to civilians in Kachin

Iran Press TV
Fri Feb 9, 2018 03:29PM
Human Rights Watch has urged Myanmar's military to ensure humanitarian aid reaches all civilians who have been caught in fighting between the army and an ethnic armed group in the country's northern state of Kachin.
Fighting between Myanmar's army and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) rebels escalated in mid-January to include three townships of Kachin.
"Both the Myanmar army and the KIA should do everything possible to ensure that aid reaches civilians in need," the New York-based rights group said on Friday.
More than 120,000 people have been displaced in the state since a 17-year-old ceasefire agreement between the military and the Kachin force, one of the most powerful ethnic militias, broke down in 2011.
The military is reportedly using heavy weapons and airstrikes in its current offensive. Activists and a local lawmaker reported that at least five civilians had been killed and more than a dozen others injured in government attacks targeting KIA rebels in late January.
Aid groups active in the troubled region also said that over 3,000 other civilians, miners of amber and their families, are believed to be trapped in Tanai township.
Myanmar's authorities are under fire for a state-sponsored campaign of violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country's western state of Rakhine, which has forced about 700,000 people to flee to Bangladesh since last August.
"The embattled civilian population in Kachin state should not be forgotten amid the dire humanitarian situation facing the Rohingya," said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch.
The UN has not been granted access to the conflict-affected civilians.
On February 5, more than 5,000 people staged a protest in Kachin's capital, Myitkyina, against the military operation.
"The current situation in Kachin state is extremely worrying because it's not just one or two areas, it's happening everywhere," said Gum Sha Aung of the Joint Strategy Team, a coalition of local groups seeking to coordinate humanitarian activities in northern Myanmar.
"The military consistently hinder humanitarian assistance such as food transportation in the region, which is an outright violation against the international humanitarian law."



Title: Aung San Suu Kyi Scores 1st Win in Myanmar's Crumbling Peace Process
Print
Two ethnic armed groups added their signatures to a "nationwide" cease-fire pact with the Myanmar government, marking Aung San Suu Kyi'sfirst concrete win in a peace process undermined by recurrent conflict and stalled dialogue.In a televised ceremony in the capital Naypyidaw on Tuesday, the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Lahu Democratic Union (LDU) assented to a document the government insists is key to resolving more than 50 years of civil war between the military, dominated by the ethnic Bamar majority, and minority ethnic groups.
The NMSP, representing the Mon ethnic group, has been a prominent player in peace negotiations and for decades has run parallel government structures, including schools and law courts, in southeastern Myanmar. However, the LDU, representing the Lahu of northeastern Myanmar, is a small group that lacks military or organizational clout.The U.S. Embassy called Tuesday's signing "but one of the many steps on a long road to sustainable peace." Western governments consistently have backed Myanmar's peace process, offering advice and helping finance negotiations via a Joint Peace Fund.Entering government in early 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) inherited a process begun by a military-backed administration whose crowning achievement was the signing of a Nationwide Cease-fire Agreement with eight, out of close to 20, ethnic armed groups in Myanmar in October 2015.The NLD, whose landslide election victory extended to most ethnic minority areas, pushed peace to the top of its governing agenda.Northern problem
Shunning the back-channel approach favored by the previous government, Aung San Suu Kyi has tried to spark public enthusiasm with a series of grand-scale peace conferences.At the last conference, held in May of last year, the government and military reached agreement with the eight signatory armed groups on a number of vague "principles" that would form the core of a peace deal and, in turn, a new federal system.Myanmar's constitution, drafted under military rule, centralizes government and control of resources to the exclusion of minority ethnic groups. It also grants the military control of all security agencies, allowing them to pursue brutal objectives without civilian oversight.The autonomy retained by the military has proved fatal to Aung San Suu Kyi's efforts to build trust with the majority of armed groups that remain outside of the Nationwide Cease-fire Agreement.The military has been laying siege to one of these groups, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Myanmar's far north. In January, several thousand civilians were trapped in an amber-mining region while shells rained down on nearby KIA bases. Agencies bearing relief for displaced communities run up against tightening military blockades.Several embattled groups ranging along Myanmar's long border with China, including the KIA, have formed a Northern Alliance that rejects the government's current cease-fire deal.Together, the alliance commands the most significant firepower in Myanmar outside of the military. Seeking leverage, it has tried to draw China into a peace process that has so far avoided international mediation.Ethnic Shan analyst Sai Wansai explained to VOA that, ultimately, the participation of this northern bloc is "the key to resolve the conflict."Tuesday's singing ceremony with the NMSP and LDU, he said, "will give Aung San Suu Kyi a temporary boost. But in the long run it will not have real impact on the peace process."Military at odds
Deliberately or otherwise, military actions have also undermined Aung San Suu Kyi's efforts to win over groups outside of this more hardline Northern Alliance.The Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) was tipped to sign the nationwide cease-fire agreement alongside the NMSP, but the December killing of three KNPP soldiers and one civilian in disputed circumstances in Kayah State has severely antagonized ethnic Karenni civil society and put off KNPP participation indefinitely.The military also has obstructed the holding of community consultations by signatory armed groups. In December and January, the Restoration Council of Shan State was summarily blocked from hosting a number of public meetings.Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security, told VOA this has chilled cooperation on national-level political dialogues between signatory armed groups and the government. "When one side proposes a meeting, the other now rejects it," he said.Ethnic armed groups and the military also find themselves at increasingly bitter odds over a section of the Nationwide Cease-fire Agreement on "security reintegration."This was kept deliberately vague, after the military and the ethnic armed groups advanced competing definitions. The former pushes a doctrine of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), while the latter urges Security Sector Reform — the integration of minority ethnic forces into what is now an overwhelmingly Bamar army.Since last May's conference, however, the military has doubled-down on its call for ethnic armed group disarmament as part of a peace deal.Kim Jolliffe, an independent researcher on conflict in Myanmar, said that, besides the recent blocking of public consultations, "the main block on progress in the peace process has been the [military] insisting security reintegration' simply means DDR of ethnic armed organizations rather than holistic reform of the entire security sector."Min Zaw Oo said security reintegration, though, was not a "make or break" issue: there had simply been "too little interaction around this topic.""Once they have decided to sit down together, and explore ways, there could be some solution," he said.Min Zaw Oo said the peace process wasn't on the verge of collapse. "We are currently at the stalling point," he said, projecting progress to pick up in the middle of this year."If the military were totally stubborn, it would never have signed the Nationwide Cease-fire Agreement."
