Joint operation of India and Myanmar taking place.

India and Myanmar Armies carried out a three week long joint coordinated operation from May 16 in their respective borders, targeting many militant groups operating in Manipur, Nagaland and Assam. During 'Operation Sunrise 2' both armies coordinated with each other to bust camps of militant outfits and nabbed at least six dozen militants. As per sources, several camps of insurgents groups were also destroyed during the operation but Myanmar Army too suffered some losses in the second phase of 'Operation Sunrise 2'.
In the clashes between Myanmar and Arakan Army between May 15 and May 19, 13 Myanmar soldiers lost their lives. According to officials tracking India's Myanmar border, there are many camps of militants groups there and currently Myanmar Army is involved in complicated operations across multiple fronts. India is closely monitoring the situation.
"They are taking action against various insurgents groups who are operating at 1640 km long Indo-Myanmar border. There is turmoil in Rakhine state too where the terrorist group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) is continuously targeting them. With the help of foreign help, ARSA is gaining strength", according to an officer in the security establishment.
In total, there are around 50 militant hideouts along the border and depending on the situation, a third phase of 'Operation Sunrise' may be launched. The Indian Army had carried out the first phase of 'Operation Sunrise ' between February 17-March 2, on its own area along the Indo-Myanmar border. It is said to have destroyed almost 12 camps of insurgent groups. Despite the joint operation by India and the Myanmar Army in March against the insurgent group, Arakan Army, the danger on the Kaladan transit project is not over yet.The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project is viewed as India's gateway to Southeast Asia.
India entered into a framework agreement with Myanmar in April 2008, to facilitate the implementation of the project. On completion, the project will help connect Mizoram with the Sittwe Port in Rakhine State of Myanmar. On the Indian side, work is on to extend the Aizawl-Saiha National Highway by 90 km to the international border at Zorinpui.
''The Arakan Army is getting help from abroad. They are getting arms and explosive training to launch massive attack on Myanmar Army. It's very tough situation for them, on one hand, they are fighting against  Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and there is another big challenge to fight against Arakan Army,'' according to an official attached to the Defence Ministry of India.
The operation was done in south Mizoram and the Army had described it as a great success. But on the ground, the situation remains complicated and the Myanmar Army is expecting more help from India so the Kaladan Project can be secured fully.
''The Arakan Army had attacked a Burmese vessel carrying 300 steel frames for the Paletwa Bridge and abducted the entire crew but they were later released. The vessel had sailed from Yangon to Paletwa. The Arakan Army is conspiring to launch more such lethal attacks,'' said a security officer working in the Indian security establishment.

Title: Time for Asean to recognise Rohingya as an ethnic group
LETTER| On behalf of all ethnic Rohingya, the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingya Human Rights Organisation Malaysia (Merhrom) welcomes the 34th Asean Summit 2019 that will be held in Bangkok from June 20 to 23.

The ethnic Rohingya hope something will be done to resolve our plight. We hope Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who will lead the Malaysian delegation, will raise the plight of Rohingya during the summit.
We believe Mahathir has the capacity to bring together all Asean member states and end the Rohingya genocide in the region.
We are very thankful to the Malaysian government, which has hosted Rohingya refugees for many years. We hope the Malaysian government will help us by leading member states to end the genocide, which would also put a stop to human trafficking.
The Rohingya were made stateless by the Myanmar government, but we are a legitimate ethnic group. Recognition as such would pave the way for our plight to end.

During last year's summit, Asean states reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Community Vision 2025 and the Leader’s Vision for a Resilient and Innovative Asean.
Heads of member states also stressed the need to find a comprehensive and durable solution to address the root causes of the conflict and to create a conducive environment so that the affected communities can rebuild their lives.
However, there has been no positive change in the situation in Arakan. The Rohingya continue to be victimised, especially after the fight between the Myanmar military with the Arakan Army (AA).

With the theme ‘advancing partnership for sustainability’, we hope Asean member states at the summit will give top priority to ending the Rohingya genocide. This is a very important step in achieving the Asean Community Vision 2025.
How do we ensure that we are advancing partnership for sustainability when the Rohingya genocide is ongoing? We must put an end to this in order to foster economic and political cooperation in the region.
We call on the heads of Asean member states, as well as foreign and women's ministers, to visit the largest Rohingya refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar and meet with refugees and get first-hand information.
We hope that with that information, the Asean leadership can draw a permanent solution for the Rohingya in Arakan State.
Repatriation is not the solution to the Rohingya genocide. Asean leaders must not agree to the plan to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar, as long as the genocide is ongoing.
We must learn from the past repatriation by the Bangladeshi and Myanmar governments, where thousands were persecuted by the latter once they arrived in Arakan. Furthermore, this will only increase human trafficking and benefit syndicates.

Currently, there are many IDP camps in Arakan established in 2012, which primarily host ethnic Rohingya.
The Myanmar government still cannot resolve this issue. Seven years have passed, but still the Rohingya cannot return to their homes.
How are we going to repatriate over one million Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar to Myanmar while the IDP issue remains unresolved?

In conjunction with World Refugee Day today, Merhrom calls upon the UN Security Council, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, world leaders and the international community to come together to end the Rohingya genocide.
We must have the political will to do so. Otherwise, our efforts and resources will be wasted. We cannot wait any further as the Rohingya genocide is already at the last stage.
We hope on World Refugee Day 2019, there is new hope for the Rohingya and the rest of the refugees around the world.
We hope that together, we can fight the crimes against humanity and end the genocide in this century.

ZAFAR AHMAD ABDUL GHANI is the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingya Human Rights Organization Malaysia.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Asia (26 June 2019) - Afghanistan | ReliefWeb
Afghanistan+ 12 more
The key trends in the South and Southeast Asian region last week included fighting between Taliban and Afghan security forces in Afghanistan; ongoing fighting between state forces and domestic rebel groups in Pakistan, India, Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines; as well as demonstrations over water supply issues, land rights, and environmental concerns across the region.
InAfghanistanlast week, fighting took place across the country but was once again focused in the southeast as both Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters attempted to gain a foothold in contested territory. Afghan military and NATO air and artillery assaults reportedly led to high Taliban fatalities in the provinces of Zabul and Faryab, although no territory was exchanged. Elsewhere, however, Taliban reported that they captured tens of villages following heavy clashes in two districts of Wardak, as well as more minor gains in Shuhada district of Badakhshan. Both provinces are strategic to the Taliban, with Wardak neighboring Kabul, and Badakhshan bordering both Pakistan and Tajikistan.
In the northeast, meanwhile, there were once again reports of Taliban and Islamic State (IS) fighters clashing in Kunar province. Earlier this year, thousands of civilians were displaced by fighting between the two groups over territory in the mountainous Chapa Dara district (VOA News, 4 April 2019). Last week, hundreds more were displaced by fighting in both Chapa Dara and Dara-I-Pech districts. With IS taking losses in Iraq and Syria as of late, the group’s Afghan chapter appears to be quietly expanding outside of its stronghold of Nangarhar and into defensive mountain regions like Chapa Dara (Al Jazeera, 10 June 019).
Domestic rebel and separatist groups were also active in other South and Southeast Asian countries. InPakistan, domestic militant groups continue to be active in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan province. Suspected separatists inThailandand the New People’s Army (NPA) in thePhilippinescontinued to engage in violence in their respective countries.
InIndia, security forces continued to conduct cordon and search operations (CASO) in several districts of Jammu & Kashmir while Maoist rebels continued to clash with security forces in central India. Maoist rebels also stepped up their attacks against civilians, reportedly executing three civilians, including a Samajwadi Party (SP) leader, who had contested the recent assembly elections. Maoist rebels have previously targeted government officials and candidates running for office.
InMyanmar, fighting between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army (AA) was particularly deadly around Minbya township in Rakhine state last week. As fighting continues, internet service in northern Rakhine and southern Chin states was shut down, causing many to question whether this is a prelude to increased human rights violations  in the area (Reuters, 24 June 2019). Also, notably, last week, the Myanmar military and Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA) clashed
twice in Kutkai township in Shan state; the clashes come as the unilateral ceasefire declared by the military covering Kachin and Shan states is set to end this month. As well, for the first time this year, the military’s Border Guard Force clashed with a splinter DKBA group in Kayin state.
Activists came under attack in the region last week inVietnam, thePhilippines, andPakistan.This is of note inVietnam: a country where such events rarely make international headlines. In thePhilippines, specifically, there has been a growing trend of “red-tagging” in the
country; reports note that Philippine authorities have been “red-tagging” legitimate organizations, branding them as “communist fronts,” resulting in their members being targeted (Amnesty International, 24 June 2019). This is reflective of the branding of opposition members as “drug
suspects” by Philippine authorities, which has also resulted in the targeting and deaths of those individuals (Al Jazeera, 25 June 2019).
Elections remained a theme inIndia, Bangladesh, andIndonesia. InIndia, while political violence subsided in most parts of the countries following the general elections, clashes and targeted attacks resulting from political rivalries continued to be reported from West Bengal and Tripura. Last week, upazila parishad (sub-district council) elections were held in 16 upazilas inBangladesh. Even though elections have previously led to widespread violence in the country, only sporadic incidents of election violence were reported during this latest round of elections. While demonstrations against the results of the recent general election inIndonesiahave decreased, last week a rally was held near the constitutional court in Central Jakarta in support of Prabowo Subianto’s challenge of the presidential election result. A ruling on the dispute is expected on 27 June with security forces on standby in the event that demonstrations by those dissatisfied with the results should occur as they did with the deadly riots in May (The Jakarta Post, 24 June 2019).
In other developments, land and labour issues led to demonstrations inIndia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Malaysia, andCambodialast week, a trend often seen across the Asia region. Demonstrations were also reported over water supply issues. Such demonstrations tend to be seen each year in South Asia, especially as summer draws near and temperatures increase. Water supply and management issues led to a rising number of demonstrations, as well as to several incidents of communal violence in rural and urban areas, inIndia, Pakistan, Nepal, andSri Lanka. Meanwhile, inThailand, as the country prepared to host the ASEAN Summit, protesters in Bangkok demonstrated against other countries sending their waste to Southeast Asia, a growing issue in the region (The New York Times, 7 June 2019).
In other news, inSri Lanka, the President extended the country’s state of emergency status by another month, following the Easter Day bombings on hotels and churches that killed more than 250 people (India Today, 23 June 2019). The emergency law allows the detention and interrogation of suspects without court orders, providing Sri Lankan police and military with sweeping powers which have led to a number of arrests across the country.

Next:LEADERSHIP: Credit Where Credit Is Overdue
June 20, 2019:The UN revealed an internal report on how the UN handled the crises created when a million Rohingya (Burmese Moslems) who were driven out of Burma into Bangladesh in 2017 by the Burmese military. The UN blames itself for not taking action in 2017. What really happened was Chinese intervention. China is an ally of Burma and the Chinese veto (and considerable clout in the UN) blocked any UN action against Burma. The anti-Rohingya violence that caused all this was instigated by nationalist Buddhist religious leaders and the Burmese military took advantage of it. The Burmese military was forced to give up a lot of their decades of dictatorial power in 2011 and agree to a restoration of democracy. That meant the Buddhist nationalists could go after the Rohingya, something the military dictatorship had put on hold. After 2012 the threat of international sanctions gave the military more power in Burma to resist corruption investigations and interference with their profitable, but illegal, activities in the north. China prefers to work with the Burmese military, which makes Burmese democrats uneasy. The military leaders (but active and those retired and in politics) find that they are losing more and more popular support in Burma because of the Rohingya mess and are actually quite willing to make a deal, as long as it does not involve allowing a lot of Rohingya to return. That is one thing most Burmese agree on. The UN has similar problems with China in the UN, where it is considered prudent to not criticize China directly. So the UN blames itself, officially, but everyone knows who is really at fault in a particular situation.
Northern Disorder
The government has other problems in the north beside the Rohingya, mainly the continued feuding between some rival rebel groups or between rebels and the military. So far this year the army has arranged a truce between SSA-S (Shan State Army-South) and SSA-N (Shan State Army-North). These two groups have a lot in common but have been fighting over disagreements over how to interpret the terms of the NCA (National Ceasefire Agreement) the SSA-S signed in 2015. The army and tribes often do not agree on details of ceasefire or peace deals and fighting resumes.
The Chinese continue to have problems up north. China has a lot of legal and illegal operations in northern Burma and many of these run into trouble with the Burmese government or the locals (or both). The Chinese operating commercial (rather than Chinese government) enterprises in northern Burma (Kachin and Shan states) are a major source of complaints. There seems to be no end of illegal schemes the Chinese come up with that profit at the expense of Burmese. Some of the more recent rackets involve illegal casinos and distributing drugs (as well as getting the drugs into China). Then there are the people traffickers who entice or kidnap Burmese women to China and sell them to Chinese men to be wives or prostitutes. There a growing shortage of Chinese women that has created a market for young foreign women. China's "one child" policy of the last few decades and the ability to determine the sex of the child before birth led to more (20 percent more) boys than girls being born in China. There's a growing shortage of potential brides, and desperate Chinese men are willing to buy a kidnapped tribal girl from northern Burma (or anywhere else). Some of the Chinese criminal gangs have become ambitious, bringing more than a hundred of their Chinese members into northern Burma to run these operations. That also offends Burmese as the Chinese almost always bring in their own labor force to build Chinese financed projects. Annoying so many Burmese has consequences as many Burmese are willing to tip off the police about what Chinese gangsters are up to. The Chinese will try to bribe the police but for major police operations that is often impossible (or simply too expensive).
June 18, 2019: In the northwest (Sagaing Region, west of Kachin State), the months of cooperation by Indian and Burmese troops along the border was recently described by Indian mass media as “joint operations”. The head of the Burmese military objected to the “joint” angle and insisted that Burmese troops were coordinating operations as both sides of the border were searched for camps established by Burmese and Indian rebel groups. No troops crossed the border so there were no “joint” operations. The main target of these coordinated efforts is Indian and Burmese Naga rebels. The Sagaing region has long been used as a refuge for Indian rebels but since February Indian and Burmese forces have been coordinating efforts to shut down the border camps for good, or at least for a long time. The latest phase of these operations just ended and there is still more to do. In March Indian and Burmese swept both sides of the border for weeks but later discovered that, while this hurt the Naga rebels it did not destroy the rebel groups, who returned to the border area once the troops had ceased their activity. In response Burmese troops began to patrol the area for several months, or as long as it took for India to certify that the Naga rebels have suffered serious and long-term damage. Indian troops were also active on their side of the border to ensure that the Naga rebels, both the Indian and Burmese ones, have nowhere to go and that situation will last so long (several months) that many of rebels will desert and return to their villages. Other rebel groups will be cornered by Indian or Burmese troops and destroyed.
Most of the Naga people are Indian but some live in the Burmese far north Sagaing Region and belong to the NSCN (National Socialist Council of Nagaland) which wants to form an independent Nagaland including Indian and Burmese territory and Naga people from both countries. Many of the camps being sought in Sagaing belong to the NSCN-K faction of the NSCN. At the start of 2019, there were believed to be about 5,000 active rebels in NSCN with about ten percent of them Burmese Naga. This new operation seeks to reduce the size of NSCN by a significant amount. How much damage will be done won’t be known until the end of 2019. These operations are not just going after the NSCN but also smaller groups like the Ulfa-I, NDFB and Manipur rebels.
The Naga are actually about two million people from a collection of tribes that share many ethnic (Burma-Tibetan) characteristics and traditions. About ten percent of the Naga live in Burma but most of the rebel violence occurs in Indian Nagaland. For years the Naga rebels have used bases in Burma to train and rest before returning to fight in India. After much diplomatic pressure, the Burmese army finally went after the Naga rebel camps and have now shut most of them down or at least made them very difficult to maintain. The Naga rebels do not fight the Burmese soldiers but always retreat. For this new operation, Burmese soldiers have orders to pursue and capture or kill any rebels they encounter. If the rebels head for India the Indian Army is alerted and moves troops into position to confront any rebels crossing the border to escape Burmese troops.
June 16, 2019: In the north (Shan state), fighting broke out again between the army and the TNLA (Tang National Liberation Army). These fights are usually over control of disputed territory and this time the army is advancing on TNLA outposts and camps. This latest outburst of violence had caused over 200 villagers to flee their homes to avoid the shooting.
June 11, 2019: In southwest Thailand (Satun province), which borders Malaysia, a smuggler boat carrying 65 illegal Burmese Rohingya Moslems headed for Malaysia was discovered by police. Because of bad weather, the boat had been driven ashore on an island off the coast and was stuck. The Rohingya were from a refugee camp in Bangladesh and the boat was operated by six men (a Thai captain and five Burmese crew). Thai and Malaysian police are trying to find out if the boat operators are part of a larger smuggling operation. This incident was not unique as groups of illegal migrants have been found in the forest areas along the border with Malaysia. In one recent case, the illegals had lost their guide and were themselves lost and starving when troops found them. The 65 recent refugees were trapped on the island.
June 6, 2019: In the northwest (Sagaing Region, west of Kachin State), the NSCN-K faction of the NSCN (National Socialist Council of Nagaland) rebels said they would not sign the NCA (Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement) with the government. This version of the NCA was agreed to in 2015 and since then most tribal rebels have agreed to it.
May 30, 2019: The government presented China with a set of additional conditions to modify the CMEC (China-Myanmar Economic Corridor) agreement China and Burma signed in September 2018. That agreement called for both countries to begin detailed negotiations on where a 1,700 kilometer long transportation corridor from southern China (Yunan province) to central Burma (Mandalay) and then west to the coast at the Kyaukpyu SEZ (Special Economic Zone) will be built and what it will consist of. The corridor would improve roads, railroads and build, as needed, pipelines and electrical transmission lines. This would be financed by China and built mainly by Chinese construction firms. CMEC paid special attention to the risk of a “debt trap” where Burma might find itself with debt it could not repay unless it turned over new facilities to Chinese ownership or control. This has happened in other nations, most recently in Sri Lanka. Burma needs the investment and since 1988 China has been the major foreign investor in Burma with projects totaling $20 billion so far. Burma told China it was working on special “debt trap” provisions and the main one is for China to allow foreign nations to provide some of the loans needed for the CMEC work. That is now under consideration.
CMEC is the Burma component of the massive Chinese Obor (One Belt, One Road) effort. Also called BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), Obor is all about China building roads, railroads, pipelines and ports to make it easier for Chinese imports and exports to move around, from East Asia to Europe, Africa and more. Pakistan, Nepal, Thailand Sri Lanka and Burma are all Obor participants that are seeing billions of dollars in construction Chinese projects taking place and the terms of these deal tend to favor China, not the country where the construction takes place. Not surprisingly many people in these Obor countries see the Chinese investments as another form of colonialism. China prefers not to call it colonialism but rather seeking to expand its commercial activities.  The Burmese tribes have long depended on Chinese cash and diplomatic influence to survive. China is working that angle as much as it can to get their costly development projects operational and want long-term peace with the tribes to keep the Chinese investments safe and profitable. Many of the tribal people are more willing to trust the Chinese than their own government which puts it all on China to make this work. While these Chinese projects often displace tribal people, usually without any compensation, the Chinese are more willing to make long-term deals with the locals. For the Chinese, it is just business while the Burmese see the tribes as potential rebels and long-term antagonists.
May 26, 2019: In the west (Chin state) soldiers moving up a river on four boats were ambushed by members of the AA (Arakan Army) tribal rebels. Both sides dispute how many casualties there were. The AA accused the army of entering AA territory without permission and this violence has been going on for about ten days with troops advancing from several directions. The AA claims the army has been using there usual tactics of firing artillery at local villages suspected of supporting the rebels. The AA says there have been over fifty civilian casualties so far this year, including at least twenty dead. The army denies they do this but their track record over the last few decades says otherwise. So far this year there have been over 200 clashes between the AA and the security forces (army and police) which has caused over 300 casualties among the forces involved. Neither side agrees on how many losses each side has suffered. Some of this fighting took place neighboring (to the south) Rakhine state. The fighting continues into mid-June.

Next:LEADERSHIP: Credit Where Credit Is Overdue
June 20, 2019:The UN revealed an internal report on how the UN handled the crises created when a million Rohingya (Burmese Moslems) who were driven out of Burma into Bangladesh in 2017 by the Burmese military. The UN blames itself for not taking action in 2017. What really happened was Chinese intervention. China is an ally of Burma and the Chinese veto (and considerable clout in the UN) blocked any UN action against Burma. The anti-Rohingya violence that caused all this was instigated by nationalist Buddhist religious leaders and the Burmese military took advantage of it. The Burmese military was forced to give up a lot of their decades of dictatorial power in 2011 and agree to a restoration of democracy. That meant the Buddhist nationalists could go after the Rohingya, something the military dictatorship had put on hold. After 2012 the threat of international sanctions gave the military more power in Burma to resist corruption investigations and interference with their profitable, but illegal, activities in the north. China prefers to work with the Burmese military, which makes Burmese democrats uneasy. The military leaders (but active and those retired and in politics) find that they are losing more and more popular support in Burma because of the Rohingya mess and are actually quite willing to make a deal, as long as it does not involve allowing a lot of Rohingya to return. That is one thing most Burmese agree on. The UN has similar problems with China in the UN, where it is considered prudent to not criticize China directly. So the UN blames itself, officially, but everyone knows who is really at fault in a particular situation.
Northern Disorder
The government has other problems in the north beside the Rohingya, mainly the continued feuding between some rival rebel groups or between rebels and the military. So far this year the army has arranged a truce between SSA-S (Shan State Army-South) and SSA-N (Shan State Army-North). These two groups have a lot in common but have been fighting over disagreements over how to interpret the terms of the NCA (National Ceasefire Agreement) the SSA-S signed in 2015. The army and tribes often do not agree on details of ceasefire or peace deals and fighting resumes.
The Chinese continue to have problems up north. China has a lot of legal and illegal operations in northern Burma and many of these run into trouble with the Burmese government or the locals (or both). The Chinese operating commercial (rather than Chinese government) enterprises in northern Burma (Kachin and Shan states) are a major source of complaints. There seems to be no end of illegal schemes the Chinese come up with that profit at the expense of Burmese. Some of the more recent rackets involve illegal casinos and distributing drugs (as well as getting the drugs into China). Then there are the people traffickers who entice or kidnap Burmese women to China and sell them to Chinese men to be wives or prostitutes. There a growing shortage of Chinese women that has created a market for young foreign women. China's "one child" policy of the last few decades and the ability to determine the sex of the child before birth led to more (20 percent more) boys than girls being born in China. There's a growing shortage of potential brides, and desperate Chinese men are willing to buy a kidnapped tribal girl from northern Burma (or anywhere else). Some of the Chinese criminal gangs have become ambitious, bringing more than a hundred of their Chinese members into northern Burma to run these operations. That also offends Burmese as the Chinese almost always bring in their own labor force to build Chinese financed projects. Annoying so many Burmese has consequences as many Burmese are willing to tip off the police about what Chinese gangsters are up to. The Chinese will try to bribe the police but for major police operations that is often impossible (or simply too expensive).
June 18, 2019: In the northwest (Sagaing Region, west of Kachin State), the months of cooperation by Indian and Burmese troops along the border was recently described by Indian mass media as “joint operations”. The head of the Burmese military objected to the “joint” angle and insisted that Burmese troops were coordinating operations as both sides of the border were searched for camps established by Burmese and Indian rebel groups. No troops crossed the border so there were no “joint” operations. The main target of these coordinated efforts is Indian and Burmese Naga rebels. The Sagaing region has long been used as a refuge for Indian rebels but since February Indian and Burmese forces have been coordinating efforts to shut down the border camps for good, or at least for a long time. The latest phase of these operations just ended and there is still more to do. In March Indian and Burmese swept both sides of the border for weeks but later discovered that, while this hurt the Naga rebels it did not destroy the rebel groups, who returned to the border area once the troops had ceased their activity.

Ethnic chieftains' attires displayed in Myanmar - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Rare Myanmar ethnic attires, worn by Shan chieftains over a century ago, are being displayed in Yangon, aimed at enhancing the spirit of an ethnic race to cherish its culture and traditions.
The 10-day exhibition, which began on Sunday at the National Museum, is sponsored by the Department of Archaeology, the National Museum and Library under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture.
The exhibition displays costumes worn by and items used by Shan chieftains of various regions throughout the past successive eras and demonstrates the civilization of a race which can be studied through their costumes, style of dress, literature and culture, said Minister of Ethnic Affairs Naing Thet Win.
Chief Minister of Yangon Region U Phyo Min Thein said the exhibition promotes the image of the Myanmar races, suggesting the conservation and display of the culture and tradition of other ethnic races.
Noting that all the national races are living in amity in the union, the chief minister stressed the need for all to join hands and take up the duty to preserve and protect the ethnic culture and tradition.
Shan chieftains' attires were made of various types of fiber and decorated with patterns.
The Shan state was an ethnic state of Myanmar lying in the northeastern part of the country and covering 155,800 square km, almost a quarter of the total area of Myanmar.

Title: Ice, Ice Maybe? Myanmar Cop Held For Crystal Meth Switch
Drug experts believe Myanmar may now be the world's biggest meth producer. (Representational)
A Myanmar policeman has been arrested after switching 64 kilograms (140 pounds) of seized crystal meth with salts loosely resembling the party drug known as "ice", officials said Tuesday.
Officers stumbled across the suspect packages of confiscated ice around a week ago as they carried out an inventory of seized narcotics at a police station ahead of an annual burning to mark an international day against drugs on June 26.
"Sixty-four packages out of 103 were fake," Deputy Police Colonel Myint Swe, chief of Kengtung district police force in Shan State told AFP, adding each package weighed one kilo (2.2 pounds).

A kilo of ice is worth around 20 million kyats ($13,000) locally, giving the pilfered product a value of around $830,000 inside Myanmar.
It fetches several times more the further it travels from source.
Police Sergeant Myint Naing was arrested on Sunday, several hours drive away, and had been flown back to Kengtung for interrogation, police said.
"We found that he substituted the ice with alum (crystallised potassium) salt and other things which look similar to ice," a senior drugs police officer in the capital Naypyidaw told AFP, requesting anonymity.
Drug experts believe Myanmar may now be the world's biggest meth producer, with jungle labs in ungovernable areas of Shan state churning out untold tonnes of ice and hundreds of millions of meth pills -- known regionally as "yaba".
Made-in-Myanmar yaba is pouring west into Bangladesh and east into Laos, Thailand and beyond in record amounts.
On Monday an anti-drugs team seized 1.85 million pills worth an estimated $2.4 million at a checkpoint in northern Shan, local officials announced on Tuesday.
High-grade crystal meth -- or "ice" -- is smuggled out of Myanmar via sophisticated networks to lucrative developed markets as far away as Japan, South Korea, and Australia.
In late March Myanmar authorities seized 1.7 tonnes of ice worth nearly $30 million in a boat off the country's south.

Title: Operation Sunrise: India-Myanmar target insurgent groups camp in North East - India Today
Listen to Story
In the last five months the armies of India and Myanmar have launched two phases of joint operations along the Myanmar border targeting camps of insurgent groups operating in North East. Named Operation Sunrise, the strategy is aimed at hitting militant groups that are impacting both India and Myanmar.
The first phase of this operation was launched in February when several camps were destroyed in Myanmar close to the border, both in the north and south closer to Mizoram in India.
"There was actionable intelligence that many of them are regrouping. This prompted us to share information with Myanmar leading to the joint operations," said an official in the security establishment.
Sources said the two countries have to come to an understanding that whenever there will be intelligence on the activities and regrouping of this cadres and leadership such operations will be launched.
After facing heavy losses following coordinated operations by the Myanmar and Indian armies forcing the Naga rebel group NSCN (K) to shut camps in Taga, Myanmar, the faction is again regrouping to take control of the lost ground, intelligence reports indicate.
Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) or NSCN (K) has been giving orders for reopening of the base area and council headquarters at Taga seriously.
Other than NSCN (K), the groups hit were Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), the the United Liberation Front of Assam, and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).
In February when the first phase of the Operation Sunrise was launched, the trigger was a threat to the mega Kaladan Project.
The transit project will connect Kolkata to Sitwe port in Myanmar and finally end up linking Mizoram. This will be a new gateway to the landlocked North East reducing the distance from Kolkata to Mizoram by nearly a thousand kilometres bringing down the travel time by at least four days.
It is noteworthy that China has also been carrying out development projects at Kyaukpyu port near Sitwe.
While the militant group Arakan Army was pushed back then after they had reached the tip of Mizoram, sources said recent intelligence inputs reveal they could still be targeting the Kaladan Project and are making efforts to regroup.
The Arakan Army, an insurgent group in Myanmar set up new bases along the Mizoram border setting alarm bells in both the countries. This meant their cadres traveled hundreds of kilometres to come close to the southern most tip of Mizoram.
In the last two years the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) that trains the Arakan Army in the Kachin State of Myanmar adjoining China had readied around 3000 cadres.
Many of them moved to the south closing in on areas adjoining the Lawngtala district of Mizoram. This is the area that cuts through the proposed Kaladan project that will link Sitwe in Myanmar to Mizoram, sources said.Also read |22-year-old blogger and journalist Muhammad Bilal Khan, known for criticising Pakistan's ISI, hacked to deathAlso read |Pakistan army appoints Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as new ISI chiefAlso watch |PM Modi names and shames Pakistan at SCO SummitPublished By:Anumika BahukhandiPublished On:Jun 17, 2019--- ENDS ---

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Asia (11 June 2019) - Afghanistan | ReliefWeb
Afghanistan+ 9 more
Last week in South and Southeast Asia, as many Muslims celebrated the end of Ramadan, a decline in event numbers was recorded in countries including Pakistan and Bangladesh, while deadly riots were reported in Indonesia. The key trends in the region last week included heavy fighting between Taliban and Afghan security forces in Afghanistan; targeted attacks on civilians by militant groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Thailand; as well as ongoing post-election violence in India.
In Afghanistan last week, heavy fighting continued between Afghan forces and Taliban militants despite initial hope for an Eid al-Fitr ceasefire. The majority of operations took place in the provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, and Ghazni. In the latter, Afghan state forces succeeded in reclaiming control of Khwaja Umari district following consistent assaults over the past year (TOLO News, 07 June 2019). Late last month, Dih Yak district was also retaken. Both had been captured by the Taliban during their 2018 spring offensive, which had focused heavily on territorial gains in Ghazni province.
Moreover, there were a number of incidents last week where civilians were reportedly killed or wounded by Afghan forces, NATO, and militant groups. Among these were three back-to-back explosions in Kabul city, one of which targeted a bus of alleged Shiite Muslim civilians. The Afghan Islamic State (IS) affiliate claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came only days after an IS suicide bomber detonated themselves outside the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul. While IS tends to be more active during Ramadan, it is possible that these attacks also signal a rise in the affiliate group’s strength. According to both Afghan and US officials, IS has undertaken mass recruitment drives – both inside Afghanistan and from nearby countries like Uzbekistan – and continues to stockpile weapons and supplies in the mountainous regions of Nangarhar and Kunar where the group operates. More generally, IS has continued to expand its presence globally throughout 2019 (for more on this, see this recentACLED infographic). There is fear that with IS losing ground in both Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan may become its new base of operations (Associated Press, 10 June 2019).
In Pakistan, domestic militant groups continue to be active in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province last week. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, militants launched three attacks in North Waziristan tribal district where a sharp increase in attacks targeting security forces has been recorded recently. As many as 12 security force personnel have reportedly been killed and 38 have been reported injured in the last month (Tribal News Network, 8 June 2019). Meanwhile, in Balochistan province, militants launched two targeted attacks on security personnel and two IED attacks on members of the Shia Hazara and Bohra communities. In 2019, the Shia Hazara community has been the repeated target of militant violence, most notably in April this year when a suicide bomber attacked Quetta’s Hazarganji market (Dawn, 12 April 2019).
Civilians were also the target of organized violence in India and Thailand last week. In India, suspected militants reportedly shot dead two civilians and an off-duty Territorial Army soldier in separate targeted attacks in Jammu & Kashmir state. In Thailand, while separatist violence declined last week, in Narathiwat, suspected separatists reportedly shot and killed a civilian, a village chief who was praying in a mosque. The violence comes as Prayut Chan-ocha of the military-backed Palang Pracharat Party was selected to be the new Prime Minister (Asia Times, 5 June 2019), thus ensuring the military’s continued dominance in Thai politics.
Meanwhile, in Myanmar, civilian deaths were reported as a result of fighting between the Arakan Army and Myanmar military, which was concentrated last week in Minbya and Ponnagyun townships in Rakhine state. In both townships, artillery shells from nearby fighting fell in civilian areas and killed several villagers. Heavy fighting also led to many casualties on both sides of the conflict.
In India, three weeks after the last day of voting, post-election violence continued across the country, especially in West Bengal. Last week, 16 people were reportedly killed in election-related violence.
Various issues led to demonstrations in the region last week. In Sri Lanka, people across the country took to the streets in support of a senior Buddhist monk, demanding the removal of a Muslim minister, eastern province governor, and western province governor from their respective posts after the Easter Sunday bombings. In Malaysia, in Johor Baru, a protest was held by Orang Asli villagers demanding a resolution regarding compensation for their lands. A raise in tobacco taxes led around 1,000 tobacco farmers to protest in Phetchabun province in Thailand. Meanwhile, around 1,000 Lisu villagers protested in Kachin state in Myanmaragainst the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA), claiming the KIO/KIA had carried out unlawful detentions of Lisu villagers.
In other news, 13 people were reportedly killed in police drug raids in the Philippines, a decline from the previous week. In Indonesia, a man believed to be a member of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) set off a suicide bomb at a police post in Central Java.
