Title: Govt’s timely intervention saved five Indians from Arakan Army in Myanmar: MHA | India News - The Indian Express
The Indian government on Tuesday said its “timely intervention” ensured the release of five Indians and five Myanmar nationals, including an MP, who had been taken hostage by an ethnic rebel group in the country’s restive Rakhine province.
The Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement that the five Indian nationals, along with a Member of Myanmar Parliament, two local transporters and two speedboat operators, were abducted by the Arakan Army on Sunday while on their way from Paletwa in Chin State to Kyauktaw in Rakhine.
The abducted Indians were engaged in building the Kaladan road project in Myanmar.
“Timely intervention by the government of India has ensured release of five abducted Indian nationals, a Member of Myanmar Parliament and four other Myanmar nationals from Arakan Army in the Rakhine State of Myanmar, in the early hours on Monday,” the statement said.
One Indian national died in the Arakan Army’s custody due to a heart attack, it added.
According to information available, he was a chronic diabetes patient. The released Indian nationals, along with the body of the deceased, have reached Sittwe and will leaving for Yangon on Tuesday for their onward journey to India, it said.
The Arakan Army is a Rakhine based insurgent group founded as the armed wing of the United League of Arakan (ULA).
It has been fighting for almost a decade for greater autonomy of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.
This is the first time the Arakan Army has captured foreign workers in the resource-rich area, which hosts a series of infrastructure projects linking India and Myanmar.
The rebels confirmed the Indian worker’s death as the group were marched up a hill.
“Unfortunately he suddenly died from exhaustion… we did not do anything to him,” Arakan Army spokesman Khaing Thukha was quoted as saying by AFP news agency.
“We did not target the Indians but rather the MP,” he said.

Despite an influx of 15,000 Haitian immigrants, city's economy has improved with higher wages and stable crime rates. However concerns for the safety of Haitian Americans have arisen due to Trump's claim of immigrants eating pets.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (10 – 16 November 2019) - Cambodia | ReliefWeb
Cambodia+ 7 more
Last week, in Southeast Asia, key developments included: ongoing clashes between the military and ethnic armed groups in Myanmar; separatist violence against civilians in Thailand; continued clashes between state forces and the New People’s Army (NPA) in the Philippines; and labor protests in Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Clashes continued inMyanmarbetween the military and the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) in Rakhine state and between the military and the Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA) in Shan state. Both groups are members of the Northern Alliance, an alliance of four ethnic armed groups that have not signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). The government recently announced that peace talks with the alliance have been postponed for the foreseeable future (Myanmar Times, 14 November 2019).
Meanwhile, inThailand, suspected separatists reportedly shot and killed two civilians and injured one child in Pattani province. This comes after arrest warrants had been issued following the deadly 5 November attacks by separatists in Yala which left 15 dead (Benar News, 15 November 2019).
In thePhilippines, the government’s campaign against the communist New People’s Army (NPA) continued with six government soldiers and one NPA rebel reportedly killed in Eastern Samar. As “leftist organizations” continue to be targeted for alleged links to the NPA rebels in a practice known as “red-tagging,” many such organizations held a protest in Quezon City against the government’s ongoing harassment.
Labor protests were reported last week inCambodia,Malaysia,IndonesiaandThailand. In Cambodia, a two-day protest was held by textile factory workers angry over the firing of two workers for their union activities. Construction contractors in Thailand held a protest against the Department of Highways over unpaid expenses. Oil palm workers demonstrated for higher salaries in Sarawak in Malaysia. As well, protests took place in multiple locations in Indonesia calling for a higher minimum wage as the government set its budget for 2020 (ASEAN Briefing, 14 November 2019).
Finally, a rare protest was reported in **Vietnam **as police officers who participated in a housing scheme demonstrated when the houses they paid for were not constructed. A planned protest inLaosby pro-democracy activists was canceled as authorities detained the organizers. Critics of the government in Laos are often deemed to be threats to national security and face significant harassment for any political dissent (Human Rights Watch, 16 November 2019).

In Southeast Asia, key developments last week included: ongoing battles in Shan and Rakhine state in Myanmar; a slight increase in clashes between state forces and the New People’s Army in the Philippines; the death of two separatists in Thailand, alleged to be behind deadly attacks on security checkpoints earlier in the month; and demonstrations by farmers and laborers in Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines.
In Myanmar, battles between the military and the Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA) continued across Kutkai, Kyaukme and Namhsan townships in Shan state. The military and the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) likewise continued to clash across northern Rakhine state and southern Chin state. In both conflicts, artillery shells have frequently been falling in villages, causing civilian casualties.
Meanwhile, in the Philippines, the conflict between state forces and the New People’s Army (NPA) increased last week with the NPA also involved in a number of events in which they targeted civilians. As well, the Vice President of the Philippines, Leni Robredo, who only this month accepted President Duterte’s offer to serve on the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD), was fired from her position after Duterte accused her of bringing unwanted international attention to drug-related violence in the country (Channel News Asia, 25 November 2019). Robredo has been a strong critic of Duterte and his policies. Her firing is seen by many as proof that Duterte is not serious about making any changes to his anti-drug campaign; the “War on Drugs” is thus likely to continue with impunity (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 26 November 2019).
In Thailand, two suspected separatists behind the deadly 5 November attacks on security checkpoints in Yala were reportedly killed in a clash with the military in Pattani. The ongoing violence in the deep south has received attention from the Future Forward Party which has been critical of the military’s counter-insurgency operations in the deep south in addition to the military’s continued grip on power (Benar News, 17 October 2019). Last week, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of the Future Forward Party, was disqualified as MP after he was accused of violating election laws by holding shares in a media firm (BBC, 20 November 2019). Thanathorn has maintained the charges are politically motivated.
Finally, farmers and laborers protested across the Southeast Asia region last week. Protests over a lower than desired raise in the minimum wage were held in West, East and Central Java in Indonesia. Factory workers in Myanmar held a protest in the Yangon region over labor conditions and the harassment faced by the workers. Farmers in the Philippines demonstrated against rice liberalization laws, which have caused a decline in the price of rice. And, in Thailand, farmers demonstrated in Bangkok over land ownership issues.

Title: Indian worker taken hostage by Myanmar's Arakan Army dies; rebel group blames 'exhaustion' for 60-year-old's demise – Firstpost
This is the first time Arakan Army has captured foreign workers in Rakhine, which hosts a series of infrastructure projects linking India and Myanmar.
Yangon:A 60-year-old Indian national has died in Myanmar after being taken hostage with several other compatriots and a Myanmarese lawmaker by an ethnic rebel group in the country’s restive Rakhine province, media reports said on Monday.
Vinoo Gopal was among 10 people, including four Indians and U Whei Tin — a lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, abducted on Sunday by the Arakan Army from two boats while travelling from Paletwa in the Chin state to Kyauktaw in Rakhine, The Irrawaddy newspaper reported.
The Indian workers were part of the ongoing construction on the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transportation Project.
The incident about the death of the Indian worker came into limelight when the Arakan Army released eight people, including four Indians, two translators and two boat drivers, along with Gopal’s body at the Kyauktaw Police Station on Monday morning, the report said.
Two of the Indian survivors are employees of the Engineering Projects of India Ltd, while the three other Indians, including Gopal, were from the RPP Infra Projects, the paper reported.
The incident came into limelight a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a “constructive” meeting with Suu Kyi in Bangkok on the sidelines of the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The two leaders agreed that a stable and peaceful border was an important anchor for the continued expansion of the bilateral partnership.
Myanmar is one of India’s strategic neighbours and shares a 1,640-km-long border with a number of northeastern states including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur.
The Arakan Army is a Rakhine based insurgent group founded as the armed wing of the United League of Arakan (ULA). It has been fighting for almost a decade for greater autonomy of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.
This is the first time Arakan Army has captured foreign workers in the resource-rich area, which hosts a series of infrastructure projects linking India and Myanmar.
The rebels confirmed the Indian worker’s death as the group were marched up a hill.
“Unfortunately he suddenly died from exhaustion… we did not do anything to him,” Arakan Army spokesman Khaing Thukha was quoted as saying byAFPnews agency.
“We did not target the Indians but rather the MP,” he said.
Thukha said that they were not aware of the Indians on the boat.
“We keep detaining U Whei Tin as we still need to investigate him for security reasons…The Arakan Army did not intend to detain Indian civilians. Our troops did not know in advance that the Indian citizens were on the boats,” he told the paper.
The rebel group apologised for the death of Gopal.
The project with which Gopal and the four other Indians are attached is a joint project of India and Myanmar. The project, which will connect SittwePort in Myanmar to the India-Myanmar border, is expected to contribute to the economic development of the North-Eastern States of India, by opening up the sea route for the products.

Title: Indian worker part of Kaladan Project dies in custody of Myanmar insurgent group - India Today
Listen to Story
An Indian worker, part of the Kaladan project vital for the connectivity in North East, died in custody of the Arakan Army, an insurgent group in Myanmar, on Monday due to heart attack.
Five Indian workers, along with a Member of Myanmar Parliament and four other Myanmar nationals, were abducted by Arakan Army in the Rakhine State of Myanmar in the early hours of November 4.
While timely intervention ensured their release, the Indian worker died of a heart attack.
India Today had earlier reported about the threat to Kaladan Project and how the Indian Army along with the Myanmar Army had launched a massive two-week operation in February-March this year to secure the Kaladan project and push back the Arakan Army insurgents.
The Arakan Army, an insurgent group in Myanmar, has set up new bases along the Mizoram border targeting the Kaladan Project. The army is trained by Kachin Independence Army up North bordering China.
"On November 3, these five Indian nationals, along with a Member of Myanmar Parliament, two local transporters and two speedboat operators were abducted by Arakan Army on way from Paletwa in Chin State to Kyauktaw in Rakhine state in Myanmar. The abducted Indians were engaged in building the Kaladan road project in Myanmar. Unfortunately, one of the Indian national died in custody of the Arakan Army due to heart attack. According to information available, he was a chronic diabetes patient. The released Indian nationals, along with the dead body of the deceased, have reached Sittwe and will be leaving for Yangon today for onward journey to India, a statement from the Indian government said.
Kaladan project is a mega infrastructure plan to connect Kolkata to Mizoram via Sittwe port in Myanmar.
The transit project will connect Kolkata to Sittwe port in Myanmar and finally end up linking Mizoram. This will be a new gateway to the landlocked North East reducing the distance from Kolkata to Mizoram by nearly a thousand kilometres bringing down the travel time by at least four days.
Meanwhile, China has also been carrying out development projects at Kyaukpyu port near Sittwe.
In the recent times, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) that trains the Arakan Army in the Kachin State of Myanmar adjoining China, had readied around 3000 cadres that moved to the South closing in on areas adjoining the Lawngtlai district of Mizoram close to the Kaladan project site.Also Read |Operation Sunrise: India-Myanmar target insurgent groups camp in North EastAlso Watch |Surgical Strikes 3.0: Here's how Indian Army carried out mega operation against insurgent groupsPublished By:Akriti AnandPublished On:Nov 5, 2019--- ENDS ---

Myanmar military seizes large amount of arms, ammunition in fight with insurgents - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's armed forces have seized a large amount of arms and ammunition in Namsang township, northern Shan state, the Office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Services said on Sunday.
The seizure was made during an encounter between a military column and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) near Homein village on Friday.
As the TNLA withdrew after a brief fight, the military column conducted a detailed search and clearance in the area later on the day and found the large amount of arms and ammunition stored in three locations.
The weapons confiscated include portable air defense system, hand grenades, TNLA uniforms, assault rifles, machine guns, mortar rounds and propellants, and explosives.
TNLA is a non-signatory to the government's Nationwide Ceasefire Accord (NCA).

Title: Charity says land mine kills man in northern Myanmar | AP News
Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — A man was killed and a woman from Argentina was injured by a land mine explosion in northern Myanmar on Tuesday, a charity worker from the area said.
Ko Myo of Charity Without Borders, a nonprofit organization that provides ambulance services, said police in Hsipaw township in northern Shan state had his group take the two casualties to a hospital after the explosion.
Ko Myo said the dead man was a 40-year-old Dutch national. However, a spokeswoman for the Netherlands’ foreign ministry in The Hague said in a message to The Associated Press “as far as we know now, it is not a Dutch citizen.”
Neither the Hsipaw hospital nor Hsipaw police could be contacted for further details, including the victims’ names.
The U.S. State Department travel advisory for Myanmar, last revised in October, suggests people should not travel to Hsipaw and several other areas of Shan state “due to civil unrest and armed conflict.”
Myanmar is afflicted by intermittent fighting in border areas between government forces and guerrillas from various ethnic minorities that have been seeking greater autonomy for decades. Rebel groups in Shan state also occasionally battle each other. Myanmar is not a signatory of the global Mine Ban Treaty, and both government and rebel forces are reported to use land mines.
According to the 2019 Landmine & Cluster Munition Monitor, an extensive annual survey issued in conjunction with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Myanmar in 2018 recorded 430 land mine casualties, the fourth highest total in the world after Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen.
In April 2016, two German tourists and their local guide were wounded when they accidentally set off a land mine while trekking near Shan state’s Kyaukme township.

Myanmar parliament approves proposal to condemn abduction of ethnic parliamentarian - Xinhua | English.news.cn

NAY PYI TAW, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Union Parliament on Monday agreed to a proposal on condemning the abduction of an ethnic parliamentarian in western Chin state and demanding unconditional release of him.
The proposal, submitted by a parliamentarian of Mandalay constituency last Wednesday, said the Arakan Army (AA)'s lawless acts made no contribution to the efforts by the government and any organization in seeking national reconciliation and domestic peace.
U Wai Thin, ethnic Chin parliamentarian to the House of Nationalities (Upper House ), was kidnapped along with several other people involved in the Kaladan River project when they traveled from Paletwa to Kyauktaw on Nov. 3.
The missing of the parliamentarian was termed as violating the state security.
It was the first time that a parliament member went missing in Myanmar.
All the abductees have been reportedly released on the next day except U Wai Thin.
AA, a Rakhine ethnic insurgent group founded on April 10, 2009, is operating in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine and northern state of Kachin along with Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and is a non-signatory to the government's Nationwide Ceasefire Accord (NCA) already signed by 10 ethnic armed groups.

The transit project will connect Kolkata to Sittwe port in Myanmar and finally end up linking Mizoram. This will be a new gateway to the landlocked North East reducing the distance from Kolkata to Mizoram by nearly a thousand kilometres bringing down the travel time by at least four days.
Meanwhile, China has also been carrying out development projects at Kyaukpyu port near Sittwe.
In the recent times, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) that trains the Arakan Army in the Kachin State of Myanmar adjoining China, had readied around 3000 cadres that moved to the South closing in on areas adjoining the Lawngtlai district of Mizoram close to the Kaladan project site.Also Read |Operation Sunrise: India-Myanmar target insurgent groups camp in North EastAlso Watch |Surgical Strikes 3.0: Here's how Indian Army carried out mega operation against insurgent groupsPublished By:Akriti AnandPublished On:Nov 5, 2019--- ENDS ---

Title:  Bangkok Post - Nothing to celebrate at Kachin Thanksgiving
PUBLISHED : 28 Nov 2019 at 04:00
NEWSPAPER SECTION:News
WRITER:Carleton Cole
Four score minus seven years ago, on Abraham Lincoln's birthday, the leaders of four of Myanmar's main ethnic groups -- the majority Burmans, plus Kachin, Chin and Shan -- committed to creating a country conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal. The year before independence from Britain in 1948, the legacy Panglong Agreement created conditions for a multicultural country including "a separate Kachin State within a Unified Burma … [I]t is agreed that such a State is desirable".
Despite the reforms of recent years, the people of Myanmar are still waiting for the unified society agreed to in Panglong by Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San.
Desire to see the promise of Panglong materialise remains strong among the country's minorities, as well their sympathisers worldwide. These include the Free Burma Rangers (FBR), who provide humanitarian support to Myanmar's minorities and advocate for "freedom, justice and peace" while shedding light on the abuses of the Myanmar army. My fateful mountaintop encounter three years ago with FBR founder David Eubank, on my first trip to Kachin while on a frontline tour with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), provided the catalyst for my second trip last spring to this ruggedly beautiful land.
Instead of being invited to join a country in mutual respect and equality, Myanmar's ethnic minorities have for decades faced a relentless onslaught of abuse culminating in persecution of the Rohingya, described two years ago by the UN human rights chief as a "textbook example" of ethnic cleansing.
While the UN has advised penalising the country's military with "financial isolation", the international community has utterly failed to curb the generals' ferocious exploitation of the country's considerable natural resources. Instead, the biggest move by any nation has been China's investment for its Belt and Road Initiative, while simultaneously colluding with Myanmar's military to extract maximum gain from resources-rich Kachin state.
Like Lincoln, Gen Aung San was martyred while leading a country through reconciliation in the wake of a bitter history. "Now he belongs to the ages," wrote then-US Secretary of State William Seward after Lincoln's assassination, in an epitaph that also applies to Myanmar's founding father.
"Aung San was not the leader of the Burmese only; he was the leader of the Kachins also," surmised Sama Duwa Sinwa Nawng, a Kachin negotiator at Panglong.
"He was one of us. I used to tell him, 'Bogyoke [General], you must be a Kachin. You are truthful and given to plain, even blunt speaking, as we are. It was largely because the Kachins and the frontier peoples trusted Aung San that they joined the national movement for freedom. We peoples were near, yet circumstances had kept us apart in history. Bogyoke brought us together, made us a family again. He was humble and unassuming."
Largely converted to Christianity in the late 1800s, the Kachin, who make up about 1% of Myanmar's population of 53 million, were at the same time introduced to America's tradition of Thanksgiving. Armed with weapons forged within their remote fortress-capital of Laiza, on the border with China, the Kachin have fought a largely undocumented struggle for almost seven decades. In 2011, a 17-year ceasefire collapsed when Myanmar aggression reignited the world's longest ongoing civil war as government soldiers drove 100,000 Kachin residents from their homes.
President Lincoln's Thanksgiving Proclamation, delivered in November 1863 "[i]n the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity", sanctified the fourth Thursday of each November, in a nation in need of "the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility, and union".
The proclamation's spirit of freedom and atonement also flows through its sister declaration, the Gettysburg Address delivered by Lincoln a month later, the slavery-abolishing Emancipation Proclamation of the same year, as well as the Panglong Agreement this century.
As then Burma was on the verge of freeing itself from British and then Japanese colonial aggression at the end of World War II, Gen Aung San told his compatriots, "We are now fighting to win peace, not the kind of peace of a graveyard but a living peace with a future. It must be the kind of peace that fosters progress, prosperity, freedom and equity. Otherwise it will neither be just nor durable."
Among the main conclusions reached in the recent EU-supported report, The Hidden War, is that "The hidden war behind the formal visible armed conflict, is the intensive war that nowadays takes place against the IDPs [Internally Displaced Peoples] in Kachin and Northern Shan states. This is taking place by the impoverishment imposed on them through the reduced food supply and basic services, the violation and abuse of human rights, the cut in education opportunities, and ongoing exploitation of their natural resources... The majority of IDPs are not confident about recovering their rights or being able to express their ethnic identity, political thoughts and participate in social life." These sentiments echo loudly in dozens of conversations I have had with students, teachers, soldiers, civil society workers and other Kachin working to support the continued existence of their imperilled society.
While the Union's victory in the civil war secured a future of freedom in the United States, the fall of the strategic KIA outpost of Gidon to Mynamar troops in 2016 indicates a looming victory for government oppression that hides behind simplistic claims of eliminating separatists.
The Kachin and other ethnic groups of Myanmar are disillusioned by the neo-democratic Myanmar regime of today, in which peace efforts have stagnated along with hope of a government truly of the people, by the people, for the people.
In his greatest speech, America's greatest leader eternally reminds us to remain attentive to the "unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced", lauding the army destined to become destroyers of slavery, and invoking a moral authority that could just as easily been applied to Native Americans battling European invaders, or Kachin defying Myanmar aggression.
"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and … shall not perish from the earth."

Title: Once Bitten, Twice Shy: Myanmar's Kachin IDPs Demand Ceasefire Before Returning Home - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
ByNYEIN NYEIN
MYITKYINA – Armed clashes have become less common this year in Myanmar’s northern Kachin State between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the military’s Northern Command. Both sides are trying to agree on a bilateral ceasefire agreement that would let internally displaced Kachin residents return home.
Villagers began fleeing their homes more than eight years ago.
“When there is a tangible ceasefire, bringing peace, we will go back immediately. If there is safety for us in our village, we are going back, whatever challenges lie ahead,” said Daw Ja Htu from N Wan Kawng Village, which is east of Waingmaw.
The area is under the control of the New Democratic Army – Kachin (NDA-K), a faction of the KIA that turned into a Kachin Border Guard Force, led by ex-Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) officers Zahkung Ting Ying, Layawk Zelum and Ying Zelum since 1989.
It is only two hours’ drive from Waingmaw to Sadone, but the villagers fear for their safety if they return. The road leads to the Chinese border and is a major trade route, exporting bananas from Waingmaw and importing numerous goods from China.
When Daw Ja Htu fled in June 2012 amid fighting between the KIA and forces backed by the Tatmadaw (military), she thought it would only be temporary.
Since then she has been in the Mung Na Baptist Church internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Waingmaw, supported by the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC). After eight years in a camp, Daw Ja Htu says her farmland and orchards will be heavily overgrown.
The Mung Na IDP camp hosts 2,833 people, who have fled 39 villages across Bhamo, Momauk, Tanai, Hpakant, Injangyang, Chipwi, Waingmaw and Myitkyina townships since June 2012.
The KIO has been engaged in revolutionary struggle for six decades—since 1961. A ceasefire in 1994 was regarded as a partial success.
But in June 2011, the ceasefire between the KIA and the military government broke down and since then nearly 120,000 people have been forced to shelter in 170 camps in northern Shan and Kachin states.
Along with its allies in the Northern Alliance—the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Arakan Army and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army—the KIA is trying to reach a bilateral ceasefire agreement with the National League for Democracy-led government. The latest talks on Sept. 17 in Kengtung focused on agreements between the government and each armed group, and the return of the IDPs.
But further talks with the Northern Alliance were postponed. In mid-October, chairman N’Ban La of the KIO, the political wing of the KIA, met government peace negotiators in the Thai city of Chiang Mai todiscussa ceasefire agreement and the return of the displaced.
Efforts to smooth out the IDP returns were first suggested in mid-2017 when Kachin Baptist Convention leaders met State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
Since early this year, the Kachin Humanitarian Concern Committee led by the KBC has beenworkingwith the government on pilot projects to be able to return the displaced villagers. But little other work is being conducted to return villagers to their homes.
IDPs demand safety after returning
Daw Ze Nyoi from Gang Dau Yang Village south of Waingmaw said she wants a tranquil life in her village. But they fear renewed clashes.
“We fled with only the clothes on our backs. Now, after eight years, we have got some belongings and want to resume our lives. But what if the fighting restarts? We don’t want to flee again,” she said from the Janmai Kawng IDP camp.
Her village and those of many other IDPs are close to Laiza, which hosts the KIO’s headquarters in southern Waingmaw Township. They said their biggest fear is renewed fighting before a ceasefire is agreed.
She added: “We are told anyone can return voluntarily. But we want guarantees … We hear [the government and KIA] hold meetings but they must prove to us there have been results so we can return.”
The visibly distressed Daw Ja Htu from Mung Na IDP camp added: “There is no hope. I don’t have anything to say or cannot think of any hope. There is no hope for our family’s future.”
Good old days
Many of the Kachin IDPs, who fled after June 2011, are farmers who once grew rice or tended orchards.
Children have grown up with no knowledge of village life with its ample space and tranquility. Daw Ze Nyoi, who has three children, sees families losing their experience of rural life.
Her family grew oranges, paddy and vegetables. She earned enough to send her children to study. Since 2016, she said, many teenagers have dropped out of school, as their parents could not fund their education.
In Janmai Kawng IDP camp, Daw Ze Nyoi said dozens of teenagers had abandoned their education, but there were no jobs for them.
In their villages, they could have worked on the farms and orchards. “We don’t blame them nor blame ourselves, because this situation is out of our control,” she added.
Hardship ahead
For all the longing to go back home, uncertainty awaits those who can return.
Under a pilot project, some IDPs have returned to their homes, such in Nam Sang Yang Village in Waingmaw Township.
“We don’t have a plan to go back,” said Daw Khon Naw from Nam Sang Yang, who is sheltering at the Janmai Kawng Baptist Church camp in Myitkyina.
Janmai Kawng IDP camp has been supported by the KBC since July 2011 and hosts more than 1,000 people from 17 villages from Myitkyina, Waingmaw, Hpakant and Sumprabum townships.
She said: “Even though it looks like good news that people are going back, we heard from [returnees] that they are facing difficulties. They told us they were wrong to go back. They were promised government support for six months but there has been nothing.”
Fighting must stop and armed groups must actively help the process, said Gum Sha Awng, the director of Metta Development Foundation. He urged the Tatmadaw and the KIA to consider the people’s needs.
“At least the ceasefire agreement should have been agreed between them. It is important to end the current conflict. The government should increase basic support—such as health care and education—to the IDPs while international aid is falling,” he said.
He added that the concerns of losing customary land tenure under the 2018 Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Law was pushing villagers to go back despite the risks.
In Waingmaw, land disputes related to banana plantations are widespread. The IDPs fear their land will be seized for agricultural projects without their knowledge.
Life in an IDP camp
IDPs are often forced to be idle in the crowded camps.
During our short visits, The Irrawaddy witnessed the distress of many IDPs, who do not have anything to do in the compound. A few of them get an income outside the camps for unskilled work as cleaners or farmers on banana or other plantations.
Daw Sawng Nam, a 47-year-old mother of six children, is from Ta Pa Daung Village in Waingmaw. She is now confined to the Janmai Kawng IDP camp in Myitkyina. She works as a mason in Myitkyina for 2,000 kyats (US$1.30) per day.
“It is not enough to feed the family but what can we do? We have this job only for this year and it is not even regular work,” she said.
Her village can be reached within a day but she dare not return. “We cannot stay because the government forces are deployed in the area. We have six children and it is not safe.”
Since 2016, the camp residents are only supplied enough cash to buy the rice, oil and salt that was previously provided by the World Food Programme. Older residents and single parents receive 15,000 kyats per month and families with both parents receive 11,000 kyats.
The cash is only enough to keep people alive, said Daw Ze Nyoi from Gang Dau Yang Village in southern Waingmaw.
Unemployment and trafficking to China are the problems which need urgent attention, added Gum Sha Awng.
Many of the displaced villagers told The Irrawaddy that the lack of work is their toughest challenge.
