Title: Myanmar's Arakan Army is Recruiting and Training to Fight Government
By Steve Sandford October 16, 2019
On the edge of a mountainside in Northern Myanmar's Kachin state, several hundred young army recruits kick up the dust as they jog down a trail during early morning military drills.
New recruits are joining groups such as the Arakan Army which has set up training camps in Kachin state, home to fellow Northern Alliance member, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).
The Arakan Army (AA) formed in 2009 and is currently fighting in Rakhine State against government forces in ongoing skirmishes that have escalated in recent months, amid faltering cease-fire talks.
The AA is the armed wing of the United League of Arakan, headquartered in Laiza. Laiza is the capital of KIA - controlled Kachin State, bordering China.
The Arakan Army say that they have a current force of 7,000 troops.
Like most of the ethnic armed groups within the country who haven't signed peace agreements, the Arakan army say they are fighting for more self-autonomy and control over their territory.
"The reason I joined the Arakan Army and train as a female soldier is because I don't want to see the Myanmar army oppress and kill Rakhine people anymore," says female recruit Soe Soe, as she slings an AK-74 over her shoulder.
"The Myanmar army bullies and treats us badly in every way they can. I can't take it so I made a decision to serve my nationality and army."
Like the other armed groups in their Northern Alliance, comprised of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) the Ta-ang Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Arakan Army is in the midst of some heavy fighting as ongoing ceasefire negotiations with the Aung San Suu Kyi - led government and Myanmar military stumble forward.
International investment and regional development has driven up land values and increased pressure on warring groups to bring peace and stability to territory that contains revenue-earning resources or serves as corridors to deliver the goods.
The Arakan Army's Deputy commander, Dr. Nyo Tun Aung, who also overseas the medic training at the Laiza - based camp, says that the Rohingya Muslims aren't the only group under attack in Rakhine State.
"When there were problems with Bengali in Rakhine State the world paid attention and had sympathy for them," Nyo Tun Aung explains. "We want to beg the world please look at what's happened to the Arakan people and feel for us too. We're also in the same situation like the Bengali."
Rohingya
The Rohingya Muslim population in Rakhine State is often referred to as Bengali by the Burmese population, a derogatory term insinuating that they come from neighboring Bangladesh.
More than 750,000 Rohingya were driven out of Rakhine State during an army clearance operation by Myanmar forces in 2017.
Now, more than 900,000 remain in Bangladesh refugee camps and top Myanmar officials are under investigation by international rights groups for crimes against humanity.
Despite the majority of the Rakhine state's civilian population being predominately Buddhist ethnic Rakhine, the locals have still been a target of the central Burmese army.
Key economic zones under development in Rakhine State - and funded by China and India - have already led to massive displacement of both the Buddhist and Muslim populations.
The US $484 million Kaladan project plans to connect Sittwe port with the eastern Indian seaport of Kolkata while China is backing a deep sea port in Kyaukphyu, estimated at US $1.3 billion.
A $1.5 billion oil pipeline will also run from the Bay of Bengal to China.
While the pipelines and deep sea ports will provide oil and gas to neighboring countries, the local population has yet to see the benefits.
"One day I stand on top of the mountain. I look down to the capital and I see their lights all over the city but when I look back to our village I hope to see the lights but what I see is only the darkness," says AA Second Lieutenant Kyaw Than, on the sidelines of the training camp.
In addition to the lack of electricity in parts of the state, the civilian population is also facing blockage of internet services.
In June 2019, Myanmar's government shut down the internet in nine townships - eight in Rakhine State and one in Chin State - impeding humanitarian aid, business, media access, and human rights monitoring, according to a Fortify Rights report, a human rights group with a focus on Asia.
In justifying the shutdown, Telenor Group said the Ministry of Transport and Communications cited "disturbances of peace and use of internet services to coordinate illegal activities, cited the report.
"A blackout on internet access for civilians creates an enabling environment for human rights violations," said Fortify Rights' Matthew Smith.
"Instead of limiting communication, the Myanmar and Bangladesh authorities should be facilitating access for humanitarian aid workers, journalists, and human rights monitors to civilians in need," Smith added.
Meanwhile, counter-terrorism charges filed by the Myanmar Police Force against four Arakan Army leaders for attacks on police posts in Rakhine state earlier this year, remain outstanding - as ceasefire talks continue with the ethnic groups.
The charges against members of the AA, are the first in which any ethnic leaders have been charged under the country's Counter-Terrorism Law
If convicted, the AA leaders face three to seven years in jail with or without a fine under the law's Section 52(a), according to Myanmar press.
Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's Union Minister for the Office of the State Counsellor, said that Rohingya repatriation is still on the table, even as the ongoing conflicts continue.
"Our priority now is to expedite repatriation and to create a more conducive environment for verified returnees," he stated, during a September 28 UN General Assembly meeting.
Meanwhile Cease-fire talks continue between government forces and the various ethnic armed groups with hopes of finding common ground.
"Our main goal to fight is we want the equality and self determination," reiterates AA Deputy commander Nyo Tun Aung.
"This is outstanding point and policy from our organization. We want to be able to have our own Arakan State future."

Title: Deaths reported after rebels abduct dozens in Myanmar’s Rakhine | Conflict News | Al Jazeera
Arakan Army rebel group says three military helicopters attacked three boats carrying kidnapped troops and two sank.
An ethnic rebel army inMyanmarsaid some of the several dozen soldiers, police and civilian officials it abducted from a ferry were killed in a subsequent attack by government helicopters.
A statement posted on Sunday on the website of the Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group in the western state of Rakhine, said three helicopters attacked three boats carrying the captured personnel after they were seized on Saturday, sinking two.




It said some captives and members of its rebel force were killed. The claim could not immediately be confirmed.
An Information Ministry statement said earlier that 58 people had been abducted by about 30 Arakan Army members from the boat carrying 165 civilian passengers and about 50 government personnel from Rakhine’s capital, Sittwe, north to Buthidaung.



A statement issued on Sunday night on the website of Myanmar’s military commander-in-chief acknowledged helicopters had been sent to try and rescue the abductees.
It said the helicopters suffered some damage from gunfire and a crewman was lightly wounded, while at least 14 people who had been kidnapped were rescued.
The report did not specifically refer to an attack on boats or casualties among the abductees.
TheArakan Armysays it is seeking self-determination. It represents the Buddhist Rakhine inhabitants of Rakhine state, and is one of more than a dozen ethnic minorities in Myanmar seeking autonomy.
The abduction on Saturday was the second carried out in recent weeks by the AA, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist local majority.
Earlier this month, suspected rebels disguised as sports players boarded a bus in the state and took dozens of firefighters and civilians hostage.
The AA has been engaged in increasingly fierce fighting with government forces since late last year, eclipsingRohingyaarmed groups, who have been largely inactive since late 2017.
The military in 2017 waged a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine, causing more than 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
The army and other security forces were accused of major abuses, including organised rape, murder and the burning of villages, that a UN-appointed investigation has called ethnic cleansing.
The UN and independent groups sayhuman rights violationshave increased as the government battles the Arakan Army, with the government side blamed for most, but not all, of the abuses.



The Arakan Army has been especially aggressive in its attacks and has active alliances with several other armed ethnic rebel groups, helping it keep the government off-balance by staging joint attacks in other areas of the country.
In August, it staged co-ordinated attacks with its allies at five locations, including a military academy outside normal combat areas, where a civilian was killed and a soldier wounded.
The alliance with the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, representing the Palaung minority, and the Kokang minority’s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army also claimed responsibility for attacks in Myanmar’s central Mandalay region in Northern Shan state, where 14 people were reported killed.
Since becoming independent from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has been wracked by fighting with minority groups in border areas seeking greater autonomy from the central government.

YANGON: Myanmar's army said it had rescued 14 people seized by insurgents in restive Rakhine state after Arakan Army rebels reported many dead in military attacks on boats carrying soldiers and police said it had taken prisoners.
The escalation in bloodshed is one of the biggest in the western state since fighting intensified early this year between the army and the rebels demanding greater autonomy for Rakhine.
"Of those abducted by the Arakan Army, 14 people have now been rescued," the military said in a statement late on Sunday. "The military is continuing a combined air and land operation to rescue the remaining people abducted as soon as possible."

Title: Stray Myanmar Artillery Injures Villagers in Northern Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG
A mother and her 12-year-old daughter were wounded by artillery in Kutkai Township, northern Shan State, amid fighting between Myanmar’s army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
Ze Nyoi suffered a head injury and Lashi Mai Mai, her daughter, was wounded in her right leg, which was bleeding heavily. She was treated at Kutkai Hospital.
Mawhan village tract has eight villages and 200 houses.
Mawhan Kachin Baptist Church helped the two members of its congregation receive treatment.
Fighting was reported at a mountain near the village of Namh Wei yesterday between the Myanmar army and TNLA, according to church leader Daw Jau Seng Aung. She told The Irrawaddy that three artillery shells fell on Pado Phaka Village Thursday evening.
Government forces from Tar Moe Nyar reportedly fired the artillery in support of troops trying to take a TNLA hilltop stronghold near Namh Wei, she added.
Some shells from Tar Moe Nyar and Kutkai missed their target and injured villagers. “The artillery shells did not come from the fighting area. They came from Tar Moe Nyar,” Daw Jau Seng Aung said.
Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for Myanmar’s military in Naypyitaw, told The Irrawaddy that there was fighting today and yesterday in Kutkai. But he reported that the fighting was at a different time from the TNLA.
He also denied the army was responsible for the artillery attack on Pado Phaka.
The TNLA said a half-hour clash broke out in Namh Wei yesterday evening during fighting to take the rebel group’s hilltop outpost.
Some Namh Wei villagers left their homes this morning to avoid more artillery strikes while others hid in the village bunker.
Major Tar Aike Kyaw from the TNLA told The Irrawaddy that government artillery in Kutkai was targeting the TNLA base this morning.
The TNLA stopped traffic this morning to prevent injuries from the artillery, said Maj. Tar Aike Kyaw.
Three separate battles occurred in Namkham and Kutkai townships, according to the TNLA.
The armed group is a member of the Brotherhood Alliance, which announced a ceasefire last month until the end of the year.
However, the TNLA says Myanmar’s army has attacked its base 10 times since the ceasefire was announced.

Title: Myanmar Army Shoots Rakhine Man Dead And Is Accused of Rights Abuses in Shan State

2019-10-02 -- Myanmar soldiers shot dead a villager in northern Rakhine state's Kyauktaw township after he failed to stop his motorbike as ordered for a security check in the war-ravaged area, residents and an army spokesman said.
Soe Naing, 40, who lived in the township's Apauk Wa village, was shot near Cardi village around 5 a.m. while heading to Kyauktaw town, after he did not obey the troops' order, a Cardi resident said on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.
"I learned that he passed through around 5 a.m.," Cardi villager said. "There were troops stationed briefly in the village, and they told him not to ride off, but he kept on driving and was shot after rousing suspicion."
Local residents heard the soldiers order Soe Naing to stop and then the sound of gunfire, he said,
Soe Naing was heading to work at the Laywaddy bus terminal in Kyauktaw, a distance of about 10 miles from his home, when the incident occurred, they said.
Nyi Pu, president of the Phyuzin Metta charity group in Kyauktaw, said his workers have yet been allowed to claim Soe Naing's body.
"Together with some leading members of the funeral service, we arranged to claim the body after reporting the incident to local officials and to the police, but then we were not allowed to claim it," he told RFA's Myanmar Service. "We expect to get permission after the army hands it over to the police."
Brigadier General Win Zaw Oo, spokesman for the military's Western Regional Command responsible for Rakhine state, said the shooting occurred around 4:30 a.m. and that Soe Naing was carrying gear that could link him to rebels.
"He got shot incidentally after security forces fired warning shots when he didn't stop and rode off," he said about Soe Naing.
During a search of Soe Naing, an ethnic Rakhine villager, and his motorbike, soldiers found a detonator and batteries that could be used for making improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the brigadier general said.
"He was found with Sony nine-volt batteries, so we have to consider that he was probably involved with [rebels]," he said.
RFA was unable to verify the veracity of Win Zaw Oo's claim.
The Myanmar Army has been engaged in heavy combat in northern Rakhine state with the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic military fighting for greater autonomy in the region, since late 2018.
The AA has frequently attacked Myanmar forces with IEDs along roads in Ponnagyun, Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U, and Minbya townships. Myanmar forces believe that some ethnic Rakhine villagers are assisting the rebel group in its efforts.
RFA could not reach AA spokesman Khine Thukha for comment.
Third incident
The shooting incident marks the third time that Myanmar soldiers have shot dead motorbike riders who did not stop at checkpoints.
Myanmar soldiers shot and killed an ethnic Rakhine ethnic civilian on the outskirts of Sittwe township in early August because he did not heed orders to stop his motorbike at a checkpoint during the curfew.
In late July, troops shot to death an NGO worker as he rode his motorbike through Mrauk-U town and failed to immediately stop at a checkpoint when ordered to do so.
Win Zaw Oo pointed out that a dusk-to-dawn curfew order issued on April 2 remains in place in Rathedaung, Ponnagyun, Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U and Minbya townships Rakhine state, and that local residents must comply with it.
"There will be frequent checking activities in military operation areas, and there should be no problem and difficulties should they accept the situation," he said.
Maung Than Sein, a regional lawmaker from Kyauktaw township, said the curfew, imposed in line with Section 144 of Myanmar's Criminal Code in five northern Rakhine to maintain law and order, does not necessarily allow security officials to shoot dead those who violate it.
"The law doesn't say to open fire for violating the Section 144," he said. "You can't shoot someone on a motorbike for violating the Section 144. Local residents said he left home after 5 a.m., and his parents said so too."
The curfew was enacted in response to the intensifying armed conflict between the Myanmar Army and the AA.

Rights violations in northern Shan state
In a related development, 10 ethnic Ta'ang men have died and about 70 others have suffered rights violations in five townships during the past three months amid fighting in northern Shan state between the Myanmar military and ethnic armies, according to a local rights group.
Officials from the Ta'ang Women's Organization (TWO) said Wednesday that the killings and most of the other violations occurred in Kutkai, Nansang, Kyaukme, Hsipaw, and Namhkam townships, where most of the region's ethnic Ta'ang (Palaung) minority group lives.
TWO spokeswoman Lue Chi Sa Nga said the Myanmar military and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) committed most of the rights violations.
The RCSS and its armed wing, the Shan State Army-South, have clashed with other ethnic armies in northern Shan state, including the Ta'ang National Liberation Front (TNLA), usually over violations of designated territory.
The Myanmar military was responsible for 15 instances of rights violations, while a local militia the RCSS/SSA-S, and the TNLA were responsible for five other cases, the TWO said.
"Our records show that most of the rights violations have been committed by the military," Lue Chi Sa Nga told RFA. "With the remaining cases, we cannot clearly decide who the offenders were, whether they were from the military or ethnic armed groups."
The most common rights violations by the national military include forced labor and civilian deaths and injuries from shell explosions, she said.
Most of the civilians who experienced right violations live in areas where the military and ethnic armed groups engaged in armed conflict, the TWO said.
TWO officials said the number of instances of rights violations committed by ethnic armed groups increased from July until the end of September, and included detentions, abductions, forced labor, shellings and howitzer attacks, the use of landmines, and seizing and destroying civilian property.
TWO's records show that 10 civilians were killed and 23 injured by landmines and shell explosions, while 23 were forcibly taken as guides, three were detained, 10 were forcibly recruited as new soldiers, and one was tortured.
'Snap decisions'
Mai Myo Aung from Ta'ang Legal Aid said members of the organization have witnessed several instances of rights violations committed by armed groups.
"Currently, we have seen the continuous rights violations in the region, with or without armed conflicts," she told RFA. "For example, we received reports that the local militia has detained and beaten a local civilian in Namhkam township. This one was obvious. We have seen many similar cases where we can't identify the offenders."
Myanmar military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said the armed forces is addressing rights violation reports
"We have to make snap decisions during the armed conflicts, so they won't be flawless," he said. "If there were rights violations, the Tatmadaw [Myanmar military] has been working to address them accordingly."
"We try to abide as much as possible with international standards, guidelines, and ethics regarding human rights," he said.
RCSS spokesman Deputy Colonel Sai Oo said the rebel army has not forcibly recruited civilians into its ranks.
"We have movements in those areas, but we didn't commit any forced recruitments," he told RFA. "We provide human rights education to all of our low-ranking soldiers. Their supervisors are also overseeing them to avoid any violations. "
Besides the number of known case of rights violation in northern Shan state, many others are likely unreported, TWO said.

Title: Myanmar military continues committing atrocities against ethnic minorities, says Amnesty 
The Myanmar military is continuing to wage fresh atrocities against ethnic minorities in the conflict-riven north of the country, according to a new report by human rights group Amnesty International.
The report details harrowing accounts of ethnic Kachin, Lisu, Shan and Ta’ang civilians being arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured by the armed forces.
It also sheds a light on abusive tactics used by ethnic armed groups as they confront the military and fight among themselves to exert control over Shan State, a region rich in mineral resources and also part of the Golden Triangle where much of the world’s opium and heroin is illegally produced.
“The Myanmar military is as relentless and ruthless as ever, committing war crimes against civilians in northern Shan State with absolute impunity,” alleged Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southeast Asia.
“Soldiers – and more importantly commanders – are subjecting civilians to the military’s hallmark brutality in the absence of any form of accountability.”
Alongside Rakhine – the home of the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority - the largely Buddhist and Christian Kachin and Shan states have also seen decades of internal conflict.
Kachin insurgents, including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), have fought with government soldiers for more autonomy since 1961, and frequently clashed with the military in Shan state.
Human rights experts have spoken of a pattern of abuses by Myanmar regiments, including detaining and torturing men and boys on the basis of their ethnicity.
In one incident described in the report, soldiers detained and tortured two ethnic Kachin villagers who had been fishing in Shan’s Kutkai Township in March.
“[A soldier asked] ‘Are you KIA?’ I said ‘no’, then they started punching and kicking me. They forced me to take off my clothes [and] held a knife to my neck,” said one of the men.
“Then they forced me to squat with my fingers on my knees… They told me if I moved they would cut off my fingers… They put a grenade in my mouth… I was afraid if I moved it would explode.”
Civilian witnesses told Amnesty that the military’s notorious 99thLight Infantry Division were involved in many violations.
The battle-hardened counter-insurgency force has a reputation for ruthlessness and its units were implicated in some of the worst atrocities that drove over 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh, where they now languish in squalid refugee camps.
The report also accuses ethnic armed groups of “heinous abuses” including abduction and forced labour. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes over the last year as fighting moves closer to villages, it said.
The Myanmar government did not respond to a request for comment.

Myanmar: Military atrocities ‘relentless and ruthless’ in northern Shan State
Amnesty International has gathered fresh evidence that the Myanmar military is continuing to commit atrocities against ethnic minorities in the north of the country, with civilians bearing the brunt of offensives against multiple armed groups. The conflicts show no sign of abating, raising the prospect of further violations.
A new report,“Caught in the middle”: Abuses against civilians amid conflict in Myanmar’s northern Shan State, details the harrowing conditions of civilians arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured by the military. It also highlights the abusive tactics used by ethnic armed groups as they confront the military and each other to exert control in the region.
“The Myanmar military is as relentless and ruthless as ever, committing war crimes against civilians in northern Shan State with absolute impunity,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southeast Asia. “Soldiers – and more importantly commanders – are subjecting civilians to the military’s hallmark brutality in the absence of any form of accountability.”
Amnesty International documented war crimes and other military violations against ethnic Kachin, Lisu, Shan, and Ta’ang civilians during two field missions to the region in March and August 2019.
Civilians who spoke to Amnesty International repeatedly implicated the military’s 99th Light Infantry Division (LID) in many of the violations. Units from the 99th LID were implicated in some of the worstatrocities against the Rohingyain Rakhine State since August 2017, as well as inwar crimesand other serious violations in northern Myanmar in 2016 and early 2017.
“Wherever the 99th Light Infantry Division is deployed we see similar patterns of abuse and the commission of horrific crimes unfold. This highlights the urgency of international action to hold Myanmar’s military – not least its senior generals – accountable.”
Violations have continued even after the military announced a unilateral ceasefire, since lapsed, in December 2018. A recent escalation of fighting in the region – which the government has linked to illegal drug trafficking but which ethnic armed groups attribute to ongoing military offensives – has brought new reports of violations. Meanwhile, progress on the country’s stalled peace process looks unlikely as all sides gear up for general elections in 2020.
Myanmar soldiers have committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in the last year, particularly in the northernmost townships of Shan State. These have continued even after the military’s announcement of a unilateral ceasefire in the area on 21 December 2018.
Soldiers have detained civilians – overwhelmingly men and boys – often torturing or subjecting them to other forms of ill-treatment. Most were accused of having links to specific armed groups based solely on their ethnicity, a sign of the climate of suspicion, discrimination and arbitrary punishment that Kachin, Shan, Ta’ang and other ethnic minority communities face at the hands of the Myanmar military. The military has also fired indiscriminately in civilian areas, killing and injuring civilians and damaging homes and other property.
On 11 March 2019, soldiers from the 99th LID detained and tortured two ethnic Kachin villagers in Kutkai Township. While the men were away fishing, fighting broke out between the military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). One of the men, 35, recalled what happened when they encountered the group of soldiers:
“[A soldier asked] ‘Are you KIA?’ I said ‘no’, then they started punching and kicking me. They forced me to take off my clothes [and] held a knife to my neck… Then they forced me to squat with my fingers on my knees… They told me if I moved they would cut off my fingers… They put a grenade in my mouth… I was afraid if I moved it would explode.”
In some cases, detainees were taken to military bases where they were held incommunicado for up to three months and denied access to family and lawyers. In one case documented by Amnesty International, an 18-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy were subjected to forced labour, including digging trenches, while being held at a military base in the town of Kutkai.
Before being taken to the base the 18-year-old was beaten, then tortured further. He said: “They asked if I was a [KIA] soldier… I kept saying no, then they put a plastic bag over my head [and] tied it tight by holding it in the back. They were asking me if I knew any soldiers from the village. They did it six or seven times, each time for two or three minutes. I couldn’t breathe.”
Civilians are increasingly caught between ethnic armed groups who abduct, detain and sometimes torture men and boys, often accusing them of supporting a rival armed group. Amnesty International documented such abuses by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), the Shan State Army-South (SSA-S), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
Armed groups have also subjected civilians to forced labour. Amnesty International documented several instances when civilians were forced to work as porters, carry fighters’ belongings and guide them to other villages during active combat, putting their lives at risk. Civilians also told Amnesty International that armed groups regularly extort food and money from them, threatening anyone who refuses with physical violence.
“Armed groups are responsible for heinous abuses against civilians, including abductions, forced labour and beatings. We are calling on all sides to stop targeting civilians, and to take all possible measures to keep fighting away from populated areas,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
Thousands have been forced to flee their homes in the last year as the fighting moves closer to villages. Many people have been displaced multiple times. One women told Amnesty International she had fled her home four times in March 2019 alone.
Villagers often flee to makeshift displacement sites such as churches and monasteries, where they stay until the fighting moves to a different area. These short-term displacements can make it difficult for humanitarian workers to access people in need, made worse by government and military restrictions on humanitarian access.
Even those who flee are not safe, with an alarming increase since 2018 in the number of civilians killed or injured by landmines or improvised explosive devices.
Amnesty International is calling on all sides to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, protect civilians, and ensure humanitarian access. Armed groups must end acts of violence and intimidation against civilians and take all feasible measures to avoid civilian-populated areas.
“Those responsible for war crimes should face justice, all the way up to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the Myanmar military’s Commander-in-Chief,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Fighters and commanders in ethnic armed groups should also be investigated and held accountable for war crimes.”
“For too long the UN Security Council has stood by as civilians were abandoned to a ceaseless cycle of violence. It is time for the Council to stop dragging its feet and refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.”

2 policemen killed in convoy attack by insurgents in western Myanmar - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- At lease two policemen have been killed with five other policemen and two women civilians injured as the local insurgent Arakan Army (AA) attacked a police convoy in Myanmar's western Rakhine state, police said on Friday.
The convoy was made up of a prison van and a police vehicle.
The prison van carried 14 policemen and 20 inmates, while the police vehicle carried civilians of eight men and two women.
The 10-member AA group attacked the convoy by setting off two remote-controlled mines on Thursday afternoon on Buthidaung-Maungtaw road in Buthidaung township.
The policemen escorting the prison van returned fire, forcing the AA members to retreat.
The inmates were sent to the Buthidaung Prison and the security forces are conducting security measures around the site of the attack, police added.
On Aug. 20, AA launched similar mine attack on a police convoy on Yangon-Sittway road in the same state, killing three police members and injuring three others.
Arakan Army (AA) is a Rakhine rebel group fighting for the rights of ethnic Rakhine people in Myanmar. It usually fights alongside the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) against the Myanmar Armed Forces.

Title: Myanmar's Arakan Army is Recruiting and Training to Fight Government
By Steve Sandford October 16, 2019
On the edge of a mountainside in Northern Myanmar's Kachin state, several hundred young army recruits kick up the dust as they jog down a trail during early morning military drills.
New recruits are joining groups such as the Arakan Army which has set up training camps in Kachin state, home to fellow Northern Alliance member, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).
The Arakan Army (AA) formed in 2009 and is currently fighting in Rakhine State against government forces in ongoing skirmishes that have escalated in recent months, amid faltering cease-fire talks.
The AA is the armed wing of the United League of Arakan, headquartered in Laiza. Laiza is the capital of KIA - controlled Kachin State, bordering China.
The Arakan Army say that they have a current force of 7,000 troops.
Like most of the ethnic armed groups within the country who haven't signed peace agreements, the Arakan army say they are fighting for more self-autonomy and control over their territory.
"The reason I joined the Arakan Army and train as a female soldier is because I don't want to see the Myanmar army oppress and kill Rakhine people anymore," says female recruit Soe Soe, as she slings an AK-74 over her shoulder.
"The Myanmar army bullies and treats us badly in every way they can. I can't take it so I made a decision to serve my nationality and army."
Like the other armed groups in their Northern Alliance, comprised of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) the Ta-ang Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Arakan Army is in the midst of some heavy fighting as ongoing ceasefire negotiations with the Aung San Suu Kyi - led government and Myanmar military stumble forward.
International investment and regional development has driven up land values and increased pressure on warring groups to bring peace and stability to territory that contains revenue-earning resources or serves as corridors to deliver the goods.
The Arakan Army's Deputy commander, Dr. Nyo Tun Aung, who also overseas the medic training at the Laiza - based camp, says that the Rohingya Muslims aren't the only group under attack in Rakhine State.
"When there were problems with Bengali in Rakhine State the world paid attention and had sympathy for them," Nyo Tun Aung explains. "We want to beg the world please look at what's happened to the Arakan people and feel for us too. We're also in the same situation like the Bengali."
Rohingya
The Rohingya Muslim population in Rakhine State is often referred to as Bengali by the Burmese population, a derogatory term insinuating that they come from neighboring Bangladesh.
More than 750,000 Rohingya were driven out of Rakhine State during an army clearance operation by Myanmar forces in 2017.
Now, more than 900,000 remain in Bangladesh refugee camps and top Myanmar officials are under investigation by international rights groups for crimes against humanity.
Despite the majority of the Rakhine state's civilian population being predominately Buddhist ethnic Rakhine, the locals have still been a target of the central Burmese army.
Key economic zones under development in Rakhine State - and funded by China and India - have already led to massive displacement of both the Buddhist and Muslim populations.
The US $484 million Kaladan project plans to connect Sittwe port with the eastern Indian seaport of Kolkata while China is backing a deep sea port in Kyaukphyu, estimated at US $1.3 billion.
A $1.5 billion oil pipeline will also run from the Bay of Bengal to China.
While the pipelines and deep sea ports will provide oil and gas to neighboring countries, the local population has yet to see the benefits.
"One day I stand on top of the mountain. I look down to the capital and I see their lights all over the city but when I look back to our village I hope to see the lights but what I see is only the darkness," says AA Second Lieutenant Kyaw Than, on the sidelines of the training camp.
In addition to the lack of electricity in parts of the state, the civilian population is also facing blockage of internet services.
In June 2019, Myanmar's government shut down the internet in nine townships - eight in Rakhine State and one in Chin State - impeding humanitarian aid, business, media access, and human rights monitoring, according to a Fortify Rights report, a human rights group with a focus on Asia.
In justifying the shutdown, Telenor Group said the Ministry of Transport and Communications cited "disturbances of peace and use of internet services to coordinate illegal activities, cited the report.
"A blackout on internet access for civilians creates an enabling environment for human rights violations," said Fortify Rights' Matthew Smith.
"Instead of limiting communication, the Myanmar and Bangladesh authorities should be facilitating access for humanitarian aid workers, journalists, and human rights monitors to civilians in need," Smith added.
Meanwhile, counter-terrorism charges filed by the Myanmar Police Force against four Arakan Army leaders for attacks on police posts in Rakhine state earlier this year, remain outstanding - as ceasefire talks continue with the ethnic groups.
The charges against members of the AA, are the first in which any ethnic leaders have been charged under the country's Counter-Terrorism Law
If convicted, the AA leaders face three to seven years in jail with or without a fine under the law's Section 52(a), according to Myanmar press.
Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's Union Minister for the Office of the State Counsellor, said that Rohingya repatriation is still on the table, even as the ongoing conflicts continue.
"Our priority now is to expedite repatriation and to create a more conducive environment for verified returnees," he stated, during a September 28 UN General Assembly meeting.
Meanwhile Cease-fire talks continue between government forces and the various ethnic armed groups with hopes of finding common ground.
"Our main goal to fight is we want the equality and self determination," reiterates AA Deputy commander Nyo Tun Aung.
"This is outstanding point and policy from our organization. We want to be able to have our own Arakan State future."
