Title: Myanmar: Populations at Risk - Current Crisis (15 December 2016) - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Stateless Rohingya in Burma/Myanmar face systematic persecution that poses an existential threat to their community. Recent violence and ongoing human rights violations against the Rohingya amount to possible crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.
BACKGROUND:The situation in Arakan/Rakhine state in northwest Burma/Myanmar continues to deteriorate following a series of attacks on border guard posts on 9 October by what appears to be a newly-established armed group, and a subsequent joint army-police counterinsurgency operation that began on 10 October. Since then, there have been widespread reports of mass arrests, rape, forcible removal from homes, extrajudicial killings of Rohingya and the widespread destruction of Rohingya buildings and mosques. The army deployed helicopter gunships to several Rohingya villages on 12 and 13 November, resulting in the death of at least 25 civilians. On 24 November the UN Refugee Agency's (UNHCR) representative in Bangladesh accused the Burma/Myanmar government of seeking the "ethnic cleansing" of the Rohingya from its territory.
Humanitarian assistance for more than 130,000 people in the northern part of Arakan/Rakhine state remains suspended. Following a 2 to 4 December visit to Arakan/Rakhine state, Kofi Annan, in his capacity as the Chairperson of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, called for humanitarian and media access to the affected area.
On 1 December the government established a "national level committee" to investigate the 9 October border post attacks and allegations of abuses by the security forces in northern Arakan/Rakhine state. Vice President Myint Swe, a retired army general, was appointed to lead the committee, which does not include any Rohingya commissioners.
The Rohingya, a distinct Muslim ethnic minority group, have been systematically disenfranchised and marginalized under discriminatory laws in Burma/Myanmar. In March 2015 the former government invalidated the identification cards held by many Rohingyas, forcing them to apply for citizenship as "Bengalis," implying their illegal migration from Bangladesh. This follows the government denying Rohingyas the ability to self-identify on the national census of March 2014, the first since 1983. Former President Thein Sein signed into law the last of four so-called "Protection of Race and Religion" bills in August 2015. These discriminatory laws place harsh restrictions on women and non-Buddhists, including on fundamental religious freedoms, as well as reproductive and marital rights. Rohingyas were largely disenfranchised in advance of Burma/Myanmar's historic November 2015 elections and continue to be denied citizenship and other fundamental human rights. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, the "widespread and systematic" abuses of the Rohingya community amount to crimes against humanity.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of November 2016 an estimated 120,000 people, mostly Rohingyas, continue to live in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Arakan/Rakhine state, many of them since 2012 inter-communal violence. Many Rohingyas in Arakan/Rakhine state also face the ongoing threat of recurring violence at the hands of Buddhist extremists who reject their right to exist in Burma/Myanmar.
The cumulative impact of deteriorating living conditions, combined with ongoing persecution, has led tens of thousands of Rohingyas to flee to neighboring countries, where they are often subject to further abuse, human trafficking and refoulement. After the recent escalation of violence, as many as 20,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi authorities have been criticized for forcing many asylum-seekers to involuntarily return to Burma/Myanmar.
The country's military forces (Tatmadaw) also pose an ongoing threat to other ethnic groups in Burma/Myanmar. While the previous government signed ceasefire agreements with several ethnic armed groups, conflict continues. The NLD government held a peace conference – the 21st Century Panglong – with ethnic armed groups from 31 August to 3 September. However, shortly after the conference fighting resumed in several states, including in northern Shan, Kachin and Karen.
ANALYSIS:The recent violence in Arakan/Rakhine state represents a dangerous escalation of the conflict between state security forces and the Rohingya minority, heightening the risk of further mass atrocity crimes. The obstruction of humanitarian aid further endangers the lives of vulnerable populations.
While independent investigation into the situation in northern Arakan/Rakhine state is urgently needed, international observers have questioned the impartiality of the newly-established national investigatory committee.
The previous government's refusal to end discriminatory state policies against Rohingyas encouraged violations of their fundamental human rights and reinforced the dangerous perception of the Rohingya as ethnic outsiders. The Protection of Race and Religion bills were intended to eradicate the Rohingya's legal right to exist as a distinct ethnic group in Burma/Myanmar.
The NLD government, uniquely positioned to improve the plight of the Rohingya and hailed by many international partners for making progress towards democracy, has yet to repeal existing discriminatory laws and anti-Rohingya policies.
With a pervasive culture of impunity, the military has not been held accountable for previous mass atrocity crimes, and there are grave fears for the safety of vulnerable Rohingya civilians as the security forces continue operations in Arakan/Rakhine state.
The government of Burma/Myanmar is failing to uphold its primary Responsibility to Protect with regard to the Rohingya.
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE:Following decades of military dictatorship, democratic reforms have contributed to rapprochement between Burma/Myanmar and the international community, including the lifting of sanctions by a number of countries.
Citing progress on human rights under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, the European Union (EU) announced on 16 September that it would not be submitting a UN General Assembly human rights resolution on Burma/Myanmar for the first time since 1991, effectively terminating the position of the UN Special Adviser on Myanmar.
At the request of the United States, on 17 November the UN Security Council (UNSC) was briefed on the situation in northern Arakan/Rakhine state by the Special Adviser of the UN Secretary-General on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar. Following the briefing, the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, Samantha Power, called for international observers to be allowed to enter the affected area and for humanitarian assistance to be restored.
On 29 November the UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, released a statement calling on the government to allow investigation of allegations of "serious human rights violations against the civilian population, particularly the Rohingya Muslim population." Special Adviser Dieng also urged the government of Bangladesh not to close its borders to refugees.
On 4 December Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak led a protest rally in Kuala Lumpur against what he called a "genocide" of the Rohingya minority and urged other Asian countries to apply pressure on the government of Burma/Myanmar.
On 8 December Special Adviser Nambiar issued a statement calling upon Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Arakan/Rakhine state and to reassure civilians they would be protected. The Special Adviser also urged Aung San Suu Kyi to address "the root causes affecting the local population," particularly the question of citizenship.
On 9 December Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and United States issued a statement calling for a full and immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance in Arakan/Rakhine state.
Aung San Suu Kyi called for a special informal meeting with foreign ministers of Association of Southeast Asian Nations on 19 December in Yangon to discuss international concerns over the situation in Arakan/Rakhine state.
NECESSARY ACTION:While responding to the recent border post attacks, the NLD government and Tatmadaw, which the government does not directly control, must work together to prioritize protection of civilians and ensure that all security operations in Arakan/Rakhine state are fully compliant with international law. Authorities must urgently ensure that humanitarian aid can reach vulnerable populations in Arakan/Rakhine state, especially the Rohingya.
The government of Burma/Myanmar must uphold its Responsibility to Protect all populations, regardless of their ethnicity or religion. The NLD government should immediately abolish the Rakhine Action Plan and end institutionalized discrimination against the Rohingya, including the denial of citizenship. The government must prohibit hate speech and hold accountable all those who commit human rights abuses. The government should collaborate with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to open a UN human rights office in Burma/Myanmar.
In Arakan/Rakhine state the government must facilitate the safe, voluntary return of IDPs to their communities. Countries that receive Rohingya asylum seekers should offer them protection and assistance.
The UN should establish an independent, international Commission of Inquiry to investigate the situation in northern Arakan/Rakhine state.

Title: Rohingya Muslims
TheRohingya people(/ˈroʊɪndʒə/,/ˈroʊhɪndʒə/,/ˈroʊɪŋjə/, or/ˈroʊhɪŋjə/), areIndo-Aryan peoplesfrom theRakhine State,Myanmar, who speak theRohingya language. According to Rohingyas and some scholars, they are indigenous to Rakhine State, while other historians claim that they migrated to Myanmar fromBengalprimarily during the period ofBritish rule in Burma, and to a lesser extent, after the Burmese independence in 1948 andBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971.
Muslims have settled in Rakhine State (also known as Arakan) since the 16th century, although the number of Muslim settlers before the British rule is unclear. After thefirst Anglo-Burmese Warin 1826, British annexed Arakan and encouraged migrations from Bengal to work as farm laborers. The Muslim population may have constituted 5% of Arakan's population by 1869, although estimates for earlier years give higher numbers. Successive British censuses of 1872 and 1911 recorded an increase in Muslim population from 58,255 to 178,647 in Akyab District. During World War II, theArakan massacres in 1942involvedcommunal violencebetween British-armedV ForceRohingya recruits and BuddhistRakhine peopleand the region became increasingly ethnically polarized.

Title: The Ongoing Genocide in Myanmar
At this moment, a genocide is happening in Myanmar of which most of the world is unaware.  On 9 October 2016, three border posts were attacked in Western Myanmar by an unknown armed group, killing nine policemen. Following the attack, Myanmar government forces have been conducting a coordinated attack on the civilian population which includes mass killing, rape, torture and the burning of houses and crop fields. Because security forces have locked down the whole area, it is difficult to verify the reports of violence. Utilising independent sources,Voice of Americahas reported that the death toll could be 150 to 300 so far. Based on satellite imagery,Human Rights Watch(HRW) has observed that 1,250 houses or buildings have been destroyed as of 18 November.
As a result of the military crackdown, thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes; many are attempting to enter neighbouring Bangladesh by crossing the Naaf river. However, the Bangladeshi government has refused to accept more Rohingya, stating that the highly-populated country is already hosting half a million Rohingya who have fled the previous violence.
The attacks on the Rohingya people in Myanmar are not a new phenomenon. The Rohingya have had an uneasy relationship with the state since Myanmar’s independence in 1948. The Rohingya are an ethno-linguistic-religious minority group in Myanmar. They are followers of Sunni Islam in the Buddhist-majority state. The northern Rakhine State (formerly Arakan) where most Rohingya people live is in the middle of South East Asia and South Asia. The Myanmar government argues that the Rohingya people have migrated from neighbouring Bangladesh and so denies them citizenship rights. However, the Rohingya people can trace their origin in the Rakhine State back for hundreds of years. Rakhine State was once an independent Arakan kingdom comprising north-western Myanmar and south-eastern Bangladesh before being taken over by Burma in 1784.

Title: Burmese ‘stopped from seeking shelter’ in China: NGO | News | Al Jazeera
Fighting between the Burmese military and an ethnic armed group has displaced 23,000 people in Kachin State.
Around 4,000 Burmese civilians have been stopped from seeking shelter in neighbouring China by Chinese soldiers after they attempted to flee local fighting, a non-governmental organisation said.
The incident occurred in the country’s northern Kachin State on Wednesday, where fighting between the Burmese military and an ethnic armed group has displaced 23,000 people since the outbreak of the conflict several weeks ago, campaign group Fortify Rights said.




“China should provide asylum seekers with sanctuary, not send them into the line of fire,” said Matthew Smith, chief executive officer of Fortify Rights.
The organisation also said that Myanmar authorities were restricting humanitarian aid groups from operating in the affected region.
The restrictions were resulting in “avoidable deprivations of food, healthcare, and other humanitarian provisions for displaced communities,” Fortify Rights said.
Kachin State has been beset by a conflict since 2011 when government troops broke a 17-year-old ceasefire agreement with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). More than 100,000 civilians have been displaced since.
Elsewhere in Myanmar, fighting between the military and an ethnic rebel group, Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), has intensified and the two sides traded blame on Friday over heavy shelling that killed two civilians in an area near the country’s northeastern border with China.
IN PICTURES: Displaced in Shan state
The office of the commander-in-chief of the armed forces said TNLA fired heavy weapons at a military outpost in Namhsan Township of Shan State on Thursday, but four stray shells landed in Ho Chaung village around three kilometres away from the outpost.
“Two residents were killed and eight villagers, including three women, injured because of the strayed weapon shells,” the statement said.
The dead included a seven-year-old boy who the statement said was injured while playing outside his house and died on the way to hospital.
The rebel group, however, said the shells were fired by the Myanmar army as the ethnic people of the region gathered to celebrate Ta’ang Revolution Day on January 12.
TNLA spokesperson Ta Aik Kyaw told Anadolu Agency that the group attacked the army bases in retaliation for recent assaults on their outposts in the area.
The TNLA and other groups jointly attacked police stations, military outposts and a trade zone in Shan’s Muse Township in November.
Several rebel groups had refused to sign the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), a peace deal between Myanmar’s previous quasi-civilian government and eight rebels groups in October 2015.

State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of the country’s first civilian government in more than 50 years, has been calling on rebel groups to join an ongoing peace process by signing the NCA as her administration prepares to hold a second meeting with armed ethnic groups later this month.
On Friday, New York-based Human Right Watch (HRW) said the government has failed to hold the military accountable for persistent human rights violations throughout the country.
In its World Report, HRW said Myanmar’s new civilian government has done little to address the military’s brutal crackdown on ethnic Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine State and other abuses against civilians, or to reform laws limiting freedom of expression and assembly rights.

Title: Myanmar: Two civilians killed by artillery strike in Namhsan - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG
RANGOON — Two people were killed and eight were wounded when an artillery shell landed on a civilian house in Namhsan Township, Shan State on Thursday morning, according to local sources.
One of the dead was an eight-year-old student who lived in the house, and the other was a dance instructor who had traveled from Mandalay to teach. The two deceased victims were killed instantly, according to Namhsan Township lawmaker Mai Win Htoo.
“They were giving dancing lessons at the house” when the shell landed, Mai Win Htoo told The Irrawaddy. “A group of cultural dancers from Mandalay organized it.”
The wounded were taken to Lashio Hospital. The body of the dance instructor was returned to Mandalay on Thursday, the lawmaker said.
Local sources blamed the artillery shelling on the Burma Army. But the Ministry of Defense denied responsibility for the deaths, saying the shell was fired by soldiers from the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
“This was a Burma Army artillery shell, type 82-millimeter,” said Col. Tar Phone Kyaw of the TNLA. “We don’t even have 82-millimeter [shells].”
No other military clashes took place on Thursday near Namhsan town, according to both Mai Win Htoo and U Ba Taung, a leader of the Ta’ang Literature and Culture Organization who is based in the town. But a nearby Burma Army base often fired shells close to Namhsan, the two sources said.
“They [the Burma Army] fired the shell. There was no other fighting yesterday,” said U Ba Taung.
The explosion happened around 10:00 a.m.
“If we examine the shell nuts, then we can prove exactly who this artillery shell belonged to,” said Mai Win Htoo.
The TNLA celebrated their annual revolution day on Thursday. During the celebration, some TNLA soldiers were positioned outside of Namhsan town in order to block Burma Army soldiers from departing the town and disrupting the events.
The Burma Army intended to strike these same TNLA soldiers with artillery, the TNLA alleged. Then one shell went astray and killed civilians.
The defense ministry reported that TNLA soldiers fired at the Burma Army outside of Namhsan, causing the civilian deaths.
“Bombs and artillery fell four times in total on this village,” the ministry’s report said. “Two innocents were killed, and five men and three women were wounded.”

One killed in small armed clashes in Myanmar northern state - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Small armed clashes have occurred between the government troops and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), leaving one dead in the border town of Muse, Myanmar's northern Shan state, Myanmar News Agency reported Monday.
The KIA attacked the government troops from about six kilometers east of Mawtaung village in the township Sunday when the latter were conducting area clearance operation.
The government troops returned fire to the armed group which withdrew to south-west direction.
The government troops claimed one KIA body with the seizure of some guns, cartridges, bullets, mortar rounds and grenades.
In late last December, Myanmar government troops seized an outpost, Point-768, of the KIA and surrounding minor camps.
The outpost, called by KIA as Lai Hpawng, lies on communication route to KIA headquarters -- Liza.
Earlier of the month, Myanmar government troops had also occupied Gidon Outpost, a KIA stronghold in Waingmaw, in its attack with artillery power.
Military conflicts erupted in border area of northern Myanmar's Shan state on Nov. 20 last year after an alliance of three armed groups launched attacks on government's military outposts and police stations in Muse and Kutkai towns as well as a border trade zone.
Sporadic clashes between the government troops and the three armed groups -- Kachin Independence Army (KIA) , Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) , Kokang's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), continued up to date.

Title: Rights Groups Call on Myanmar For Details About 'Disappeared' Kachin Christians - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Human rights groups called on Myanmar authorities on Tuesday to provide information about two Kachin Christian leaders they fear have been forcibly “disappeared” in northern Shan state for taking reporters to a Catholic church allegedly damaged by airstrikes in clashes between the government army and ethnic guerillas.
New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), Southeast Asia-based Fortify Rights, and London-based Amnesty International want authorities to disclose the whereabouts and conditions of Langjaw Gam Seng, 35, and his cousin Dum Daw Nawng Lat, 65, both of whom have been missing since Dec. 24, 2016, when they were heading to a military base.
HRW and Fortify Rights also called on authorities to allow Yanghee Lee, the United Nations human rights envoy for Myanmar, and other rights monitors to visit conflict zones in Shan state. Lee, who is currently on a 12-day visit to Myanmar, has been denied access to violence-affected areas in Shan state.
Langjaw Gam Seng is a youth leader with the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC) in the town of Mong Ko in northern Shan state, and Dumdaw Nawng Lat, is an assistant pastor with the KBC, according to statements issued on Tuesday by HRW and Fortify Rights.
The Baptist-denominated evangelical organization headquartered in Myitkyina, Kachin state, has been helping internally displaced people who have fled fighting between the government army and ethnic militias in both Kachin and Shan states.
Someone claiming to be a member of Myanmar’s armed forces called Langjaw Gam Seng on the evening of Dec. 24 and requested that he and Dumdaw Nawng Lat go to the Byuha Gon military base in the town of Mong Ko in Muse township near the border with China to help with the release of detained civilians, according to the press releases.
Local residents reported last seeing the two men, who were helping reporters document the destruction of civilian structures in Mong Ko during hostilities between a coalition of four ethnic armies and government forces last in November and December, traveling by motorbike to the base where Myanmar army battalion numbers 99 and 55 are located, the statements said.
“The apparent enforced disappearance of these two Christian leaders has created a climate of fear and terror in northern Shan state,” said Matthew Smith, chief executive of Fortify Rights.
HRW and Fortify Rights noted that civil society organizations in Kachin and Shan states “have documented unlawful killings, torture, rape, forced labor, and other abuses committed by Burmese military forces against civilians” in the two states.
Amnesty International weighs in
In a separate statement, Amnesty International urged people to write to Myanmar authorities to order an immediate investigation into the men’s disappearances, to release them if they are in custody, and to stop violating international human rights law against ethnic civilians in conflict and cease-fire areas.
“The nature of the two men’s disappearance means the military has some serious questions to answer,” said Phil Robertson, HRW’s deputy Asia director. “This is a crucial case for [Myanmar’s de factor leader] Aung San Suu Kyi and other government leaders to demand cooperation from the army, which has continued to resist civilian authority.”
The two men’s family members and KBC representatives filed a missing persons report at Myo Ma police station in Muse township on Jan. 3.
Seven days later, Zaw Htay, spokesman of the President’s Office, said that a ground report from the government army indicated the pair had been arrested by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), which is engaged in hostilities with Myanmar soldiers in northern Shan state.
Armed conflicts in Kachin and Shan states intensified last November when the Northern Alliance of four ethnic militias—the KIA, Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)—launched coordinated attacks on government and military targets in northern Shan state.
The government has reported that 10 civilians have died in ground and air strikes, while thousands of others have fled over the border into southwestern China.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that the fighting in Kachin and Shan states has displaced more than 100,000 people.
More civilians flee
Meanwhile, more than 100 people have fled the town of Namhsan in Tawngpeng district, northern Shan state, on Tuesday to the central city of Mandalay to escape ongoing fighting between TNLA troops and the government army, a Mandalay official said.
Win Naing Zaw said 113 people from 32 households have sought refuge in the Myinwun Mingyi monastery in Myanmar’s second-largest city.
“As far as I know, 93 people arrived first, and then 20 people from five households arrived yesterday,” Win Naing Zaw, Mandalay district administrator, told RFA’s Myanmar Service.
“CSOs and the regional military headquarters helped them yesterday by providing rice, cooking oil, clothing, mosquito nets, blankets, and other goods they need,” he said.
Altogether, more than 2,000 people have fled to Mandalay and the towns of Lashio, Kyaukme, Thibaw, Naungcho, and Pyin Oo Lwin to escape the clashes that have killed two people and injured 10 others, he said.** Reported by Thiri Min Zin for RFA’s Myanmar Service.

Yangon, Myanmar, January 25, 2017 —The undersigned humanitarian and development NGOs operating in Kachin and Northern Shan States in Myanmar are gravely concerned about the continually escalating armed conflict and the severely deteriorating security situation for the civilian population in Kachin and Northern Shan States.
We are alarmed about incidents of civilians being killed, injured and displaced due to intensification of military operations and use of heavy artillery in close proximity to IDP camps and populated areas. Of particular concern are the dire living conditions and the lack of access to humanitarian aid of over 6,000 displaced people from camps in Maga Yang, Zai Awng and Hkau Shau in Kachin State.
We also express our concern about the situation of the civilian population in Mansi Township, Kachin State and the evolving situation in Kutkai, Kyaukme and Nam San Townships in Northern Shan State, as the conflict intensifies, especially the additional 5,600 people that have recently been displaced due to ongoing conflict in Northern Shan State.
In the absence of a political solution to the humanitarian crisis and any imminent prospect of an inclusive peace dialogue in Kachin and Northern Shan States, the situation of those displaced communities is particularly alarming given the lack of safe locations, threats to their safety, increasing restrictions on their freedom of movement and their inability to access humanitarian aid.
We, as local, national and international organisations committed to the principles of humanity, independence, neutrality, and impartiality, urge the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and all parties to the conflict to promote, respect and facilitate the protection of civilians and access of humanitarian assistance to all those in need. We strongly encourage the international community to continue to advocate for the protection of civilians and unobstructed humanitarian access to affected populations in these areas in addition to increasing funding to meet the rapidly expanding needs of displaced people.
The undersigned NGOs request the following:
1)  The immediate cessation of armed conflict in Kachin and Northern Shan States.
2)  To ensure the protection and safety of the civilian population and displaced persons in areas affected by armed conflict.
3)  To fulfil the obligations under customary International Humanitarian Law to protect civilians, civilian locations and civilian assets, and bring an immediate end to all violations of human rights by all parties to the conflict.
4)  To ensure that basic humanitarian needs and rights of the affected civilian populations are met.
5)  To remove all impediments and restrictions, formal or informal, to the movement of humanitarian aid including personnel, goods and services to ensure timely response to humanitarian needs.
6)  To constructively engage in a mediated peace dialogue to achieve sustainable peace in Myanmar.

One killed in small armed clashes in Myanmar northern state - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Small armed clashes have occurred between the government troops and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), leaving one dead in the border town of Muse, Myanmar's northern Shan state, Myanmar News Agency reported Monday.
The KIA attacked the government troops from about six kilometers east of Mawtaung village in the township Sunday when the latter were conducting area clearance operation.
The government troops returned fire to the armed group which withdrew to south-west direction.
The government troops claimed one KIA body with the seizure of some guns, cartridges, bullets, mortar rounds and grenades.
In late last December, Myanmar government troops seized an outpost, Point-768, of the KIA and surrounding minor camps.
The outpost, called by KIA as Lai Hpawng, lies on communication route to KIA headquarters -- Liza.
Earlier of the month, Myanmar government troops had also occupied Gidon Outpost, a KIA stronghold in Waingmaw, in its attack with artillery power.
Military conflicts erupted in border area of northern Myanmar's Shan state on Nov. 20 last year after an alliance of three armed groups launched attacks on government's military outposts and police stations in Muse and Kutkai towns as well as a border trade zone.
Sporadic clashes between the government troops and the three armed groups -- Kachin Independence Army (KIA) , Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) , Kokang's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), continued up to date.

Seven Kachin Independence Army troops (KIA) were killed as the Myanmar Army took over four more outposts from the powerful ethnic Kachin armed group in an area near Myanmar’s border with China, the Anadolu Agency reported on 9 January quoting the Office of the Commander-In-Chief.
Myanmar’s military has recently seized eight outposts, including the Gideon Outpost, a strategic hill near the border town of Laiza where the KIA’s headquarters is situated, during a military offensive involving air support and artillery power.
The KIA one of the most powerful armed ethnic groups in Myanmar, has not signed any peace deals with the government since 2011 when fighting with the military resumed in northern Kachin State.
