Title: Mizoram govt provides shelter to 1,300 Myanmar tribals fleeing clashes in Arakan state – Firstpost
The people who crossed over to Mizoram were mostly Buddhists and Christians and they speak the same tribal language as the locals
Aizawl:The Mizoram government has given shelter and relief to around 1,300 tribals from neighbouring Myanmar’s restive Arakan state who have taken refuge in southern Mizoram, officials said on Monday.
“Around 1,300 men, women and children have fled from Arakan state and taken refuge in four villages of Lawngtlai district (in southern Mizoram) on Saturday night,” Lawngtlai district police chief Lalsanglura toldIANS.
“The Myanmarese fled their homes after the Army clashed with the outlawed ‘Arakan Army’ militant outfit cadres last week. As the armed clashes continue, we would not push back the refugees due to humanitarian grounds.”
According to the police official, the district administration now constructing makeshift relief camps for the refugees, adding that since the clashes are on, more refugees might cross over to Mizoram.
Assam Rifles and state police were deployed in the area.
Lalsanglura said he, Lawngtlai Deputy Commissioner Arun T, and senior Assam Rifles officials would visit the areas on the Myanmar border on Tuesday to supervise the relief and other necessary arrangements for the refugees.
The people who crossed over to Mizoram were mostly Buddhists and Christians and they speak the same tribal language as the locals.
This is the fourth instance in recent past of Myanmarese people entering Mizoram after ethnic troubles in the neighbouring country.
The local villagers initially volunteered to provide food to the Arakanese people and arranged shelter for them.
The mountainous, northeastern state of Mizoram has a 510-km border with Myanmar and 318 km with Bangladesh, guarded by Assam Rifles and the Border Security Force, respectively.
Meanwhile, during the past twelve weeks, over 6,22,000 non-tribal Rohingya refugees fled to southeastern Bangladesh to escape a military crackdown in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.
The current Rohingya exodus to Bangladesh started with the Myanmar security forces responding to the 25 August attacks on government outposts by the Rohingya rebel group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.

Title: Government peace envoy to Wa, Mongla proves fruitless at selling NCA | Burma News International
Burma News International (BNI) is a network of 15 independent media and news organizations based in and around Burma
Government peace negotiators attempting to bring Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed group, the United Wa State Army, in line with the current peace process found their efforts strongly rebuffed this weekend.
A government delegation visited the UWSA at its headquarters in Pangkham (Pangsang) on November 11. According to representatives from the armed group, the negotiators urged a quick signing of the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA) so that political discussions can get under way.
But the UWSA, with its own semi-autonomous fiefdom along the border with China, stands to gain little from renegotiating the lines of its power or territorial influence under the agreement. Instead, the group heads an oppositional bloc of ethnic armed groups currently engaged in fighting the Tatmadaw in northern Shan and Kachin states. The emergence of the UWSA-led Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) has been one of the biggest shifts of power in the ongoing peace process. The FPNCC members have turned away from the Tatmadaw-favored NCA process, and instead, say they want to redraft negotiations around a more balanced process that will grant greater autonomy to ethnic groups who have long felt resentment toward the Burmese-dominated central government.
For the UWSA and its political wing, the United Wa State Party, signing the NCA does not appear to be on the table.“[They want us to] sign the NCA, but we have already released a statement concerning this issue. We responded that we will continue to follow the FPNCC’s principle [of forging a new path],” said Nyi Rang, the deputy officer from the UWSP/UWSA liaison office in Lashio.The Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA), another leading member of the FPNCC, says it also will not capitulate to Nay Pyi Taw’s attempts to pressure groups into signing the pact amid growing frustrations with a lack of progress on the peace front.“There aren’t any other paths for us,” said KIA information officer Lieutenant Colonel Naw Bu.China’s Asia-Pacific regional representative recently urged the FPNCC to sign the NCA during a meeting. But the appeal fell on deaf ears, creating a significant stumbling bloc for the government.“All seven members stand by the FPNCC’s decision,” said Brigadier General Tar Bone Kyaw, general secretary of the Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA).Following its overtures to the Wa and the Mongla group, the government announced only that its delegation, led by the Union Minister of Border Affairs, visited the territory to discuss regional stability, development and peace. No further details were released.Last year, the Shan State Hluttaw designated the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA) as terrorist organizations. UWSA representatives said the labelling, which it described as unnecessarily complicating the issue, was discussed at the November 11 meeting with the government envoy.“We are happy to hear that our ally made [the request for dropping the designation]. We are not a terrorist organization even though we have been branded as one by the huttaw,” said Brig-Gen Tar Bone Kyaw.The UWSA also reiterated that it is only interested in entering into peace talks with the government if all groups from the seven-member bloc can participate.The FPNCC is composed of the UWSA, the KIA, the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army (SSPP/SSA), the MNDAA, the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), the TNLA and the AA.

“I feel happy to see the Shan elder and the Wa representative together. Whatever prompted this, it is a ray of light for Shan State this New Year celebration. The Wa [UWSA] are also a vital armed group in the Shan State,” said a monk who attended the event.But the UWSA, one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed groups with its own virtual fiefdom along the border with China, has attained growing clout as the head of a new bloc of northern armed organizations. The UWSA is a leading member of the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC), which has refused to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA), while the RCSS/SSA is one of the eight ethnic armed organizations to have signed the NCA.Despite the disparity of their current positions with regards to the peace process, the two groups have already met for talks several times this year, at the Thai border in mid-August and in Pangsang, the UWSA’s headquarters later the same month.At the Shan New Year event, the RCSS/SSA and the UWSA delegation informally discussed Shan State affairs, Union affairs, peace and spats between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the RCSS.The UWSA and the RCSS clashed once in 2000-2001 and once in 2004-2005 near the RCSS/SSA bases along the Thai-Shan border.

Some observers took the delegation as a good sign, portending greater cooperation among Shan State groups.
“I feel happy to see the Shan elder and the Wa representative together. Whatever prompted this, it is a ray of light for Shan State this New Year celebration. The Wa [UWSA] are also a vital armed group in the Shan State,” said a monk who attended the event.But the UWSA, one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed groups with its own virtual fiefdom along the border with China, has attained growing clout as the head of a new bloc of northern armed organizations. The UWSA is a leading member of the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC), which has refused to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement (NCA), while the RCSS/SSA is one of the eight ethnic armed organizations to have signed the NCA.Despite the disparity of their current positions with regards to the peace process, the two groups have already met for talks several times this year, at the Thai border in mid-August and in Pangsang, the UWSA’s headquarters later the same month.At the Shan New Year event, the RCSS/SSA and the UWSA delegation informally discussed Shan State affairs, Union affairs, peace and spats between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the RCSS.The UWSA and the RCSS clashed once in 2000-2001 and once in 2004-2005 near the RCSS/SSA bases along the Thai-Shan border.

Myanmar: Drop Criminal Defamation Charges Against
Kachin ActivistDecriminalize
defamation laws, uphold right to freedom of
expression(YANGON, November 14, 2017)—The
Government of Myanmar should immediately and unconditionally
drop criminal defamation charges against 56-year-old ethnic
Kachin human rights defender Dashi Naw Lawn and uphold the
right to freedom of expression, said the Kachin Women’s
Association of Thailand (KWAT) and Fortify Rights today. The
Mohnyin District Court will determine whether to uphold the
charges against Dashi Naw Lawn today.“The authorities
want to keep what is happening in Kachin State quiet,”
said Moon Nay Li, General Secretary of the KWAT. “But we
are not afraid to speak the truth—the Myanmar military are
killing, raping and torturing innocent people, and they must
be held accountable for it.”On June 13, Major Kyi Min
Htun of Myanmar Army Light Infantry Division 101 filed a
criminal defamation complaint against Dashi Naw Lawn in the
Hpakant Township Court, Kachin State. Under Section 500 of
the Myanmar Penal Code, Dashi Naw Lawn faces up to two years
in prison and/or a fine if convicted.The complaint
relates to the distribution of pamphlets in Hpakant Township
on June 9 by approximately 25 youths from the Kachin
National Development Foundation—otherwise known asMyusha Zinlumin the Kachin language of
Jingpaw—alleging that the Myanmar military raped and
killed Kachin women and destroyed villages and religious
sites during the conflict in Kachin State. Dashi Naw Lawn is
the General Secretary of the Kachin National Development
Foundation.Judge Soe Lin Aung from the Hpakant Township
Court accepted the charges against Dashi Naw Lawn on June
13. On October 2, Dashi Naw Lawn appealed to the Mohnyin
District Court to drop the charges against
him.“Reminding the authorities that they must respect
human rights is not a crime," said Matthew Smith, Chief
Executive Officer of Fortify Rights. “Myanmar authorities
should drop the charges against Dashi Naw Lawn.”Fortify
Rights documented the systematic use of torture
by the Myanmar authorities against Kachin civilians and
published evidence that the Myanmar Army had targeted,
attacked, and killed civilians with impunity during
fighting in Kachin and northern Shan states since 2011. The
conflict between the Myanmar military and the Kachin
Independence Army (KIA) has displaced more than 100,000
civilians, many of whom reside in camps for the displaced.
Myanmar authorities are responsible for avoidable
deprivations of adequate food, healthcare, water and
sanitation, and shelter for those who are displaced in
Kachin and northern Shan states.International law
protects the right to freedom of expression and allows
restrictions only in exceptional circumstances to protect
vital state interests and if certain specific conditions are
met. This case does not satisfy the requisite
conditions.Criminal defamation laws are frequently used
by Myanmar authorities to target human rights defenders. For
example, on October 27, the Lashio District Court convicted
Dumdaw Nawng Lat, an ethnic Kachin religious leader, of
criminal defamation for an interview he gave toVoice of
Americain December 2016 in which he alleged that the
Myanmar military had attacked civilians during conflict with
ethnic armed groups. He is currently in prison in northern
Shan State, serving a sentence of four years and three
months on charges including criminal defamation.Under
international law, criminal penalties, and particularly
imprisonment, are considered disproportionate forms of
punishment for defamation.The Myanmar authorities should
urgently decriminalize defamation and drop the charges
against Dashi Naw Lawn and other human rights defenders,
said KWAT and Fortify Rights."While the military attempts
to stifle freedoms, communities in Myanmar continue to
demand their rights,” said Matthew Smith, Chief Executive
Officer of Fortify Rights. “It’s time for the government
to show that it’s capable of ending these horrors and hold
perpetrators to
account.”© Scoop MediaAdvertisement - scroll to continue readingAre you licensed for Scoop?Scoop is free for personal use, but you’ll need a licence for work use.

Title: KIA Reports Frequent Clashes with Tatmadaw Throughout November - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
ByNYEIN NYEIN
CHIANG MAI, Thailand — Fighting resumed between the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, and the Kachin Independence Army in Kachin State’s Tanai Township in early November, with frequent clashes continuing throughout the month, according to a KIA spokesman.
“Clashes resumed early in the month and continued up until Tuesday, Nov. 28,” Colonel Naw Bu of the KIA told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday. “It may represent a follow-up to the Tatmadaw’s military clearance operation [in Tanai],” he said, referring to June clashes thatforced local villagers to fleetheir homes.
The Tatmadaw attacked the KIA’s Battalion 14 area [a 10-mile radius within Tanai Township] with heavy artillery, but there had been no reports of casualties as of yesterday, Naw Bu said.
The fighting, while not daily, was frequent and usually involved barrages of more than 30 artillery rounds. “It usually starts in the morning after 6 a.m. and continues until the afternoon,” he said.
As fightingerupted again in the amber-rich areas, the return of already internally displaced villagers is still uncertain, said local relief workers.
Naw Tawng, a Catholic priest from Kawng Ra village of Tanai told The Irrawaddy on Thursday, “Some displaced villagers of N’Ga Ga and Nam Byu villages are still sheltering in churches and others are with their relatives in Tanai.”
The KIA spokesman said they were unable to help those who fled to towns such as Tanai or Myitkyina.
Naw Bu said there had been no ceasefire talks between the KIA and the government or the Tatmadaw. “We will just follow the FPNCC’s principles regarding peace talks,” he said, referring to the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee, an alliance of seven northern armed groups including the KIA.
Earlier, the KIA and Tatmadaw were involved in intense clashes in June and July following the second session of the Panglong Peace conference in May.
In May, the FPNCC demanded an alternative approach to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA).
The FPNCC is led by the United Wa State Army. Four of its members – the KIA, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Kokang’s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Arakan Army (AA) – are currently engaged in active fighting against the Tatmadaw in Kachin, northern Shan State and most recently in Rakhine and Chin State’s Paletwa Township.
