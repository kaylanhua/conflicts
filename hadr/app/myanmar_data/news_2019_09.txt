Myanmar's gov't, armed groups issue joint communique on ceasefire - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Myanmar government's National Reconciliation and Peace Center (NRPC) and four ethnic armed groups issued a joint communique late on Saturday following their meeting in Kengtung, Shan state, earlier on the day.
The four armed groups are Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), Palaung State Liberation Front (PSLF) or Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Myanmar National Truth and Justice Party (MNTJP) or Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the United League of Arakan(ULA) or Arakan Army (AA).
Matters relating to stopping the ongoing armed engagements were discussed in order to sign a bilateral ceasefire agreement and then a nationwide ceasefire agreement, the communique said, adding that matters related to deployment of forces and rules and procedures to prevent outbreak of fighting were also agreed to be discussed with the military representatives.
Both sides pledged in the communique to make efforts with full political will towards stopping the ongoing armed engagements for national reconciliation and union peace.
The meeting set the holding of the next round of meeting from Sept. 16 to Sept. 17 without confirming the venue.
Three armed groups of northern Alliance involving AA, TNLA and MNDAA launched coordinated attacks at five places in Mandalay region and Shan state on Aug. 15, killing 15 with 13 others injured.
The shelling hit some military structures in Nawnghkio and destroyed some bridges on Hsenwi-Kunlong road. The major towns of Lashio and Kutkai also came under attack.
Meanwhile, Myanmar military announced on Saturday extending the suspension period of its operations against armed groups for 21 more days until Sept. 21, aimed at enabling all stakeholders to continue engagement in the peace process.
The Myanmar military had extended the non-operation period for three times before, from Dec. 21, 2018 to April 30, 2019, from May 1 to June 30 this year and from July 1 to Aug. 31 this year, respectively.

Arakan Army uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to trigger landmines against Myanmar, this poses a threat to Kaladan Project
Manish Shukla
Updated :Sep 12, 2019, 06:00 AM IST
A fresh report by the intelligence agencies has suggested that Arakan Army, an insurgent group of Myanmar, is using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technology to trigger landmines against Myanmar Army.
The Arakan Army has set up several camps in areas across Mizoram's Lawngtala district, posing threat to the Kaladan Project, which is a multi-modal transit transport project and considered India's gateway to Southeast Asia.
The insurgent group also has a presence in Mizoram. This is the reason why Indian security agencies are verifying the use of such technology by insurgent groups to trigger landmines.
"We have requested Assam Rifles to find out about the use of 'Bluetooth' technology to trigger the landmines by insurgent groups," said official working with Indian security establishments.
The report exclusively accessed by Zee News also suggests that Myanmar Army has placed jammers to neutralise the threat of these landmines. The infantry battalions of Myanmar Army located in Northern Rakhine state is frequently using jammers while moving through these areas. The Arakan Army have been trained by another insurgent group, the Kachin Independence Army in Myanmar, to use Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).
Earlier this year, the Indian Army carried out operation between February 17 to March 2, along the Indo-Myanmar border. The Army reportedly destroyed almost 12 camps of insurgent groups.
Despite these operations, the threat still looms large on the Kaladan Project. The operation was done in the area of south Mizoram and the Army had described it as a great success. But on the ground, the situation is still the same and the Myanmar Army is expecting more help from India to secure Kalanan project. "The Arakan Army had attacked a Burmese vessel carrying 300 steel frames for the Paletwa Bridge and abducted the entire crew but they were later released. The vessel had sailed from Yangon to Paletwa. The Arakan Army is conspiring to launch more such lethal attacks," said a security officer working in the Indian security establishment.
The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project is being viewed as India's gateway to the Southeast Asia. India entered into a framework agreement with Myanmar in April 2008, to facilitate the implementation of the project. On completion, the project will help connect Mizoram with the Sittwe Port in Rakhine State of Myanmar. On the Indian side, work is on to extend the Aizawl-Saiha National Highway by 90 km to the international border at Zorinpui.

As per the latest Intelligence report Arakan Army, an insurgent group of Myanmar is using 'Bluetooth' and 'Wifi' technology to trigger landmines against the Myanmar Army.
Arakan Army has set up several camps in areas across Mizoram's Lawngtala district and posing threat to Kaladan Project.
The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project is being viewed as India's gateway to Southeast Asia. These groups also has a presence in Mizoram.
This is the reason Indian security agencies are verifying the use of such technology available to insurgent groups to trigger the landmines.
'We have requested to Assam Rifiles to find out about the use of  'Bluetooth' technology to trigger the landmines by insurgent groups,'' said official working with Indian Security establishments.
The report exclusively accessed by Zee News also suggest that Myanmar Army has placed jammers to neutralized threat of these landmines.
The infantry battalions of Myanmar Army located in Northern Rakhine state is frequently using jammers while moving through these areas.
The Arakan Army have been trained by another insurgent group ,the Kachin Independence Army in Myanmar to use Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).
The issues became a big concern for India and Myanmar.
This year the Indian Army has also carried out operation between February 17-March 2, on its own area along the Indo-Myanmar border. It is said to have destroyed almost 12 camps of insurgent groups.
But in spite of these operations threat still looms large on the Kaladan Project. The operation was done in the area of south Mizoram and the Army had described it as a great success. But on the ground, the situation is still the same and the Myanmar Army is expecting more help from India so Kalanan Project can be secured fully.
"The Arakan Army had attacked a Burmese vessel carrying 300 steel frames for the Paletwa Bridge and abducted the entire crew but they were later released.

Title: Fighting Erupts in Both Rakhine And Shan States After Myanmar Cease-fire Expires

2019-09-24 -- The Arakan Army claimed Tuesday that its soldiers seized a Myanmar military artillery battery during a battle in Rakhine state's Myebon township during which 10 government soldiers were killed, in the latest clash between the two sides since a cease-fire expired on the weekend.
Arakan Army (AA) soldiers captured the temporary heavy artillery camp belonging to Artillery Battery No. 373 under the military's Western Regional Command on Sept. 22 near Taunggyi village, according to a statement issued by the AA .
The announcement also said the AA retrieved the 10 dead bodies, military equipment, and 18 baskets of ammunition.
A photo released by the AA shows a MG42 machine gun, four MA assault rifles, six 60-milllimeter mortar shells, three rocket-propelled grenades, nine combat helmets, and a captain's uniform among the items seized.
The artillery battery capture was the result of an AA defensive attack in response to assaults from the Myanmar Army's temporary camp since Sept. 21, said AA spokesman Khine Thukha.
"They have launched offensives since Sept. 21, so we had no choice but to fire back at them," he said. "The artillery unit from that camp fired indiscriminately at us, so we had to capture that camp."
AA soldiers fought for three hours after Myanmar forces began firing heavy artillery in several directions, he said, adding that some Arakan troops had been injured, though he did not provide an exact figure.
Colonel Win Zaw Oo, commander of the Western Regional Command, confirmed the armed engagements, but said he did not have further details.
Villagers flee homes
Mya Than, a lawmaker from Myebon township who is deputy speaker of the Rakhine state parliament, said the battle prompted residents from nearby Michaungtat and Yosanon villages to flee their homes and seek shelter in neighboring communities.
"The villagers heard the gunshots from the mountains between the two villages," he said. "Those from Yosanon village fled their homes after hearing the gunfire."
Pe Than, a lower house lawmaker from the hardline Buddhist Arakan National Party (ANP) who represents the Myebon township constituency, visited the some of the villages near the area where the fighting occurred.
"The people from the villages are scared," he told RFA's Myanmar Service, adding that only half of the area's residents had left their homes.
"All the children, women, and elderly people have been sent to other villages," he said.
There was fighting, and it is likely to continue," Pe Than said. "The villagers fear that some of the troops might come to the village and cause trouble, so they fled before that happened."
Fighting in Rakhine state flared up late last year after the AA launched a push for greater autonomy in the state, and intensified in early January after the Arakan force conducted attacks on police outposts that killed 13 officers.
The renewed armed conflict has displaced tens of thousands of civilians and killed and injured dozens of others.
Fighting flares in Kutkai
In a related development, government troops and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) exchanged fire Tuesday morning in war-torn northern Shan state's Kutkai township, the first fighting since the Myanmar military's unilateral cease-fire expired two days earlier, a TNLA spokesman said Tuesday.
The clash erupted when Myanmar soldiers launched offensives toward a mountain near Konesar where the TNLA's Infantry Battalion No. 223 and Brigade No. 5 were stationed, said TNLA spokesman Major Mai Aik Kyaw.
"The military launched offensives from the Taungthonesel area at the exit of Kutkai town," he said. "The military's Infantry Battalion Nos. 45, 242, and 69 attacked toward the mountain near Konesar village where we are stationed."
Additional Myanmar Army soldiers from Kutkai town aided the ground troops by firing 105-millimeter howitzers, he said.
It remains unclear if any soldiers were killed in the clash.
"We saw the military troops transporting four or five bodies, [but] I don't know if they were corpses or injured soldiers," Mai Aik Kyaw said.
Myanmar military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun was not available for comment.
The clash violated a unilateral truce called by the Brotherhood Alliance of three ethnic armies, comprising the TNLA, AA, and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), which runs to the end of the year to give them time to engage in peace negotiations.
The three groups are members of the larger Northern Alliance, which also includes the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), though that ethnic military is not involved in hostilities with Myanmar forces.
The Myanmar Army and TNLA troops began fighting today at 5 a.m. today in the area between Kutkai's Konesar and Parju villages and have continued fighting into the evening, villagers said.
Everyone from Konesar had fled to nearby Kamantone, Nanthudae, and Mannaung villages or into nearby forests, they said.
"We are too afraid to stay at home, and some of us are now hiding in the forest," the head of Konesar village said.
"They are still fighting as we speak," he said. "We can hear the firing of artillery. It is not far from our village. All the villagers have fled their homes and are taking shelter in nearby villages like Mantone and Nantmu."
The two sides also engaged in clashes near Konesar, Parju, and Nanthudae villages in August, prompting villagers to flee to safety.
Volunteers helping the villagers escape the hostilities said many who fled from the August battles had returned to their homes a few days ago but are now concerned that the fighting will intensify in the region.
Armed conflict has raged for most of this year between the three rebel armies and government forces in northern Shan state, displacing thousands of local residents.

Title: Myanmar IDPs Lack Food and Accommodation After Shan State Attacks - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
ByCHIT MIN TUN
Yangon – Over 100 people from Kong Sa Village who were displaced by clashes in Kutkai Township in northern Shan State say they are short of food and lack proper accommodation.
They fled to Mengtung Village after the Tatmadaw (Myanmar army) clashed with the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) near their village on Sept. 24.
“They are 40 households and 141 people in total. They are staying at the monastery. And it is not suitable for them all to sleep together. They also need food,” said Mai Ai Kham, manager of the Mengtung camp for internally displaced people (IDPs).
The IDPs are short of food. They do not dare go outside the village because they fear landmines, said Sai Bu from Kutkai who is assisting IDPs in Mengtung.
"They are very short of food. They need basics like rice, oil, salt and onions. There are landmines around the village and it is not even safe to collect firewood. Provision of groceries will help them,” she told The Irrawaddy.
Over 500 people from three villages are also taking shelter at churches in the areas, she added.
The latest clash between the Tatmadaw and the TNLA took place on Sept. 25 in Kutkai, said Mai Ai Kham.
“But villagers still do not dare return to their homes, as clashes can erupt anytime,” said Sai Bu.
A joint force from the TNLA, Arakan Army and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army launched coordinated attacks on six sites, including the Defense Services Technological Academy of the Tatmadaw in Pyin Oo Lwin, Mandalay Region, on Aug. 15, prompting retaliation from government forces. Since then sporadic fighting has taken place in northern Shan State.

Title: Ethnic Armed Alliance Extends Ceasefire for Rest of Year - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By NYEIN NYEIN
An alliance of ethnic armed groups that has been fighting the Myanmar military in the northeast and west of the country has extended its unilateral ceasefire until the end of this year, it said in a statement on Friday.
The alliance comprises the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA).
The move came one day ahead of the expiration of the Myanmar military’s own truce on Sept. 21. Observers described the armed groups’ ceasefire extension as a shrewd political move.
The groups “gain a political advantage by announcing the ceasefire,” said U Maung Maung Soe, an ethnic affairs analyst. “While we can’t say for sure whether the fighting will totally stop, the military tensions in Rakhine and northern Shan states are easing,” he said.
“It is a response to the military truce,” said Dr. Min Zaw Oo, the director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security. Unlike earlier, he said, the groups now seem to “be serious about the ceasefire”, albeit with conditions.
It is not yet known whether the Myanmar military (or Tatmadaw) will extend for a fourth time its truce in five military commands covering Shan and Kachin states. The military declared the truce—which excludes conflict-torn Rakhine State in western Myanmar—on Dec. 21, 2018, and extended it in April, June and August. Sources close to the military expect Rakhine will again be left out, even if the Tatmadaw extends its truce on Saturday.
According to their Friday announcement, the alliance’s unilateral ceasefire extension is effective until Dec. 31. The alliance announced the initial Sept. 9-Oct. 8. ceasefire last week.
The groups said the extension is aimed at facilitating the negotiation of bilateral ceasefire agreements, and reducing the fighting. “Our triple Brotherhood Alliance is ready to enforce a joint ceasefire if the Myanmar Tatmadaw is willing,” the statement reads.
However, they maintained their right to defend themselves if the Tatmadaw attacked their troops or camps, or conducted military operations in their territories; launched mortar, artillery or airstrikes in situations where the two sides’ troops were not directly engaged; or targeted civilians or blocked internally displaced persons (IDPs) from accessing food.
U Khin Zaw Oo, the secretary of the Peace Commission, described the statement as “constructive” and “a result of our negotiations.”
The latest discussions between government negotiators and representatives of the Northern Alliance, which comprises the Kachin Independence Army, MNDAA, TNLA and AA, were held in Kengtung, eastern Shan State on Tuesday.
Fighting in the area has intensified since November despite peace talks between the government’s negotiators and the Northern Alliance, organized with help from China.
The MNDAA, TNLA, and AA have troops operating in northern Shan State, and the AA also operates in Rakhine State. Clashes have occurred in Rakhine State since the AA first gained a foothold there in 2015, and began to intensify in November last year.
The peace talks resumed on Aug. 31 after the Brotherhood Alliance, as the three groups refer to themselves, stagedattacks on military and civilian targets on Aug. 15, killing 15 peopleincluding military and police personnel, as well as civilians. The attacks also seriously disrupted trade routes bound for the Muse trading zone on the China-Myanmar border in Shan State.

Title: Myanmar: Civilians at risk in Northern Shan State fighting - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENT
Index: ASA 16/0975/2019
The Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups must ensure the protection of civilians and provision of aid as violence in northern Shan State escalates, Amnesty International urged today.
On 15 August 2019, three members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition ethnic armed groups operating in northern Shan State, staged a series of indiscriminate attacks on Myanmar military installations and other locations, killing or injuring soldiers, police officers, and civilians. Since then, northern Shan State has seen an intensification of fighting between the Myanmar military – also known as the Tatmadaw – and ethnic armed groups. The renewed fighting comes despite a unilateral ceasefire announced by the Myanmar military on 21 December 2018, which was recently extended until 21 September 2019. Amnesty International and others have documented ongoing violations and abuses during this time.
Amnesty International is deeply concerned about mounting reports of civilian causalities, including the killing of five people – three of them children – on 31 August 2019 by suspected mortar fire. While it is difficult to confirm which side fired the shells, the killing likely constitutes a war crime. The organization calls on all parties to the conflict to immediately end all attacks targeting civilians and indiscriminate attacks, commit to protecting civilians, allow safe passage for those fleeing the fighting, and ensure full, safe and unfettered access for humanitarian workers.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), almost 8,000 people have been internally displaced by the latest fighting. Despite this, the Myanmar authorities – both civilian and military – continue to restrict humanitarian access in northern Shan State. Meanwhile, humanitarian actors report that ambushes and attacks on vehicles by ethnic armed groups are preventing them from accessing some areas and assisting people in need.
Under international humanitarian law, all parties to the armed conflict have an obligation to allow and facilitate delivery of impartial humanitarian assistance for civilians in need. Blocking such aid is a violation of international humanitarian law Amnesty International calls on all sides to ensure free and unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations delivering aid and emergency assistance to all civilians who need it without discrimination.
Amnesty International also calls on all parties to take immediate action to secure roads so that humanitarian organizations can provide aid and emergency assistance – including life-saving medical treatment.
BACKGROUND
The Northern Alliance is a loose coalition of ethnic armed groups operating in northern Shan State – the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and the Arakan Army (AA). The groups have engaged in active conflict with the Myanmar military in recent years, seeking greater rights, autonomy, and control over natural resources. Three of the four – now calling themselves the “Brotherhood Alliance” – were involved in the 15 August attacks: the MNDAA, the TNLA, and the AA. None of the three are signatories to Myanmar’s Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, having been excluded from joining by the authorities.
The 15 August attacks came just days after the three had issued a joint statement calling on the Myanmar military to stop fighting in Rakhine and northern Shan States and threatening retaliatory action. Since the start of 2019, there has been a major escalation of fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army in Rakhine State, which is not covered by the military’s unilateral ceasefire. Amnesty International has documented serious violations – including war crimes – by the Myanmar military, as well as violations by the AA.
This is not the first time that members of the Northern Alliance have launched coordinated attacks against security targets in recent years. In November 2016, in response to intensifying military offensives in northern Myanmar, the group attacked three military and police posts in Muse township, northern Shan State. In a June 2017 report, Amnesty International documented wide-ranging violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the Myanmar military in Kachin and northern Shan States, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, indiscriminate shelling, arbitrary detentions, torture and forced labour. Many of the violations were committed in the aftermath of the November attacks. Ethnic armed groups were also responsible for violations and abuses, including summary executions, abductions, and forced recruitment. To date, none of those responsible for abuses by any of the parties to the conflicts have been held to account.

Title: Three Myanmar Rebel Groups Announce 1-Month Ceasefire in Northern Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG
The alliance of three ethnic armed groups that has been fighting the Myanmar military in northern Shan State on Monday announced a unilateral one-month ceasefire as a trust-building gesture amid peace negotiations aimed at producing bilateral ceasefire agreements between the government and the armed groups, local sources said. The Myanmar military has already imposed its own ceasefire in the region
The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Arakan Army (AA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), who refer to themselves as the Brotherhood Alliance, said in a statement that the ceasefire would be in effect from Monday through Oct. 8.
“In order to facilitate the peace negotiations, we have declared a one-month ceasefire,” Brigadier General Tar Phone Kyaw of the TNLA told The Irrawaddy on Monday.
“We will try to build trust with them for one month as a trial period,” he said.
On Aug. 31, the militaryannounceda three-week extension—until Sept. 21—of its unilateral ceasefire in five military commands in Kachin and northern Shan states. At that time, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun told The Irrawaddy the extension had been imposed “in order to continue the current peace negotiations led by the NRPC [National Reconciliation and Peace Center].” The ceasefire was first announced on Dec. 21, 2018, and extended on April 30, June 30 and Aug. 31.
In Monday’s statement, the Brotherhood Alliance vowed not to initiate any action against the Myanmar Army during the ceasefire period. However, the group would defend itself if attacked, it said.
“We will fight back at any time and in any place if they attack us,” it said.
The four members of the Northern Alliance (or NA, which comprises the Brotherhood Alliance plus the Kachin Independence Army) met with officials from the government’s NRPC in Keng Tung, eastern Shan State on Aug. 31. It was the first round of negotiations since the Brotherhood Alliance launched its offensive in northern Shan State and Mandalay Region’s Pyin Oo Lwin Township two weeks earlier.
The NA members and the NRPC agreed to resume negotiations on Sept. 16 and 17. However, the venue has yet to be agreed, with the NA proposing Panghsang, the capital of Wa Region, or somewhere in China.
On Aug. 15 the alliance of three ethnic armed groups attacked Myanmar army and government locations in Mandalay Region and northern Shan State in what it described as a counteroffensive in response to the Myanmar military’s recent offensives in Rakhine and Shan states.
The alliance first announced a halt to their offensive actions in a statement on Sept. 2 in which they said they planned to work toward signing individual bilateral ceasefire agreements with the Myanmar government.
Despite Monday’s announcement, a clash was reported in Shan’s Kutkai Township. Locals said they could hear artillery shelling in the area, though it was not known which groups were involved.
“We heard fighting for about an hour,” said Daw Bawk Hkawng, a resident of Kutkai town.
The fighting occurred in the Khung Lane section of Pang Lon, an ethnic Ta’ang village, she said.

The groups said the extension is aimed at facilitating the negotiation of bilateral ceasefire agreements, and reducing the fighting. “Our triple Brotherhood Alliance is ready to enforce a joint ceasefire if the Myanmar Tatmadaw is willing,” the statement reads.
However, they maintained their right to defend themselves if the Tatmadaw attacked their troops or camps, or conducted military operations in their territories; launched mortar, artillery or airstrikes in situations where the two sides’ troops were not directly engaged; or targeted civilians or blocked internally displaced persons (IDPs) from accessing food.
U Khin Zaw Oo, the secretary of the Peace Commission, described the statement as “constructive” and “a result of our negotiations.”
The latest discussions between government negotiators and representatives of the Northern Alliance, which comprises the Kachin Independence Army, MNDAA, TNLA and AA, were held in Kengtung, eastern Shan State on Tuesday.
Fighting in the area has intensified since November despite peace talks between the government’s negotiators and the Northern Alliance, organized with help from China.
The MNDAA, TNLA, and AA have troops operating in northern Shan State, and the AA also operates in Rakhine State. Clashes have occurred in Rakhine State since the AA first gained a foothold there in 2015, and began to intensify in November last year.
The peace talks resumed on Aug. 31 after the Brotherhood Alliance, as the three groups refer to themselves, stagedattacks on military and civilian targets on Aug. 15, killing 15 peopleincluding military and police personnel, as well as civilians. The attacks also seriously disrupted trade routes bound for the Muse trading zone on the China-Myanmar border in Shan State.

Title: Myanmar: A Violent Push to Shake Up Ceasefire Negotiations - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
A trio of ethnic armed groups have escalated their fight with the military in Myanmar’s Shan State. This alliance has long been outside the country’s peace process. With China’s help, the government should pursue bilateral ceasefires – and longer-term rapprochement – with the three organisations.
What’s new?On 15 August, an alliance of ethnic armed groups staged coordinated attacks against strategic targets in northern Myanmar. The offensive left up to fifteen people dead, and clashes reportedly continue in the northern part of Shan State, creating concerns for civilians’ safety.
Why did it happen?The three ethnic armed groups behind the attacks have been largely excluded from the peace process for the past five years. In recent months, the government has proposed bilateral ceasefires to the groups but has set unrealistic demands and accompanied the offers with military pressure.
Why does it matter?The attacks mark a serious escalation in Shan State’s conflict. They represent a rejection of bilateral ceasefire terms that the Myanmar government has proposed to the armed groups. While the Myanmar military has not yet responded with significant force, the brunt of mounting violence will inevitably fall on civilians.
Myanmar’s military has not retaliated in the heavy-handed way many observers expected, given the attacks’ provocative nature. Instead, it has focused on securing key infrastructure and reopening the highway to the border with China. Contrary to most expectations, the military has also extended its unilateral ceasefire from 31 August to 21 September. The government negotiating team has moved quickly to resume talks with the groups, with meetings held on 31 August and 17 September. On 9 September, the Brotherhood Alliance announced a one-month ceasefire but also warned that it would retaliate if attacked. China, which wields strong influence in the border areas and over some of the groups, has also been encouraging dialogue and de-escalation.
The Myanmar military could still decide to strike back, however. A counteroffensive would have dire consequences for the area’s civilian population, particularly ethnic Ta’ang (also referred to as Palaung), whom government forces suspect of providing support to the TNLA. Myanmar’s military and, to a lesser extent, the three ethnic armed groups have a history of human rights violations. Already, there are reports of indiscriminate shelling and mortar fire, as well as attacks on local aid groups’ vehicles and civilian cars and trucks on the highway. Thousands of residents have fled their homes, some pre-emptively out of fear of being targeted by forces on either side. Humanitarian access, which is already constrained, is likely to become more difficult.
Further clashes can and should be avoided. The Myanmar military’s extension of its unilateral ceasefire and the Brotherhood Alliance’s announcement of its own unilateral ceasefire are welcome steps. Both sides should continue to exercise restraint and also pursue negotiations aimed at reaching a bilateral ceasefire. Beyond that, the following steps could reduce civilian harm, reduce the likelihood of further violence and improve prospects for progress in the peace process:
All sides should allow humanitarian aid to reach those in need and ensure aid workers are not targeted or unnecessarily put at risk.
Naypyitaw should drop its insistence that the three groups return to their places of origin and abandon territorial gains. This demand is unrealistic and will hinder progress on bilateral ceasefires. The three groups’ inclusion in the peace process will be essential for future stability, if not progress toward a comprehensive peace settlement between Naypyitaw and Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups.
To enhance prospects for bilateral ceasefires, the military should broaden its unilateral ceasefire to Rakhine State and lengthen the time horizon.
China should also use its significant influence over both sides to encourage an end to the fighting.
II.New Targets, New Objective
In the early hours of 15 August, hundreds of Brotherhood Alliance fighters – predominantly TNLA soldiers – staged coordinated attacks on targets in Pyin Oo Lwin township, Mandalay Region and Naunghkio township, in northern Shan State. Targets included a battalion headquarters in Naunghkio; Pyin Oo Lwin’s Defence Services Technological Academy, which was hit by three 107mm rockets; a narcotics control checkpoint; the Goktwin bridge and a neighbouring police outpost on the Mandalay-Muse highway; and a military battalion. On 17 August, insurgents destroyed three more bridges on the route from Hseni to the border at Chinshwehaw, in Shan State’s Kokang region.
The attacks, which were successful partly because the targets were lightly guarded, have exacted a high economic toll. Though subsequent attempts to destroy bridges or attack battalions were less effective, and the assailants incurred significant casualties, the infrastructure damage and instability created have halted trade at two important border crossings, Muse and Chinshwehaw. Goods worth billions of dollars – mainly Myanmar’s agricultural products – pass through these points each year.
A significant attack was not unexpected. The groups had warned Myanmar’s military as far back as April 2019 to halt offensives in Rakhine State against the AA or face joint military action. On 12 August, they repeated the threat and announced the creation of the Brotherhood Alliance, which they seem to have formed for the purpose of carrying out the attack three days later. Not only did the three groups perceive a need to relieve pressure on the AA in Rakhine, but tensions between them and the government had been rising for some time due to negotiations over proposed ceasefire terms. For background on the three groups, see Appendix A.
What should be done?Both the Myanmar military and the armed groups should exercise restraint, allow humanitarian agencies to safely provide assistance and pursue ceasefire talks. The military and government should review their earlier ceasefire proposal, while China should continue to use its influence in Myanmar to encourage an end to the fighting.
I.Overview
On 15 August, a trio of ethnic armed groups calling themselves the Brotherhood Alliance staged coordinated attacks on targets in Myanmar’s Mandalay Region and Shan State, killing up to fifteen people, mostly soldiers and police officers. Clashes have recurred daily across northern Shan State since then, resulting in combatant deaths on both sides as well as civilian fatalities. The alliance – comprising the Arakan Army (AA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) – said it mounted the attacks in response to military aggression in both Rakhine and northern Shan States. The three groups had been negotiating bilateral ceasefires with the government that would have brought them into the broader peace process for the first time. However, unrealistic demands from Naypyitaw have undermined those negotiations, and the attacks represent a rejection of the government’s proposed terms. The government and military should moderate those terms, notably by abandoning their insistence that the groups give up territory they have acquired over the past five years.
The attacks on 15 August hit a Myanmar military training academy, a bridge and police outpost on an important highway, a military battalion and a narcotics control checkpoint. Myanmar’s military has alleged that they were payback for a recent raid on a drug production lab in northern Shan State. It says the key target was a narcotics control unit situated on the main highway running from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, to the border with China.
In truth, the attacks reflect longstanding tension over the status of Brotherhood Alliance members within Myanmar’s national peace process. Only signatories to the nationwide ceasefire agreement introduced in 2015 can take part in political negotiations with the government aimed at ending Myanmar’s civil conflicts. For most of the past five years, the Myanmar military (and, to a lesser extent, the civilian government) have excluded the three groups from this process, by setting stringent preconditions for talks toward signing the nationwide ceasefire.
More recently, the military and government have shifted their position, opening negotiations with each group aimed at individual bilateral ceasefires (they have also adopted this approach with a fourth ethnic armed group that does not have an existing bilateral ceasefire, the Kachin Independence Organisation). The bilateral negotiations, supported by neighbouring China, commenced in December 2018, when the three groups issued a statement pledging to stop “military actions” and expressing a desire for dialogue. The Myanmar military responded by announcing a unilateral ceasefire. Progress toward bilateral ceasefires had stalled in recent months, however. The government’s peace team put forward terms that were unfavourable to the insurgents – notably, a demand that they give up territory – while the Myanmar military continued to exert pressure on them in Rakhine and Shan States. Increasingly, the ethnic armed groups view both the unilateral ceasefire and the bilateral ceasefire negotiations as ploys to allow Naypyitaw to gain the upper hand rather than a genuine attempt to end the conflict.
An immediate goal of the attacks appears to have been to relieve pressure on AA forces in Rakhine State – an area not covered by the military’s unilateral ceasefire and that has seen significant fighting since January 2019 – by forcing the Myanmar military to shift forces to northern Shan State. But the Brotherhood Alliance members’ broader objective is to compel the Myanmar military and government to accept ceasefire terms that grant the groups political recognition, cement their territorial gains and potentially give them access to new economic opportunities. Toward these ends, the attacks appear aimed at forcing stronger intervention from China on the groups’ behalf.
The alliance had accused the military of putting forward an unrealistic proposal and, at the same time, trying to push back their forces so as to strengthen its negotiating position. Despite the military’s unilateral ceasefire, an increasing number of clashes had been reported in June and July, which the insurgents said were the result of military offensives aimed at dislodging them from areas in northern Shan State. More broadly, the three groups’ exclusion from Myanmar’s peace process has been a recurring source of conflict for much of the past five years, encouraging them to strengthen their forces and stage ever more dramatic attacks against targets in Shan and Rakhine States.
The attacks were notable for their apparent intent as much as their scale and impact. Though they bore similarities to the November 2016 offensive in northern Shan State (both targeted infrastructure and brought overland trade with China to a halt), this time the Brotherhood Alliance did not appear to be trying to acquire territory. This distinction also sets the latest attack apart from other notable offensives, such as in the Kokang region in February 2015 and in Rakhine State since January 2019. Instead, the intention appears to have been to inflict the maximum economic, strategic and psychological damage on government security forces with the minimum use of force.
The attacks were also deliberately provocative. The firing of rockets at the military academy in Pyin Oo Lwin – a garrison town on the edge of the Shan plateau, not far from Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city – is the closest that fighting has come to lowland Myanmar in many years. That the rockets hit the academy, killing one civilian and wounding a soldier, was surely a source of considerable embarrassment for the military.
The Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar army is called, has alleged that the attacks were revenge for a raid on drug production facilities in northern Shan State’s Kutkai. It claims that the key target was the narcotics control checkpoint, where soldiers were using drug detection equipment purchased from abroad. These allegations should be treated with caution, however. While the armed groups, particularly the AA, almost certainly have some connection to – indeed, may even be heavily involved in – the drug trade, the area in which the raids took place is also home to pro-government militias with long histories of drug production, against whom the military has rarely taken action. The military has put forward no solid evidence that would implicate any of the Brotherhood Alliance members in drug production at the raided factories, and the attacks would have been planned well in advance of the raids. Linking the attacks to the narcotics trade also serves the military’s interest in denigrating ethnic insurgents as criminals.
The Brotherhood Alliance most likely aimed this message not only at the Myanmar government and military but also at China, which is a significant stakeholder in the peace process. The attacks occurred along a corridor where Beijing plans to build roads and railways, as well as border trade zones, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. In May 2019, China Railway Eryuan Engineering submitted a technical report to the Myanmar government for the $9 billion project following a ground survey started in December 2018. Both Muse and Chinshwehaw are to host economic cooperation zones, with ground surveys already completed and a draft framework agreement nearing completion. By closing highways and halting trade, the attacks have caused significant economic damage and underlined risks to Chinese ambitions. The three groups appear to be trying to force Beijing to take a more active role in the peace process in the hope that this will tilt negotiations in their favour.
Despite the impact of the 15 August attacks, the immediate response from the Myanmar military has been subdued. The military has shifted some forces to northern Shan State to reinforce those already on the ground, but it has not yet committed large numbers of troops. There has been no sign of a major counteroffensive or counter-insurgency operation, and when military forces have repelled subsequent attacks they have not pursued retreating Brotherhood Alliance fighters. Instead, the military has concentrated on reopening the roads, particularly the Mandalay-Muse highway. Though a senior Myanmar military official described the attacks as “terrorism” and “a war crime”, he also underlined that the military was prepared to engage in peace talks.
On 31 August, the military extended its unilateral ceasefire for a further three weeks.
The lack of a counteroffensive may be a delaying tactic rather than a conciliatory gesture, however. The three-week extension could serve as a window for the military to prepare for a major retaliation. Some analysts also speculate that the military may be waiting to see whether the insurgents are planning further attacks before committing forces.
The fighting has inflicted a heavy toll on the local population, particularly around the town of Kutkai. At least 7,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since 15 August, and while many have returned, the situation remains fluid, with new displacement on a near-daily basis. It is unclear how many civilians have been killed or injured, but at least one died in a mortar attack on 18 August, while five were killed by artillery fire near Kutkai on 31 August. Humanitarian workers have not been spared: on 17 August, the leader of a Lashio-based volunteer group was killed when his vehicle, though marked as an ambulance, was hit by RPG and sniper fire attributed to the Brotherhood Alliance.
III.Unfinished Business
For the past five years, the status of the AA, TNLA and MNDAA has been a key – if not the most important – fault line in Myanmar’s peace process. For most of that time, the Myanmar military and government have sought to isolate the groups and, at times, exclude them from the national peace process, including the nationwide ceasefire agreement. Naypyitaw has chosen this course mainly because the three groups are fairly new. Though they have links to earlier armed groups, the AA and TNLA formed under the aegis of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) in the late 2000s and were intended as proxy forces. The Myanmar authorities’ concern was that acknowledging the groups – and any territory they had acquired – would only encourage more ethnic armies to form. At the same time, the authorities have allowed groups with almost no armed forces, such as the Arakan Liberation Party and Pa-Oh National Liberation Organization, to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement and participate in dialogue aimed at ending Myanmar’s conflicts.
Both the AA and TNLA have responded to this exclusion by strengthening their forces and expanding their territory so that they essentially become too significant and dangerous to ignore. Attention-grabbing attacks such as those that commenced on 15 August are important for demonstrating this capability. As one Yangon-based diplomat observed, “The AA was told back in 2014 that it was too small [to sign the nationwide ceasefire]. The Tatmadaw is essentially reaping what it has sown by shutting people out of the peace process”.
Though the MNDAA has a longer history, it suffered defeat at the Myanmar military’s hands in 2009 and only re-emerged in 2015. From February of that year it led efforts (with the support of the AA and TNLA) to retake control of the Kokang region in northern Shan State. These were mostly unsuccessful, but the fighting led to heavy casualties within the Myanmar military and strained Myanmar’s relationship with China. Following the Kokang campaign, the military labelled the three groups “terrorists” and refused to negotiate with them.
As a result, the peace process splintered. Eight armed groups based along the border with Thailand signed the nationwide ceasefire in October 2015, and, in the following year, they began political negotiations with the government and military through the Panglong-21 peace conference. But armed groups based in northern Myanmar, such as the powerful United Wa State Army (UWSA), refused to sign a nationwide ceasefire agreement, ostensibly because the AA, TNLA and MNDAA had been excluded.
In April 2017, seven groups that had not signed the nationwide ceasefire formed the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). Led by the UWSA, this coalition includes organisations that have bilateral ceasefires but have chosen not to sign the nationwide ceasefire, as well as those without bilateral ceasefires, such as the KIO and members of the Brotherhood Alliance. This new body initially rejected the nationwide ceasefire agreement outright, but it has since said that its members will consider signing once the AA, TNLA, MNDAA and KIO have reached bilateral ceasefires with the government, and are therefore eligible to consider signing the nationwide accord.
Over time, political and military realities, including China’s influence over the peace process, have forced the Myanmar military and government to review their position toward the three groups. In the second half of 2018, Beijing began brokering informal meetings between them and the government’s Peace Commission. These resulted in the trio issuing a statement in December pledging to stop “military actions” and expressing a desire for negotiations.
The Myanmar military responded on 21 December by declaring a unilateral ceasefire in Kachin and Shan States to last until 30 April 2019. The ceasefire was severely tested just two weeks later, when the AA staged coordinated attacks on police outposts in northern Rakhine State on 4 January, leaving thirteen officers dead and prompting heavy fighting. But the Myanmar military and government have continued to pursue talks with the Brotherhood Alliance’s three members, along with the KIO. The military extended its unilateral ceasefire to 30 June, then again to 31 August and now a third time to 21 September.
For the government and military, bilateral ceasefires are a step toward the groups signing the nationwide ceasefire agreement, which is a prerequisite for participation in political dialogue aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace agreement that would end Myanmar’s conflicts. For the Brotherhood Alliance, bilateral ceasefires are more a means of securing political recognition, cementing territorial gains and potentially getting access to new economic opportunities.
The terms of proposed bilateral ceasefires with the Brotherhood Alliance members have been a sticking point, however. The groups put forward proposals at talks in Muse on 30 April, pushing for a formal role for China. Two months later, at a meeting in Mong La in eastern Shan State, the government’s peace team responded with its draft, which had essentially come from the military. This version removed the Chinese role and also required the groups to return to their so-called places of origin – meaning that the AA would have to leave Rakhine State and return to areas controlled by the KIO, while the TNLA and AA would also have to give up significant territory.
For all three, but particularly the AA, these demands are non-starters, and came at a time when they were facing military pressure in both Rakhine and northern Shan States. “If the Brotherhood Alliance doesn’t see a clear path forward for negotiations and there is also military pressure, they have to focus on the military necessity”, commented one source close to the groups.
Following the August attacks, the government’s National Reconciliation and Peace Centre moved quickly to arrange a meeting in Kengtung, eastern Shan State, with the three groups and the KIO. The talks focused on ending the recent fighting and resuming progress toward a bilateral agreement. Significantly, they agreed to hold talks with the military on “deployment of forces, and rules and procedures to prevent outbreak of fighting”. As a confidence-building measure, the Brotherhood Alliance also announced a one-month unilateral ceasefire on 9 September, but at the same time warned that they would defend themselves if attacked, including with artillery or from the air by plane or helicopter.
A second meeting took place on 17 September in Kengtung, this time with senior military officers and the attorney general present. Again there was no breakthrough, but the presence of the Myanmar military meant the two sides were at least able to discuss issues such as troop deployments. They have agreed to meet again, most likely in October, and the military is expected to extend its unilateral ceasefire for about another month.
These immediate efforts at dialogue are positive, but further progress will likely require the military and government to propose revised ceasefire terms. The alternatives are unpalatable: leave the groups out of the peace process, running the risk of further conflict; or seek a military victory, which would be devastating for local populations and stretch military resources. Both options would almost certainly hinder economic development, including China-backed mega-projects, in northern Shan State.
China has responded quickly to the attacks and may have used its influence to avoid a significant escalation. On 19 August, its foreign ministry “strongly condemned” the strikes and said it would continue to support the peace process in a “positive way”. The following day, its special envoy for Asian affairs, Sun Guoxiang, met representatives from the three armed groups, urging them to halt attacks and meet the government for fresh talks. Though the meeting took place on 31 August, China has been unable or unwilling to bring fighting to a complete halt. It is wary of becoming involved beyond its current mediator role and risking being perceived as taking sides in the conflict.
The KIO neither took part in the August attacks nor gave them its official endorsement. Previously, the KIO’s northern Shan brigades were part of the Northern Alliance, a bloc that included the AA, TNLA and MNDAA and staged the offensive in northern Shan State in November 2016. In contrast, it has not joined the new Brotherhood Alliance and did not commit troops to the attacks launched on 15 August. After eight years of warfare, the KIO is less eager to fight than the other three groups. It also has complaints about the bilateral ceasefire proposal put forward by the government but, unlike the three groups in the Brotherhood Alliance, would not have to give up territory. With its status within the peace process assured, the KIO also has different political goals; in particular, it wants to make progress on the return or resettlement of almost 100,000 internally displaced persons in Kachin State.
IV. Conclusion
The attacks launched on 15 August in northern Shan State were unusual in their boldness but should not have come as a surprise, given rising tensions over ceasefire negotiations and recent Myanmar military pressure. The Brotherhood Alliance’s objectives were to underline its ability to strike at key economic infrastructure, to shift pressure off AA forces in Rakhine State and to reset bilateral ceasefire talks. The Myanmar military’s response has so far been subdued. But there is no guarantee that its restraint will continue; a major counteroffensive is still possible. The willingness of both sides to engage in dialogue is promising, but given recent disagreements, a fundamental rethink of negotiations will be required to improve prospects for bilateral ceasefires.
As long as the three groups remain outside the peace process, prospects for an end to Myanmar’s conflicts remain dim. Their status has been the pivotal issue in the process for the past five years, causing fragmentation among Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups that has undermined efforts at dialogue. Bilateral ceasefires that bring the three insurgent groups into the peace process would be an important step forward, if only because it would mean an immediate end to fighting in large parts of Rakhine and Shan States. The insistence that the groups give up territorial gains is unrealistic, however, particularly for the AA, and Naypyitaw should abandon it. If the 15 August attacks represent a rejection of this current ceasefire proposal, they are also a push for the status enjoyed by most of Myanmar’s other armed groups – many of which have far less military capacity and public support. Such recognition seems inevitable both for the parties to reach bilateral ceasefires and for the peace process to be able to move forward with credibility and legitimacy.
In the meantime, both sides should adhere to their respective unilateral ceasefires and refrain from further attacks, particularly those that might put civilians at risk. They must also allow aid to reach those in need and ensure that aid workers are not targeted or put at unnecessary risk. To give renewed impetus to bilateral ceasefire negotiations, the military should broaden its unilateral ceasefire to Rakhine State and lengthen the time horizon. Given its significant influence over both parties, China is well placed to encourage an end to the fighting and renewed dialogue.
Yangon/Brussels, 24 September 2019
Appendix A: Who’s Who in the Brotherhood Alliance
The Arakan Army (AA)was formed in 2009 under the patronage of the Kachin Independence Organisation at its headquarters on the China border in Laiza. The group emerged as a serious force from 2015, when it began participating in attacks in Shan State together with the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Kachin Independence Organisation. Around this time, its fighters also began to infiltrate into southern Chin State, close to the border with Rakhine State. In January 2019, it launched major attacks in Rakhine State and has been engaged in heavy fighting with the military there for the past nine months.
The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)traces its roots to the Palaung State Liberation Army formed in 1963. After the latter signed a ceasefire with the military government in 1991, remnant forces in Kayin State continued to fight against the military together with the Karen National Union as the Palaung State Liberation Front. The Front was largely inactive, however, until 2009, when it established the TNLA as its new armed wing, under the patronage of the Kachin Independence Organisation. The TNLA has fought regularly against not only the Myanmar military but also militias allied to the military, such as the Pansay militia, and the Shan State Army-South, the armed wing of the Restoration Council of Shan State.
The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA)was formed after forces led by Pheung Kya-Shin (Peng Jiasheng) broke away from the collapsing Communist Party of Burma in 1989. It was the first ethnic armed group to sign a ceasefire with Myanmar’s military regime, which had taken power the previous year. The ceasefire held for two decades until 2009, when the Myanmar military invaded the Kokang region after the MNDAA refused to become a Border Guard Force under military control. The military ousted Pheung Kya-Shin and put a rival faction in charge of the Kokang region. In 2015, the MNDAA, with AA and TNLA support, staged a surprise offensive in an effort to retake the Kokang region. While largely unsuccessful, this operation inflicted significant casualties on the Myanmar military and reshaped the peace process.

Title: Fighting in Myanmar Leaves Young Women Vulnerable to Trafficking, Forced Marriage 
No media source currently available
On-going fighting between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has led to economic hardships resulting from land losses, displacement and family separation. Many young Burmese women seek work in neighboring China, making them more vulnerable to human trafficking and forced marriages. Steve Sandford spoke with local activists and former victims in northern Myanmar about the impact of human trafficking and filed this report.
