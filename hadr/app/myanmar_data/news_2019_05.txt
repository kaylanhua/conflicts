New technologies, keen strategies and a sharpened focus keep offshore operators determined and decisive. Activity is picking up, and these key players are focused on increasing profits and production.
Offshore the U.K., the production forecast is looking more positive. “Development activity in the U.K. offshore sector is expected to improve after historical lows in the past few years,” according to a March 2019 GlobalData report. “There are 16 planned greenfield projects with identified development plans and 29 announced greenfield projects forecast to start production between 2019 and 2025. These are estimated to cost around $6.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively.”
In other areas, such as offshore Argentina, exploration is the main focus for operators. “Any big discovery in Argentina’s offshore frontier area will be a great prize for companies looking into building up a portfolio for future development. However, such long-term strategies will compete with a current preference for exploration in offshore areas with more seismic and well information available and where logistics to commercialize production is already known,” GlobalData said in a September 2018 report.
Moreover, E&P activity has heightened drastically in the Gulf of Mexico in the last year. Wood Mackenzie recently reported that 2019 “is shaping up to be a good one in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with the first increase in drilling in four years, first-ever production from a Jurassic play, key new project sanctions and an uptick in M&A [mergers and acquisitions] all in the cards.” Wood Mackenzie expects exploration activity to increase 30% this year. “Shell and Chevron will lead the way, but the actual growth in exploration will come from new entrants—Kosmos Energy, Equinor, Total, Murphy and Fieldwood,” the report stated.
The following is a sampling of offshore operators, their recent production updates and strategies moving forward.
Editor’s Note:This article originally appeared in May's print issue ofE&Pmagazine. These profiles were written based on fourth-quarter and year-end 2018 reports as well as 2018 and early 2019 press releases. As of press time in late March/early April, first-quarter 2019 results had not been released. If available, updates have been posted beneath each company profile.
Aker BP is the operator for Valhall, Ula, Ivar Aasen, Alvheim and Skarv offshore field centers. According to the company, it is one of the biggest independent listed oil and gas companies in Europe, measured by production. The company’s net production in 2018 was 155,700 boe/d, and total production volume was 56.8 MMboe. In the fourth quarter of 2018 production volumes increased due to improved efficiency and new wells, according to the company.
According to the company’s fourth-quarter 2018 report released on Feb. 6, “Aker BP continued its positive development and strong growth in 2018. Total income increased by 46% from 2017 and all major field development projects progressed as planned. Reserve replacement was above 100%, and the company continued to grow its resource base through acquisitions and exploration success.”
In the development arena, Aker BP said Phase 1 of the Johan Sverdrup development project is progressing steadily toward planned production start in November 2019. “Johan Sverdrup is a major discovery and ranks among the five largest oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf [NCS],” the company said on its website. “The development of the field will be one of the key industrial projects in Norway over the next 50 years.”
The company is an active explorer on the NCS. “In recent years about two-thirds of Aker BP’s exploration budget has been invested in the mature areas in the North Sea, where the infrastructure is good and the discovery rate is still high. The remaining resources have been invested primarily in the Barents Sea and in the more immature areas in the North Sea,” the company said.
Aker BP reported fourth-quarter 2018 production of 58,400 boe/d for the Alvheim area, 23,300 boe/d for Ivar Aasen, 23,500 boe/d for Skarv, 8,400 boe/d for the Ula area and 39,600 boe/d for the Valhall area, according to the report.
In the Alvheim area, the Skogul project is progressing according to plan and production start is scheduled for the first quarter of 2020, the report stated. In the first quarter of 2018, an oil discovery was made in the Frosk prospect near the Bøyla Field, and a new well was scheduled to be drilled in the first half of 2019. Aker BP will continue its exploration of the Frosk area this year.
In the Valhall area, drilling from the IP platform continued with the G22 well coming onstream during the fourth quarter of 2018. The G11 well was subsequently drilled and completed using the Fishbones technology in one section of the well. Test production began in February.
In the Ula area, development of the field is in its final stages. Drilling operations were completed in the fourth quarter last year. As of Feb. 6, Aker BP is performing the final preparations to start production, which is expected during the first half of the year, the report stated. There is the possibility the company will add a new platform at Ula in mid-2020.
Additionally, “Aker BP considers the resource potential in the Ula area to be significant, both from increased oil recovery in the Ula and Tambar fields, from potential tiebacks of other discoveries including the newly acquired King Lear discovery, and from exploration opportunities,” according to the report.
In the Skarv area, production start for the Ærfugl development is planned for the fourth quarter of 2020.

BHP, formerly known as BHP Billiton, has operating assets in the Shenzi, Neptune, Atlantis and Mad Dog fields in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) as well as in several fields offshore Australia. Other offshore production operations are located in the Greater Angostura Field offshore Trinidad and Tobago. Petroleum exploration expenditure for the second half of 2018 was $316 million, and activity for the period was largely focused in the GoM and Trinidad and Tobago, according to BHP’s second-half 2018 results report released Feb. 19. This year a $750 million exploration and appraisal program is being executed.
In the U.S. GoM, “Samurai-2 and Samurai-2 ST01 drilling has delineated the accumulation of oil,” the report stated. “Further appraisal and development planning at Samurai is in progress. In the southern portion of the Wildling sub-basin, we continue to assess the potential resource, with further appraisal drilling now expected in the 2020 financial year.”
In the Western U.S. GoM, an ocean-bottom node seismic acquisition was completed in early January 2019 and processed data are expected to be delivered during March 2020. “This is the world’s first deepwater exploration ocean-bottom node seismic acquisition,” according to the company.
In addition, BHP spudded the Trion-2DEL appraisal well in the GoM in November 2018 and encountered oil in line with expectations. “This was followed by a planned downdip geologic sidetrack, which encountered oil and water, as predicted, further appraising the field and delineating the resource,” the report stated. “Following the recent encouraging results in the Trion Block, an additional appraisal well (3DEL) to further delineate the scale and characterization of the resource is expected to be drilled in the second half of 2019.”
Looking ahead, other major projects include the development of the Atlantis Phase 3 project in the deepwater GoM.
Offshore Trinidad and Tobago, the company encountered hydrocarbons at the Bongos-2 exploration well in the first half of 2019, and Phase 3 of BHP’s deepwater exploration drilling campaign will start in the second half of the year, according to the report. Phase 3 will test three wells on three prospects in the northern license area.
Offshore Eastern Canada, BHP was the successful bidder in October 2018 for licenses in the Orphan Basin, and the company has begun working with the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board to meet all regulatory requirements for the exploration phase. The licenses became effective in January.

April 17 update from company:BHP Operational Review for the nine months ended 31 March 2019
BP has offshore operations and development projects in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and offshore Trinidad and Tobago, the U.K., Egypt and Australia.
As of February, BP had already completed three major upstream project startups this year: Constellation in the U.S. GoM, the second stage of the West Nile Delta development offshore Egypt and gas production at Angelin offshore Trinidad.
In the last few years, BP has been very active in West Africa, accessing about 80,000 sq km (30,888 sq miles) of acreage with resource potential of 8 Bboe.
“In drilling, over 70% of our offshore wells are now top quartile—from 25% just five years ago. And during the same period, our percentage of nonproductive time for completions has reduced by around 30%,” Bernard Looney, BP’s Upstream chief executive, said during an investor day presentation in December 2018. “Mad Dog 2 [in the GoM] is a great example of our drilling performance. …Three of our last four wells are the best ever drilled.”
Over the next few years, the company plans on wrapping up construction projects for Angelin offshore Trinidad, Constellation in the GoM, Culzean in the North Sea and West Nile Delta-Raven offshore Egypt this year; the KG D6 R-Series in the Bay of Bengal, Alligin and Vorlich in the North Sea, and Zinia 2 offshore Angola in 2020; and Mad Dog Phase 2 in the GoM, KG D6 Satellites and Manuel in the GoM in 2021.
In addition, the company has had a strong focus on improving efficiencies via new technology developments and upgrades. “In Trinidad we are using the latest digital modeling technology—think 3-D visualization of our offshore facilities. This allows us to complete detailed activity planning on our normally unmanned installations without having to go offshore, improving safety through reduced visits and saving $450,000 so far,” Looney said.
“In the Gulf of Mexico, our project teams have been using our latest agile ways of working and challenging themselves to bring our new subsea tiebacks online quicker. They are making good progress with seven tiebacks either in execute or operate with an average 10-month improvement in cycle time.”
He also noted that the application of seismic techniques, like ocean-bottom nodes, full waveform inversion and new ways of working at Thunder Horse, has unlocked an additional 1 Bbbl of oil in place (gross). “We now see the potential for the GoM to run at around 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through the middle of the next decade,” he said.

Chevron, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, has offshore projects located in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) as well as offshore Western Australia, New Zealand, South America, the U.K., West Africa and in the Gulf of Thailand.
During 2018, net daily production in the GoM averaged 186,000 bbl of crude oil, 3.3 MMcm (117 MMcf) of natural gas and 13,000 bbl of NGL, according to the company’s 2018 annual report supplement. As of early 2019, Chevron has an interest in 218 leases in the GoM. At year-end 2018, the company was the second largest leaseholder in the GoM.
Chevron’s signature deepwater project in the GoM is Jack/St. Malo, which is located about 451 km (280 miles) south of New Orleans. The project’s development phases progressed in 2018; Stage 2 was accomplished with all four wells on production and Stage 3 advanced, as two of the three planned wells were completed. Stage 4 includes water injection at the St. Malo Field and is expected to reach a final investment decision in the third quarter of 2019. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields averaged 139,000 bbl of liquids (71,000 net) and 594,654 cu. m (21 MMcf) of natural gas (11 million net) last year, according to the 2018 annual report supplement.
Also in the GoM, the Chevron-operated Big Foot deepwater project, located 362 km (225 miles) south of New Orleans, achieved first oil in November 2018 with ramp-up expected to continue during 2019. The field is estimated to contain total recoverable resources in excess of 200 MMboe, according to the company.
At the Tahiti Field, 2018 net daily production averaged 51,000 bbl of crude oil, 622,971 cu. m (22 MMcf) of natural gas and 3,000 bbl of NGL. The Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project is developing shallower reservoirs and achieved first oil from three wells in June 2018, and the fourth well was scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2019.
Chevron also operates the Anchor Field located in the Green Canyon area off the coast of Louisiana. FEED activities commenced in 2018. The planned facility has a design capacity of 75,000 bbl/d of crude oil and 792,872 cu. m/d (28 MMcf/d) of natural gas, according to the 2018 annual report supplement. The total potentially recoverable oil-equivalent resources for Anchor are estimated to exceed 450 MMbbl.
In January 2018, Chevron announced a significant oil discovery at the Ballymore prospect in the Mississippi Canyon area in the deepwater GoM. The initial Ballymore well reached total measured depth of 8,898 m (29,194 ft) and encountered more than 204 m (670 ft) net oil pay with excellent reservoir and fluid characteristics, according to the company.
Offshore Western Australia, the Jansz-Io gas field is part of the Chevron-operated Gorgon project. In March 2019, Chevron contracted Aker Solutions to support delivery of a subsea compression system for the Jansz-Io with the aim of recovering gas more cost-effectively and with a smaller environmental footprint, according to news reports.
Jeff Schmoll, Chevron Australia’s general manager for major capital projects, said in March that “the Jansz-Io compression project will prolong the life of Gorgon’s Jansz-Io fields and was part of the original development plan for the project,” according to aminingweekly.comreport.
Offshore Brazil, Chevron won six deepwater blocks in the presalt trend within the Campos and Santos basins in 2018. The six new blocks in the Brazil presalt cover 470,000 net acres.
On April 12 Chevron Corp. entered into a definitive agreement with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Anadarko. The total enterprise value of the transaction is $50 billion, according to a press release. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year.

Upstream company ConocoPhillips has offshore operations located in the North Sea and offshore China, Indonesia and Malaysia as well as nonoperated assets in several offshore areas worldwide.
ConocoPhillips has significant developments offshore the U.K. in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea. Operated assets in Europe include the Greater Britannia and J-Area fields in the U.K. and the Greater Ekofisk Area in Norway.
“The company has leveraged its existing operations, infrastructure and basin expertise to create incremental growth projects in recent years, and development opportunities still exist in ConocoPhillips’ legacy areas in the North Sea,” according to the company’s website. “Production from the Southern North Sea in the U.K. ceased in 2018, and the focus of activity has now changed to decommissioning.”
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company achieved first production from the Aasta Hansteen project in the Norwegian Sea and the Clair Ridge project west of the Shetland Islands, according to the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results report.
ConocoPhillips also produces from fields in Bohai Bay offshore China. Block 11/05 in the Bohai Sea contains the Penglai 19-3, 19-9 and 25-6 oil fields, in which ConocoPhillips has 49% interest and CNOOC (the operator) has 51% interest. The project had 36 wells completed and online as of year-end 2018. According to a March 2019 company fact sheet, the Penglai 25-6 Phase 4A project was sanctioned by ConocoPhillips in 2018, and this project consists of one new wellhead platform that could add up to 62 wells. First production from Phase 4A is expected in 2021. Additional appraisal drilling and development studies are underway to assess further Penglai development opportunities. A full-field 3-D seismic program at Penglai continued in 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2019. The production periods for Penglai 19-9, 19-3 and 25-6 end in 2027, 2037 and 2045, respectively. ConocoPhillips reported 2018 average net production of 30,000 bbl/d of crude oil and 30,000 boe/d in Penglai.
In the South China Sea, one ILX well in the CNOOC-operated Panyu 4-1 area will be drilled prior to April 2020. The production period for the Panyu 4-1 area is 15 years upon commencement of commercial production, the fact sheet stated. ConocoPhillips has 49% interest in Panyu 4-1.
In Malaysia, ConocoPhillips holds 2.2 million net acres across six blocks in varying stages of exploration, development and production. Three of these blocks are located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G, Block J and the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). Three other blocks, Block SK304, Block SK313 and Block WL4-00, are operated by ConocoPhillips and are located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak. Production growth continues from several fields in Block G, Block J and the KBBC.
Offshore Australia, ConocoPhillips is the operator (with 56.9% interest) of the Bayu-Undan Field in the Timor Sea. Last year the final development phase at Bayu-Undan was completed.

Eni’s primary offshore operations are located off the coast of Africa, Indonesia, Mexico and Norway, though the company has interests in other offshore areas.
Offshore Algeria, Eni, Sonatrach and Total signed two agreements that include an exclusive partnership for offshore exploration in Algeria in a virtually unexplored geological province.
In Egypt, Eni operates through its subsidiary leoc. In March the company announced a new gas discovery in the Nour prospect in the Eastern Egyptian Mediterranean offshore Egypt, a press release stated. Eni is the operator (40% stake), with BP (25%), Mubadala Petroleum (20%) and Tharwa Petroleum Co. (15%).
Throughout 2018 and again in March of this year, Eni announced several new oil discoveries offshore Angola. “Agogo is the third discovery of commercial nature since the Block 15/06 Consortium decided to launch a new exploration campaign in 2018, leading to the discoveries of Kalimba and Afoxé,” according to a March 2019 press release. “The [latest] discovery opens new opportunities for oil exploration below salt diapirs in the northwest part of the prolific Block 15/06, thus creating new chances for unlocking additional potential value.”
Eni is the operator of Block 15/06 (36.8% interest), along with partners Sonangol P&P (36.8%) and SSI Fifteen Ltd. (26.3%). According to the release, the companies plan on appraising the discovery and starting the studies to fast track the block’s development.
Offshore Ghana, Eni started gas production in July 2018 from the Sankofa Field in the Offshore Cape Three Points Integrated Oil and Gas Project. “The field will provide 180 million standard cubic feet per day [5.1 MMcm/d] for at least 15 years, enough to convert to gas half of Ghana’s power generation capacity,” a press release stated.
In December 2018, Eni announced a Merakes East gas discovery in the East Sepinggan Block offshore Indonesia, a press release stated. Eni is the operator of the East Sepinggan contract area through its subsidiary Eni East Sepinggan Ltd. (85% interest) with PT Pertamina Hulu Energi East Sepinggan (15%).
Offshore Mexico, Eni’s wholly owned subsidiary Eni Mexico S. de R. L. de C. V. holds rights in six E&P blocks in the Sureste Basin, all as the operator. In October 2018, Eni signed a participating interest swap with Lukoil whereby Eni gave Lukoil a 20% stake in both the production-sharing contracts (PSC) for blocks 10 and 14, and at the same time acquired a 40% stake in Lukoil’s PSC for Block 12.
In October 2018, Eni announced a new oil discovery in the western Barents Sea offshore Norway. Equinor is the operator in the Skruis Prospect in PL 532 (50% interest), along with Eni (30%) and Petoro (20%). “The well will be permanently plugged and abandoned after an extensive data collection and sampling program,” a press release stated. “The Skruis discovery is part of Eni’s near-field exploration strategy that, in case of success, allows the exploitation of these thanks to the synergies with future infrastructures.”

In addition to its name change of Statoil to Equinor in May 2018, the Norwegian multinational energy company has had quite an eventful 2018 and 2019.
In April 2018, in partnership with Total, the company acquired Cobalt International Energy’s 60% operated interest in the North Platte discovery in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $339 million.
In Brazil, Equinor has interests in the BM-S-8 and Carcará North in the presalt area of the Santos Basin as well as in the BM-C-33 in the Campos Basin, containing the Pão de Açúcar discovery. In June 2018, Equinor deepened its position in Brazil’s presalt area with 28% interest in the Uirapuru production-sharing contract in the Santos Basin.
In March 2018, the company acquired 50% interest in two offshore wind development projects offshore Poland.
On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), Equinor was awarded 31 new exploration licenses early last year.
In November 2018, Equinor began construction of theJohan Castbergvessel at Kværner’s yard at Stord. “Johan Castbergis the next major development on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and will open a new area in the Barents Sea for Equinor. Johan Castberg’s development will have ripple effects equivalent to 47,000 man-years in Norway during the development phase,” said Anders Opedal, Equinor’s executive vice president for technology, projects and drilling, in a press release.
In December 2018, Equinor (operator) and partners began production at the deepwater Aasta Hansteen Field on the NCS. The Aasta Hansteen is the first deepwater development on the NCS and the world’s largest single-point articulated riser platform, according to a press release.
Earlier this year, Equinor and its partners, Petoro, Exxon Mobil and Total, have proven gas and condensate in the Norwegian Sea Ragnfrid North (6406/2-9 S) exploration well. Recoverable resources are estimated at 6 MMboe to 25 MMboe, a January press release stated.
In March Equinor received approval for extending the life of eight installations on the NCS: Gullfaks A, B and C (2036), Oseberg East (2031), Snorre A and B (2040), Norne (2036) and Åsgard A (2030), a press release stated. Equinor plans to extend the life of more than 20 NCS installations in total and expects to apply for extending the life of all older and relevant installations by 2031.
The company also has been busy offshore the U.K.  In March 2018, the company became the operator of the Martin Linge Field and Garatiana discovery in the North Sea. Then in the second half of 2018, Equinor acquired a 40% operator share in the Rosebank project on the U.K. Continental Shelf from Chevron. Other partners in the field are Suncor Energy (40%) and Siccar Point Energy (20%). This “agreement allows [Equinor] to buy back into an asset in which we previously had a participating interest, demonstrating our strategy of creating value through oil price cycles,” said Al Cook, Equinor’s executive vice president for global strategy and business development and U.K. country manager, in a press release.
In October 2018, the company started production at the Oseberg Vestflanken 2 Field in the North Sea. “Remote-operated from the Oseberg field center, the new Oseberg H platform is the first unmanned platform on the Norwegian Continental Shelf,” according to a press release.
In addition, in March of this year, Equinor (operator) and its partners, Petoro, ConocoPhillips and Repsol, made an oil discovery from the Visund A platform in the Telesto exploration well in the North Sea. The resources are estimated at 12 MMbbl to 28 MMbbl of recoverable oil, a press release stated.

ONGC also is working on its mega deepwater development initiative for integrated development of the KG-DWN-98/2 (Cluster-2) Project off the east coast of India. “Cluster-2 development will have water depths ranging from 350 m to 1,400 m [1,148 ft to 4,593 ft] and is one of the most capital-intensive and technologically challenging projects off the east coast of India,” the company said in an October 2018 press release. “Total peak gas production rate from Cluster-2 is envisaged to be about 16 MMscm/d [million metric standard cubic meter per day] and have a peak oil production rate of 80,000 bbl/d.”
The company expects first gas production by December 2019, first oil by March 2021 and overall project completion by August 2021, according to the release.
In addition, ONGC has set up four 3-D virtual reality centers known as “Third Eye” for real-time dissemination and information of onshore and offshore applications. These centers are used for E&P activities including real-time surveillance of producing oil and gas fields.
Mexican state oil company Pemex reported that 82% of its crude oil production and 55% of its natural gas production is based offshore, according to its fourth-quarter 2018 results report. The company also reported that 54% of its development rigs and 54% of its exploration rigs were designated for offshore operations.
In 2018, 143 development wells were completed. Production from these fields amounted to 52,000 bbl/d of crude oil and 1.2 MMcm/d (43 MMcf/d) of gas, according to the report. Out of these 143 wells, 21 were offshore.
In deep waters, delineation well Doctus-1DL was successfully concluded, providing information leading to a new development area of light crude oil in the Perdido Area, the company stated in the report.
Additionally, Pemex expects to add 210,000 bbl/d and 9.9 MMcm (350 MMcf/d) of new production by year-end 2020 from the development of six shallow-water fields in the Gulf of Campeche, according to an October 2018 S&P Global Platts article. In the article, CEO Carlos Trevino said the six fields are at different phases: Xikin and Esah are in development, Koban and Kinbe are being assessed, and Mulach and Manik are in the early stages of exploration.
In October 2018, Pemex discovered seven reservoirs in two new wells in Mexico’s Southeast Basin, named Manik-101A and Mulach-1, according to a company press release. The two wells are estimated to produce more than 180 MMboe in 3P reserves.
Pemex also is assessing its Kinbe and Koban fields. The Kinbe Field, located 28 km (17 miles) from Tabasco, Mexico, is expected to produce light crude. The Kinbe-1 well produced more than 5,000 bbl/d during production trials, and Kinbe holds 3P reserves estimated at more than 120 MMboe, according to a press release. Pemex also is delineating its Koban Field. The Koban well holds gas and condensate with estimated 3P reserves of 205 MMboe.
In an October 2018 press release, Pemex said it would soon begin developing its Xikin and Esah shallow-water fields. Both fields hold a combined 360 MMboe of 3P reserves. Xikin is in shallow waters 24 km (15 miles) from the coast of Tabasco, Mexico. The total depth of the field is located between 6,400 m and 7,050 m and will produce light oil. It has 3P reserves estimated to be about 230 MMboe. Esah is located 94 km (58 miles) from Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche. The field will primarily produce crude with 3P reserves of 130 MMboe.

According to the report, the company’s 2019 upstream activity outlook includes offshore fabrications (five to six wellhead platforms and one to two central processing platforms), offshore installations (eight to nine projects for heavy-lift barge and three to four projects for pipelay barge), floaters (one aframax),underwater services (DP2 support vessels), marine vessels and decommissioning (one wellhead platform, three subsea trees, one FSO and 50 wells).
Santos Ltd.’s upstream offshore assets are located off the coasts of northern and western Australia.
In November 2018, Santos enhanced its position in western Australia through the acquisition of Quadrant Energy.
Offshore the North West Cape, the Van Gogh and Coniston/Novara oil fields are serviced by theNingaloo VisionFPSO vessel and the Pyrenees oil project includes oil from the Crosby, Ravensworth and Stickle fields and thePyrenees VentureFPSO vessel.
In addition, the company has had exploration success in the Carnarvon’s Bedout sub-basin with the Dorado and Roc discoveries and in the Crown and Lasseter discoveries in the Browse Basin.
The company’s offshore resource positions across northern Australia include the Crown-Lasseter discoveries in the Browse Basin (Santos 30%) and the Petrel-Tern discoveries in the Bonaparte Basin (Santos 35% to 40%).
In February 2018, Santos reached an agreement with Beach Energy to become 50:50 joint venture partners across NT/P82, NT/P85, NT/P84 and WA-454-P in the Bonaparte Basin offshore Northern Australia. Santos will operate all four permits.

One of Saudi Aramco’s recent developments is the offshore Manifa oilfield megaproject located in the Arabian Gulf. Instead of building 30 offshore platforms, the company converted more than 70% of the field into an onshore field to avoid damaging the ecosystem. The design involved the creation of 27 man-made islands, all made from 45 MMcm (1.5 Bcf) of sand reclaimed from the seabed. The islands act as onshore drill sites above the offshore oil field, and they support equipment while elevated bridges allow normal flows of currents and sea life to continue. The development includes 14 bridges, 13 offshore platforms, 15 onshore drill sites, 350 new wells, injection facilities, multiple pipelines and a 420-MW heat and electricity plant. In 2017 the company reached its target of 900,000 bbl/d of oil.
“The result of the collaborative effort was an innovative plan to reach Manifa Field—primarily located in shallow water—through building a world-class causeway, bridges and laterals to connect the man-made islands,” the company stated in a 2017 media release. “The computerized modeling of the 27 drilling islands, connected by a 42-kilometer [26-mile] causeway and 14 bridges to allow natural water circulation at Manifa Bay, has significantly contributed to enhance the natural flow of water, maintaining the bay as a perfect environment for shrimp and fish populations to grow.”
Saudi Aramco said Manifa is one of the world’s largest engineering projects, noting that the construction phase alone required more than 4 million man-hours to complete, according to news reports.
In December 2017, Saudi Aramco released a new AUV that can conduct offshore platform debris surveys to identify seabed clearance and potential debris, a press release stated.

Shell operates in more than 70 countries and has offshore operations across the world.
In the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Shell’s operations produce about 355,000 boe/d, more than 50% of the company’s U.S. oil and gas production. The company has an interest in about 400 federal offshore production leases.
Shell’s largest operated deepwater assets in the GoM include Auger, Mars, Olympus, Perdido, Ursa, Appomattox and Stones.
Last year Shell announced one of its largest U.S. GoM exploration finds in the last 10 years from the Whale deepwater well, in which Shell is the operator with 60% interest, according to the company’s 2018 annual report. It was discovered in the Alaminos Canyon Block 772.
In April 2018, Shell announced the final investment decision to develop the deepwater Vito Field (Shell has 63.1% interest). The field is expected to reach an average peak production of 100,000 boe/d, the report stated. The company also has continued with the development of the Appomattox project, with first oil expected this year.
In May 2018, Shell announced a large exploration discovery in the Norphlet geologic play from the Dover deepwater well. The Shell-operated Dover is the company’s sixth discovery in the Norphlet and is located about 20 km (12 miles) from the Appomattox platform.
Also in May 2018, production started from the Kaikias deepwater project (80% interest). Kaikias is a subsea tieback to the Shell-operated Ursa platform. The Kaikias estimated peak production is 40,000 boe/d, the report stated.
The Stones project began production in 2016 and is the deepest offshore oil and gas producing project in the world (2,896-m [9,500-ft] water depth), according to the company. It is estimated to have a peak annual production of 50,000 boe/d.
Offshore Brazil, Shell operates several producing fields in the Campos Basin: the Bijupirá and Salema fields (80% interest) and the BC10 Field (50% interest). The company’s operations portfolio also includes the Gato do Mato Field in the Santos Basin and the adjacent Sul de Gato do Mato area (80% interest). Additionally, Shell has 10 offshore exploration concessions in the Barreirinhas Basin (Shell’s interest ranges from 50% to 100%) and a presalt production-sharing contract (PSC) for the Shell-operated Alto Cabo Frio Oeste (55% interest).
Offshore Nigeria, Shell’s main deepwater activities are carried out by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co. Ltd. (SNEPCO), which has interests in four deepwater blocks. SNEPCO operates oil mining licenses (OMLs) 118 and 135 and also has a 43.8% nonoperating interest in OML 133 and a 50% nonoperating interest in oil prospecting license 245.
Gumusut-Kakap, with a production capacity of 150,000 boe/d, was Shell’s first deepwater development in Malaysia, which started production in 2014. A Phase 2 development is in the execution phase, with first oil targeted for the third quarter of this year. Malika, which was Malaysia’s first tension-leg platform (TLP) and Shell’s first TLP outside of the GoM, began production in December 2016.
Offshore Mauritania, Shell signed two PSCs with the government for the exploration and potential future production of hydrocarbons in blocks C-10 and C-19 (Shell has 90% interest as operator) in July 2018, according to the report. The blocks are located in the West African Atlantic Margin exploration basin.
Shell also won nine deepwater exploration blocks offshore Mexico last year and will be the operator of all nine blocks.

Talos Energy operates off the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), acquiring, exploiting and exploring the region. The company reported year-end 2018 proved reserves of 151.7 MMboe, of which 76% is proved developed, according to the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial and operational results report. Talos also reported production of 53,400 boe/d, or 4.9 MMboe, in the fourth quarter last year.
In May 2018, Talos Energy LLC and Stone Energy Corp. merged to form a new public company, Talos Energy Inc. The two companies completed a strategic transaction pursuant to which both became wholly owned subsidiaries of the company.
In the report, Talos CEO Timothy Duncan said, “The benefits of the combination have shown results immediately, as we are a stronger, free cash flow positive company with ample liquidity and a significant inventory of drilling locations in both the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Mexico. Our strategy of executing asset management and drilling projects around existing infrastructure in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico complements our high-impact exploration and development projects in offshore Mexico.”
The Helix Producer 1 drydock project was executed in the first quarter of this year by Talos and partner Helix Energy Solutions. Production subsequently restarted at the Phoenix complex in March. In addition, Talos is executing a series of deepwater subsea tieback projects, namely the Mt. Providence, Tornado 3 and Boris 3 wells. Talos expects to bring the Tornado 3 and Boris 3 wells online in April and May of this year, respectively, “which will put Talos in a position to grow production year over year while continuing to generate free cash flow in the current price environment for 2019,” the report stated.
In shallow water, the company’s asset management and drilling activities have allowed assets, such as Ewing Bank 305/306, to achieve production levels not seen in the last 15 years, according to Talos.
In January of this year, Talos acquired the Antrim stranded discovery from Exxon Mobil and entered into partnerships to drill two deepwater projects this year, the Bulleit and Orlov prospects.
On the Zama project, the company’s historic discovery offshore Mexico, Talos confirmed the oil-water contact per its geological model and encountered more sand than expected in the first downdip location, the report stated.
In addition, Talos will start to execute on the inventory it acquired as part of the cross-assignment of interest between Block 2 and Block 31, which includes the low-risk but high-impact Olmeca project on Block 31, according to the report.
Editor's Note:
Talos Energy announced on April 23 that it plans to release its first-quarter 2019 results report on May 8.
Total is the world’s fourth largest energy major and an integrated operator working across the entire oil and gas value chain in more than 130 countries.
In 2018 Total’s production grew more than 8% to a record level of 2,800 boe/d and led to a 71% increase in the company’s E&P net operated income. The year was highlighted by the startup of Ichthys in Australia, Yamal LNG in Russia, deepwater projects Kaombo North in Angola and Egina in Nigeria, as well as the counter-cyclical acquisitions of Maersk Oil and new offshore licenses in the United Arab Emirates.
This year the company has two startups planned in the North Sea, where Total became the second largest operator: Culzean (operator) with 100,000 boe/d and Johan Sverdrup with 440,000 boe/d (expansion to 660,000 boe/d). In addition, an investment decision is expected on the Glendronach discovery. “The [North Sea] region will contribute in a major way to the growth of Total’s production in the coming years,” a press release stated.
Total’s production in sub-Saharan Africa is led by the Gulf of Guinea comprising Angola, Nigeria, Congo and Gabon. The region, where Total operates 11 FPSOs, accounts for 25% of the company’s production.
In 2018 Total delivered positive news on exploration. It first announced a new discovery in the Gulf of Mexico (Ballymore, Chevron-operated). “This major discovery gives us access to large oil resources and follow-on potential in the emerging Norphlet play,” said Arnaud Breuillac, president of Exploration & Production at Total, in a company press release. “We will work together with Chevron on the appraisal of this discovery and a cost-effective scheme to ensure a rapid, low breakeven development.”
Total also successfully appraised the A6 Block (Shwe Yee Htun-2 discovery) offshore Myanmar and later announced two new gas finds in the North Sea (Glendronach and Glengorm in the U.K.).
Earlier this year, Total also discovered a new gas province offshore South Africa with the discovery on the Brulpadda prospect. “With this discovery, Total has opened a new world-class gas and oil play and is well positioned to test several follow-on prospects on the same block,” a company press release stated.
In addition, Total has set a number of objectives to integrate climate into its strategy, which includes reducing 15% greenhouse gas emission (scopes 1 and 2) by 15% on operated oil and gas facilities as well as reducing the intensity of methane emissions of the E&P segment’s operated facilities to less than 0.2% of the commercial gas produced by 2025, the company stated in its 2018 Registration Document released in March 2019.

Title: Myanmar Army committed war crimes against minorities: Report
Yangon, May 29 :The Myanmar military has committed war crimes during its offensive against the Arakan Army following a government order to crush the armed group, a report said on Wednesday.
TheAmnesty Internationalreport said in the last few months Myanmar soldiers have killed and wounded civilians in indiscriminate attacks in Rakhine state, Efe news reported.
It is the same area where the Army in 2017 carried out an offensive against the mostly-Muslim Rohingya minority group, an operation the UN said showed evidence of genocidal intent.
In the report titled "No one can protect us: War crimes and abuses in Myanmar's Rakhine State", the non-profit also denounced atrocities committed by the Arakan Army, such as abductions and intimidation, but accused the Myanmar military of committing human rights violations such as extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances.
"Less than two years since the world outrage over the mass atrocities committed against the Rohingya population, the Myanmar military is again committing horrific abuses against ethnic groups in Rakhine State," Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia, said in a statement.
The report is based on 81 interviews, 54 of which were conducted on the ground in Rakhine, with people of different ethnicities and religions.
The Arakan Army, one of the various rebel groups engaged in armed conflict in Myanmar, was formed in 2009 by students of the Rakhine ethnic group - which is predominantly Buddhist.

Title: MYANMAR Government meets northern rebels, extends truce
Peace talks between the government and the Northern Alliance took place in Muse. The four rebel groups have not yet signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). A four-month truce came into effect on 21 December in Kachin and Shan states. ““The ceasefire period was extended until June 30,” a military spokesperson said. The parties will meet again in the third week of May. Hundreds of thousands of people have become refugees.
Naypyidaw (AsiaNews/Agencies) – There is new hope in Myanmar’speace processafter the country’s Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) extended by two months a unilateral ceasefire in place since last December in five regional commands in Kachin and Shan states.
No truce is in place in Rakhine State where government troops are engaged in a military campaign against theArakan Army(AA), a Buddhist rebel force, and remain on high alert for possible actions by theArakan Rohingya Salvation Army(ARSA), an Islamist insurgent group.
The Office of the Commander-in-Chief announced the extension on the last day of its original four-month truce, which started on 21 December
The decision came hours after peace talks ended for the day between the government and theNorthern Alliancein Muse, northern Shan State, two days ago.
The four-member Northern Alliance includes the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Ta’ang Nationalities Liberation Army (TNLA), Arakan Army (AA) and Kokang’s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA).
Unlike other rebel forces, these groups did not sign theNationwide Ceasefire Agreement(NCA), put forward by the government in 2015.
Military spokesperson Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said that Tuesday’s talks in Muse had been positive. He added that they would help the military achieve their goal of achieving peace by 2020.
“The ceasefire period was extended until June 30. The KIA, TNLA and MNDAA also requested the extension of the ceasefire,” he said.
Major Mai Aik Kyaw from the TNLA said the Northern Alliance members viewed the talks as constructive.
The government delegation, led by the vice president of thePeace Commission, and the representatives of the armed ethnic organisations (EAOs), agree on the need for further talks to reach bilateral ceasefire agreements. The parties will meet again in the third week of May.
Rakhine State was excluded from the truce because of the threat of actions by ARSA. But in recent months, government forces have stepped up actions against the AA as well.
Since 4 January, some 30,000 residents in northern Rakhine State have been displaced by fighting. Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed, but the government puts the figure at 12.
Meanwhile, one of Myanmar’s most serious humanitarian emergencies is unfolding In Kachin. On 9 June 2011, Myanmar’s military and KIA ended a 17-year truce.
Since then,the two sides have clashedabout 3,800 times in the predominantly Christian state in northern Myanmar.
As a result, about 150,000 people have become refugees,130,000 staying in 165 camps for internally displaced persons(IDPs) located in Kachin and northern Shan, and another 20,000 hosted in local communities.
Since 2011, 405 villages have been damaged or destroyed. Some 311 churches, 24 Buddhist monasteries, 34 kindergartens, 122 schools, and 264 clinics have suffered the same fate.

Title: Groups Call for Demilitarization of Areas Near Shan IDP Camps - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar+ 1 more
Shan refugee advocacy groups have called for the demilitarization of areas near six Shan IDP camps housing more than 6,000 people along the Thailand-Myanmar border, especially in southern Shan State.
The groups, the Shan Human Rights Foundation and Shan State Refugee Committee (Thai Border), issued the call in a report launched on Thursday. The report highlighted the security threats the refugees face from both the Myanmar military (or Tatmadaw) and the United Wa State Army in areas of Shan State near the Thai border. It said both sides are taking advantage of ceasefires to deploy forces into contested areas near the border, close to Shan armed groups’ territories.
Therefore, it said, displaced people are not yet able to leave the IDP camps and will need food aid until they can make voluntary, safe and dignified returns to their homes.
Displaced ethnic Shan have been taking shelter at Kong Moong Murng, Loi Tai Laeng, Loi Lam, Koung Jor, Loi Sam Sip and Loi Kaw Wan camps along the border. These camps are near areas controlled by the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS).
“The Myanmar government military deploys troops to the areas near the camps, and so does the UWSA [United Wa State Army], thus leaving less space for the refugees to use the lands for agriculture,” said Sai Yord Luin, the spokesman of the Shan Human Rights Foundation.
“Thus the increase in military troops should be stopped,” he said. “Also we would like to urge the international community to consider support for the refugees,” as they have been trapped in the areas for a couple of decades, he added.
According to the report, international donors made the decision to end support for the Shan refugees in October 2017, as ethnic armed groups in the area signed ceasefires. Outlined in these and the ongoing peace process are steps to facilitate refugee repatriation and development, apparently convincing donors their help was no longer needed.
One-and-a-half years later, according to the report, there “has been no change in donor policy towards the southern Shan IDP/refugee camps, despite worsening security conditions.”
It states, “The reality is entirely different. Ceasefires are tenuous, the peace process has stalled, and armed clashes and human rights violations are continuing. Meanwhile, the two main causes of displacement in southern Shan State remain unaddressed: the Burma Army’s massive scorched earth campaign in 1996-1998, which uprooted over 300,000 people; and the forced resettlement by the United Wa State Army of over 126,000 Wa villagers to southern Shan State in 1999-2001, which pushed out thousands of indigenous inhabitants (under the former Burmese military regime’s divide-and-rule strategy).”
U Sai Leng, the spokesman of the Shan State Refugee Committee (Thai Border), said UWSA troops are pressuring displaced people not to work on lands outside their camps, claiming they are under the armed group’s territorial control.
He added that despite the government’s claim that the refugees can return to their homes because the RCSS signed a ceasefire agreement, the conditions for resettlement are not yet right. The failure of a pilot resettlement project in Mong Hta, in southwest Mongton Township, in 2013 has also made displaced people reconsider leaving their camps.
“The procedures for the refugee resettlement program are still vague,” U Sai Leng said, adding that the peace process should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA).
Three years since the NCA was signed, a majority of Shan, Karen, Karenni and Mon refugees are still stuck in remote IDP and refugee camps along the Thailand-Myanmar border, though hundreds of them chose to go back to their villages via the official resettlement program. As of March, some 20,000 had yet to return and lacked official support, according to The Border Consortium (TBC).
“Some of us are from the Mongton Dam project area. People are worried that there will be no opportunities to make a living there and that their villages will be destroyed by the water from the dam,” said U Sai Leng, who is himself an IDP living in a camp.
The report said the UWSA has also been expanding its southern Shan State territories around the IDP camps. The country’s largest ethnic armed group has self-administrative zones in six townships of Shan State.
In February, according to the report, Wa troops seized hills near Loi Kaw Wan IDP camp in Mong Hsat Township, “in contravention of a boundary agreement with the RCSS/SSA [Shan State Army], depriving IDPs of already scarce agricultural land.”
The displaced people are also concerned over the military reinforcements of “positions around five Shan IDPs camps,” despite an existing ceasefire with the RCSS/SSA. Additionally, the building of a new road and the flying of drones over two of the IDP camps in September last year and January this year have frightened some camp residents.
In February, six 120-mm shells fired by the military at two IDP locations terrified the displaced residents, said U Sai Leng. He said that since then they have been preparing bunkers and carrying out evacuation drills in preparation for further attacks.
He added that these locations are not even on the maps of the UN and INGOs as places in need of humanitarian support.
There are some 162,500 internally displaced persons in southeastern Myanmar, including ethnic Shan in Monghsat, Mongton and Mongpan townships, who are facing protracted displacement, according to a Border Consortium report from November 2018.
The government’s refugee resettlement process is now focusing on the refugee camps. The voluntary return of refugees from Thailand-Myanmar border camps is ongoing and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi and State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi discussed the matter at a meeting in Naypyitaw on Thursday.

No media source currently available
An autonomous ethnic army inside Myanmar with direct connections to China! In Myanmar’s Shan State, the United Wa State Army (UWSA) recently celebrated three decades of peace and autonomy since 1989, when the Communist Party of Burma was ousted and the new leaders formed what is now Myanmar’s largest ethnic faction. With shared culture and business interests with China, the UWSA is seen as an example for smaller ethnic armies also seeking autonomy within Myanmar. Steve Sandford reports for VOA.

Title: MYANMAR Government meets northern rebels, extends truce
Peace talks between the government and the Northern Alliance took place in Muse. The four rebel groups have not yet signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). A four-month truce came into effect on 21 December in Kachin and Shan states. ““The ceasefire period was extended until June 30,” a military spokesperson said. The parties will meet again in the third week of May. Hundreds of thousands of people have become refugees.
Naypyidaw (AsiaNews/Agencies) – There is new hope in Myanmar’speace processafter the country’s Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) extended by two months a unilateral ceasefire in place since last December in five regional commands in Kachin and Shan states.
No truce is in place in Rakhine State where government troops are engaged in a military campaign against theArakan Army(AA), a Buddhist rebel force, and remain on high alert for possible actions by theArakan Rohingya Salvation Army(ARSA), an Islamist insurgent group.
The Office of the Commander-in-Chief announced the extension on the last day of its original four-month truce, which started on 21 December
The decision came hours after peace talks ended for the day between the government and theNorthern Alliancein Muse, northern Shan State, two days ago.
The four-member Northern Alliance includes the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Ta’ang Nationalities Liberation Army (TNLA), Arakan Army (AA) and Kokang’s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA).
Unlike other rebel forces, these groups did not sign theNationwide Ceasefire Agreement(NCA), put forward by the government in 2015.
Military spokesperson Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said that Tuesday’s talks in Muse had been positive. He added that they would help the military achieve their goal of achieving peace by 2020.
“The ceasefire period was extended until June 30. The KIA, TNLA and MNDAA also requested the extension of the ceasefire,” he said.
Major Mai Aik Kyaw from the TNLA said the Northern Alliance members viewed the talks as constructive.
The government delegation, led by the vice president of thePeace Commission, and the representatives of the armed ethnic organisations (EAOs), agree on the need for further talks to reach bilateral ceasefire agreements. The parties will meet again in the third week of May.
Rakhine State was excluded from the truce because of the threat of actions by ARSA. But in recent months, government forces have stepped up actions against the AA as well.
Since 4 January, some 30,000 residents in northern Rakhine State have been displaced by fighting. Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed, but the government puts the figure at 12.
Meanwhile, one of Myanmar’s most serious humanitarian emergencies is unfolding In Kachin. On 9 June 2011, Myanmar’s military and KIA ended a 17-year truce.
Since then,the two sides have clashedabout 3,800 times in the predominantly Christian state in northern Myanmar.
As a result, about 150,000 people have become refugees,130,000 staying in 165 camps for internally displaced persons(IDPs) located in Kachin and northern Shan, and another 20,000 hosted in local communities.
Since 2011, 405 villages have been damaged or destroyed. Some 311 churches, 24 Buddhist monasteries, 34 kindergartens, 122 schools, and 264 clinics have suffered the same fate.
