Title: Myanmar crisis: Caught between army and rebel group, refugees in Mizoram hope for better future but are reluctant to return – Firstpost
Rohingya crisis: Caught between Myanmar Army and rebel group, refugees in Mizoram hope for better future but are reluctant to return
Myanmar refugees in Mizoram who were evicted from their homes late in November are reluctant to return to their villages as they fear escalation of conflict between the Myanmar Army and a rebel outfit called the Arakan Army.
The repatriation, which was planned last week, had to be stalled after large scale opposition from members of the displaced Zhakai community (as identified by locals). They are Buddhist tribals belonging to the Chin community and speak the same language as the Lai in Mizoram who are mainly Christians.
Lawngtlai deputy commissioner Arun T said that village councils have been approached to convince the refugees to return to their villages. An official in Mizoram police said some migrants expressed a willingness to return home after a few weeks, depending on the situation.
Around 1,600 Myanmar refugees have been rehabilitated in Lawngtlai district, about 280 kilometres south of Mizoram’s capital Aizawl, after they crossed the border to the northeastern state on 25 November.
Most of them who did not have relatives across the border were put up in school buildings and community halls in Zochachhuah, Laitlang, Dumzautlang and Hmawngchhuah across the district.
Relief including food and clothes were distributed to refugees by the district administration, Assam Rifles and local organisations such as Young Lai Association (YLA) and Mizoram Thalai Kristian Pawl (MTKP), the youth wing of the Baptist Church of Mizoram.
The crisis erupted at Paletwa after 11 soldiers of the Myanmar Army were reportedly killed on the Kaladan river after being ambushed by the Arakan Army on the border of Myanmar’s Chin and Rakhine State. The fierce encounter that subsequently followed affected several villages and forced inhabitants to flee.
Paletwa is located northeast of the Rohingya heartland in Rakhine State of Myanmar where the military has launched a crackdown following a raid on police outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) with the assistance of local villagers on August 25.
The subversive activities of the Arakan Army and the areas controlled by them is a cause of concern for India since the multi-crore Kaladan Multi Modal Project is being implemented in the region where the rebel group has been increasing its presence. The scheme, which aims at providing an outlet to the landlocked North East, has already suffered delays with some necessary approvals being held up by the Myanmar government. The disturbed conditions in Paletwa and the surrounding region could further retard its progress and all indications point to the resumption of hostilities sooner or later.
Arakan Army is a rebel outfit of local Buddhists founded on 10 April, 2009. It is the armed wing of the United League of Arakan, and led by its commander-in-chief Twan Mrat Naing. It has not yet signed the ceasefire agreement with Tatmadaw (Myanmar’s armed forces) and is part of an alliance of rebel armies called the Northern Alliance.
A report inThe Irrawaddysaid the Arakan Army joined the war against the Tatmadaw in Kokang and Kachin states where the “Arakan Army recruited many members in the jade mining area of Hpakant. Arakanese migrant workers in Mongla near the Chinese border and northern Shan State are also a source of recruitment for the group.”
Sources revealed that the rebels have been strengthening their base in at two locations along the border of Chin and Rakhine State for past two years. The current clashes began in the first week of November after the Tatmadaw moved large columns near the region where the rebel cadres have pitched tent.
“They (Arakan Army) have amassed quite a large quantity of weapons in a short span according to the inputs we have received and their cadre strength has also gone up. This is quite interesting since all these activities cost quite a lot of money,” the source explained. “The possibility of this group’s involvement in the narcotics trade cannot be ruled out,” the source added.

Title: Myanmarese refugees in Mizoram refusing to return home
Unending crisis
Over 1,400 Myanmarese nationals who took refuge in Mizoram's Lawngtlai district following clashes between Arakan militants and the Army in Myanmar in November last year have refused to return to their country, a senior police officer said on Monday.
The refugees who fled Myanmar since November 25 last year following a crackdown on Arakan rebels by the Myanmar Army in the border areas refused to go back, claiming that they were 'afraid' of the Myanmar Army personnel, Superintendent of Police of Lawngtlai, Lalsanglura said.
"Though the fighting between the Myanmar Army and the Arakan insurgents had apparently stopped and no gunfire heard for almost a month, the people who took shelter in four villages along the Mizoram-Myanmar border—Laitlang, Dumzautlang, Zochachhuah and Hmawngbuchhuah—still refused to return to their respective villages," the SP said.
The refugees were mainly from the border villages of Varang, Paletwa, Pakangwa and Mulaw in Myanmar's Chin state.
Lalsanglura said the refugees were grouped in the relief camps in two villages for administrative conveniences and also to ensure that all of them return to their homes after peace is restored in the area from where they came.

Title: No option but to take up arms against Myanmar: Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army - The Siasat Daily – Archive
Rohingya Muslim insurgents said they have no option but to fight Myanmar state-sponsored terrorism to defend the Rohingya community. According to Reuters, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Harkatul Yaqeen) demanded that the Rohingya be consulted on all decisions affecting their future.
In a statement posted on Twitter, ARSA leader stated “ARSA has . . . no other option but to combat ‘Burmese state-sponsored terrorism’ against the Rohingya population for the purpose of defending, salvaging and protecting the Rohingya community.”
Last Friday, the small insurgent group ambushed a Myanmar military truck, wounding several members of the security forces.
It must be recalled that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched raids on the Myanmar security forces on August 25th, sparking sweeping counter-insurgency operations in the Muslim-majority north of Rakhine State that led to widespread violence and arson and an exodus of some 650,000 Rohingya villagers to Bangladesh and other countries.
The United Nations has called the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing.
Rohingya Muslims have for years been denied citizenship and freedom of movement.

Title: Number of clashes decreases in December: Think Tank - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
At least 52 armed incidents took place nationwide in December, down from 63 the previous month, while the conflict in Shan and Kachin intensified, according to the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security (MIPS) in their January briefing.
Although fighting between the Arakan Army/United League of Arakan (AA/ULA) and Tatmadaw in Paletwa ceased, the conflict between Northern Alliance members and the Tatmadaw further escalated. The fighting in Kachin continues to produce high casualties on the Ethnic Armed Organization (EAO) side while the Tatamdaw makes significant advances against its opponents, MIPS said.
Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) continued in December throughout 8 townships in Kachin State with the heaviest fighting seen in Tanai, Waingmaw, Hpakant, and Mansi townships.
The briefing also said the Ta’ang National Liberation Army/ Palaung State Liberation Front (TNLA/PSLF) attacked a number of Tatmadaw outposts throughout the Muse 105-Mile Trade Zone and along the Lashio-Muse road from mid to late December. The TNLA is now coordinating and fighting alongside the KIA, but the Northern Alliance has not succeeded in capturing any of its objectives. More fighting between the two sides will likely continue into the new year.
On December 1, the TNLA took over the Shan State Progressive Party/Shan State Army (SSPP/SSA) controlled Mong Yin village tract in Namtu Township. Then, on December 5, the TNLA clashed with the SSPP/ SSA in Namtu. Both groups are members of the Federal Political Negotiation Consultative Committee (FPNCC). On the following day, the TNLA announced that its takeover of Mong Yin was a matter of cooperation with the SSPP/SSA and an effort to stem drug trafficking and other narcotic related actives. Sources told MIPS that the TNLA’s takeover of the village tract angered SSPP/SSA commanders.
The MIPS also stated that, ethnic tension between the Palaung and Shan is currently on the rise and could prompt more conflict between the two sides in the future. These same ethnic tensions have also strained the TNLA’s relationship with the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA). Under increasing pressure from the Tatmadaw, the TNLA requested a meeting with the RCSS in hopes of improving relations between the two sides, but the meeting has yet to take place
The briefing concludes, the government has strengthened its efforts to reach out to the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) as key players among the northern armed groups that have not signed the NCA. Despite increased coordination between the Tatmadaw and the government, they did not reach consensus on the concept of sub-national dialogue or where consultation meetings should take place. Although it remains uncertain whether the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) will sign the NCA in the near future, it appears that the government and Tatmadaw intend to move forward with negotiations for a political settlement without the remaining 13 non-signatories of the NCA.

Title: War and misery a fact of life for civilians in Myanmar's northeast | Frontier Myanmar

By KYAW LIN HTOON | FRONTIERPhotos THEINT MON SOE AKA J
IN DECEMBER 2016, savage fighting erupted in the Pan Lon village tract in northern Shan State between two ethnic armed groups, forcing hundreds of residents to flee to safety at Lashio, about 48 kilometres (30 miles) to the east.
Among those displaced by the week of clashes between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Shan State Army-South, the armed wing of the Restoration Council of Shan State, was U Yi Lar Tha, 77, and his wife, Daw Swe Mya, 61.
After the fighting subsided, the elderly couple returned to their village. But their hopes of resuming their former lives were shattered in late December of that year, when Yi Lar Tha went with two other farmers to check their land in a nearby field.

Soon after Yi Lar Tha left home, Swe Mya heard an explosion and rushed outside to investigate. She was greeted by her husband’s two friends, bringing the grim news that he had stepped on a landmine, shattering his left leg.
“There was blood everywhere; I could hardly bear to look at him,” recalled Swe Mya. Yi Lar Tha was deafened by the explosion, and after spending nearly a year in hospital, including a stint at a military hospital in Yangon, he returned to his home in northern Shan State where he suffers depression from the incident.
Other victims of the skirmishes between the TNLA and the SSA-S included an 18-year-old woman. Witnesses said she was trying with two other civilians to rescue a disabled boy from a house during a firefight when she was killed by a bullet fired by the TNLA.
Pan Lon is one of many village tracts affected by fighting in northern Shan that has escalated since the peace process was re-launched under the Union Solidarity and Development Party government after it took office in 2011.

The fighting has created anxiety and hardship for thousands of villagers in territory west of the Mandalay-Muse highway and stretching north to the border with China.
Landmines have long been a scourge of conflict areas in Myanmar and they are continuing to wreak havoc in northern Shan.
In its latest annualLandmine Monitorreport released last month, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said at least 8,605 people were killed or injured by the devices throughout the world in 2016, up from 6,967 casualties the previous year.
The report said Afghanistan, Libya, Myanmar, Ukraine and Yemen accounted for 85 percent of the increase in casualties over 2015.
Halo Trust, a Britain-based NGO that focuses on mine-risk education and de-mining in 26 countries, says the threat of death or injury from landmines is higher in northern Shan than anywhere else in Myanmar.
Of the 155 landmine incidents reported throughout the country in 2015 and 2016, half were in Shan, according to Halo Trust data.

In 2017, 56 people were killed in 80 reported landmine blasts in Shan, most of which occurred in the state’s northern conflict areas.
“Although the world has aimed to be free of landmines in 2025, that could not be possible for Myanmar,” said Lway Ai Aww, manager of Halo Trust’s office in Lashio. “Halo started de-mining operations in Cambodia more than two decades ago and the work there is yet to be completed; in our country, we have not yet been able to launch de-mining operations nationwide,” she toldFrontier.
Difficulties accessing conflict areas create challenges for Halo Trust’s mine-risk awareness activities. Villagers are sometimes wary of attending Mine Risk Education events and those who want to attend can face issues, sometimes being scared off by the presence of ethnic armed groups or the Tatmadaw.
In a bid to improve access to restricted areas, in 2016 Halo Trust signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement under which it submits monthly plans so that it can avoid holding meetings in areas where Tatmadaw troops are present.
Lway Ai Aww said MRE, victim assistance and de-mining were Halo Trust’s main responsibilities.
“In Kayin State, as a result of signing the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement [by the Karen National Union and seven other ethnic armed groups in 2015], we can begin surveying to draw the landmine maps that are the foundation task of de-mining,” she said.
The situation in northern Shan is complicated by the number of ethnic armed groups operating in the area, of which three – the TNLA, the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army – have all come under pressure from the Tatmadaw over their refusal to sign the NCA.
The situation has also been affected by some unexpected developments. Tensions are reported to have eased between the TNLA and the SSA-S, an NCA signatory that had been able to redeploy troops from eastern Shan to the state’s north soon after signing the ceasefire. There are reports that relations between the SSA-S and the Tatmadaw have become strained over the stalled peace process.
“The Tatmadaw is fiercely opposed to groups such as the TNLA, MNDAA and AA participating in the peace process. However, these groups are among the most active in northern Shan and that is the reason for the continuing unrest there,” said political analyst U Than Soe Naing.
In a dramatic move, the so-called Northern Alliance of the KIA, TNLA, MNDAA and AA in November 2016 launched a series of surprise attacks on security posts in northern Shan that temporary shut the main land trade route to China.
The years of fighting in northern Shan have left thousands of people languishing in camps for the displaced. Figures released by the United Nations Office for Coordinating Humanitarian Affairs in October showed that there were 9,408 IDPs in camps in northern Shan, and another 89,267 in neighbouring Kachin State.
Pan Tha Pyay village, about 16km from Namtu, has hosted an IDP camp for more than two years. The camp’s 90 residents include 20 children born there since it opened.
U Ai La, 34, a Palaung, is the father of twins born in the camp. He farmed corn at his village in Mongton Township before fighting forced him to flee.
“I will never go back to my village while the fighting continues,” Ai La toldFrontier,adding that he would continue to work and survive as an IDP camp resident.
The IDPs say they have received assistance from donor groups but government officials have never visited the camp.
U Thi La, a monk at a monastery near the camp complained about a shortage of water.
“We are forced to draw water for washing from ponds that have been contaminated by buffalos and causes skin complaints,” he said, adding that they get their drinking water from a nearby stream but that the supply is inconsistent.
Northern Shan remains a major opium growing area, and U San Lwin, chairman of Namtu Township Development Committee, acknowledges efforts by the TNLA to combat drug abuse and poppy cultivation, but said that its focus on rural areas has led to many users and dealers moving to the town.
“As they are clearing the remote villages, the dealers and users have moved into the township where the rule of law remains a fairy tale,” he said.
San Lwin said he had been proud of the township because it had fewer addicts than other communities and its young people had wholesome pursuits, including playing sport.
“Now, you can see drug users everywhere; and the drugs are easy to buy,” he said.

Sai Myo, 24, who was born into a poor family at a village near Namtu, said he began using opium when he was 16. Within three years he was addicted.
To support his habit and ensure constant supply, Sai Myo has become a part-time dealer.
In 2017, Sai Myo sought help for his addiction at a clinic in Namtu run by the Substance Abuse Research Association, a domestic NGO, and was placed on methadone substitution therapy, but he has since relapsed.
It’s common knowledge in Namtu that dealers and users gather either at a location known as Thae Kwin (the “sand field”) or beside the cemetery.
At Kyu Sot village between Namtu and Bawdwin is a camp that has been sheltering 271 IDPs from seven villages in Mongton Township since July 2016. In Namtu Township there are four IDP camps, including one in Lisu village housing 123 people and another run by the Kachin Baptist Convention that has 164 residents.
Rebuilding the lives of IDPs and tackling narcotics abuse will be just two of the challenges facing the troubled region when peace finally comes.
In a report released on December 1, UNOCHA said a total of about 15,000 people had been displaced by conflict in northern Shan since 2011 and were living in camps or camp-like settings. About 78 percent of the IDPs in northern Shan are women and children.
Displacement in Shan is often temporary, with many of the displaced returning home after fairly short periods, said the report, UNOCHA’s2018 Interim Humanitarian Response Plan for Myanmar.
It noted that attacks early last March by the MNDAA at Laukkai in the Kokang Self-Administered Zone had temporarily displaced an estimated 30,000 people. Fighting last May between the Tatmadaw and TNLA in northern Shan had caused further displacement, as has clashes the same month in Namtu, Kyaukme and Mawkmai townships.

Lway Ai Aww said landmines pose one of the biggest threats to rebuilding the lives of those who have been displaced or otherwise affected by conflict.
“A person armed with a weapon may consider with his own heart, but a landmine has no mercy if you are a child or an elder,” she said.
There has also been a surge in fighting between the Tatmadaw and KIA in Kachin State in recent weeks.
A difference between MPs from conflict areas and those from townships blessed by peace can be a determination to forcefully raise issues affecting constituents. One such MP in northern Shan is Nang Kham Aye, who represents Namtu in the Pyithu Hluttaw for the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy.
Kham Aye claims her forthright style has offended some high-ranking officers in the Tatmadaw and Myanmar Police Force.
“They don’t like me and some leaders of the CSSU also may not like me because I always put my constituents’ interests first,” she said, referring to the Committee for Shan State Unity.
The committee was formed in 2013 with representatives from Shan ethnic armed groups, the SNLD, Shan Nationalities Democratic Party, and other state-based political parties and civil society groups to hold community consultations for the national-level political dialogues taking place as part of the peace process.
However, an attempt to hold one of the events at Panglong in southern Shan on December 17 was blocked by the arrival of about 60 Tatmadaw troops. Kham Aye says she plans to raise the incident in the hluttaw.
The national-level political dialogues are a mandatory step under the NCA. They enable stakeholders to propose suggestions and recommendations at public meetings, which are then shared by delegates at the 21st Century Panglong Union Peace Conferences.
According to the NCA, there are three types of NDs, focusing on the economy, social issues or land and the environment. NDs have so far been held in the areas of the eight NCA signatories, except for Shan and Rakhine states.
Kham Aye despairs at the lack of progress in the peace process, as well as the plight of IDPs in northern Shan.
“The peace process is deadlocked and going nowhere, and the government does not seem to care for the IDPs,” she toldFrontierin an interview at her Namtu home in late November.
“On behalf of the IDPs I want to express my sadness that successive governments have never apologised to them for their suffering,” she said.

The ongoing crisis in Rakhine State, where the Myanmar armed forces have credibly been accused of ethnic cleansing and where the Myanmar militaryrecently admittedthat the security forces were involved in a massacre that left a group of Rohingya dumped in a mass grave, shows no signs of resolution. It is extremely unlikely that many Rohingya will voluntarily return to Myanmar, where they are disenfranchised, have few civil rights, and face a situation in Rakhine State in which many of their towns have been torched. Taking advantage of potential Rohingya anger, a Rohingya militant group continues to launch attacks into Myanmar, making the situation along the border and in Rakhine State even more tenuous. The latest attacks, which came in early January, suggest the Rohingya militants are active and may been gaining skills.The situation in Rakhine State—and in the camps in Bangladesh—is the worst humanitarian crisis in East Asia. But at the same time, Myanmar actually confronts multiple other ticking time bombs. These demonstrate that Naypyidaw’s military/civilian government is failing not only in western Myanmar but also in other parts of the country.In Kachin State in the north, for instance, anexcellent new articlefromIRIN Newsdetails how that area’s long-running conflict has gotten worse this dry season, while Aung San Suu Kyi’s peace negotiations with ethnic minority groups have produced no concrete results in the Kachin State battle. In fact, the military appears to be waging a tougher fight in Kachin State now than it had several years ago. AsIRIN News reports, more than one hundred thousand people have been displaced in Kachin State and northern Shan State, and aid organizations have little access to many of these suffering people. AsIRIN Newsnotes:
Rights groups say government restrictions have squeezed humanitarian access to a trickle, leaving tens of thousands of displaced people [in Kachin and Shan States] without aid, caught in the crosshairs between the military and rebel groups.
In Shan State, violence is picking up again too, further suggesting a failure in Suu Kyi’s peace plans. In fact, as Anthony Davisnotes inAsia Times, the dry season violence in Shan State, in which insurgent groups are getting bolder and the most powerful insurgency remains unchecked, could kill Suu Kyi’s peace plan completely. He writes that “this year could finally derail a government sponsored peace process that has already been stalled for months.” As Davis notes, small insurgent groups like the Paluang have in recent years gained recruits and become more aggressive, and the number of groups fighting in parts of Shan State has expanded. The spread of more armed groups into Shan State makes it highly likely that some of these armies could battle each other this dry season—and that the Myanmar military will initiate a large-scale offensive in Shan State as well.Meanwhile, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), a heavily armed insurgent group with over twenty thousand fighters (and historically linked to narcotrafficking), roams free in portions of Shan State it controls. The UWSA has mostly disdained the government’s peace efforts, and has increasingly supported and armed other insurgent groups operating in Myanmar’s northeast. Its support has helped make the other ethnic armies even more powerful.Suu Kyi’s government seems to have no plan for how to deal with the UWSA in the long-term; the insurgent group has for decades essentially run its own independent statelet in Myanmar’s northeast. The government has little to offer the UWSA to disarm and accept central power, and Myanmar’s military is loath to take on the UWSA directly.Rakhine State is certainly a catastrophe. But in other parts of Myanmar, the government and military face severe challenges as well—and ones that they do not seem to have answers for.

Title: War and misery a fact of life for civilians in Myanmar's northeast | Frontier Myanmar

By KYAW LIN HTOON | FRONTIERPhotos THEINT MON SOE AKA J
IN DECEMBER 2016, savage fighting erupted in the Pan Lon village tract in northern Shan State between two ethnic armed groups, forcing hundreds of residents to flee to safety at Lashio, about 48 kilometres (30 miles) to the east.
Among those displaced by the week of clashes between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Shan State Army-South, the armed wing of the Restoration Council of Shan State, was U Yi Lar Tha, 77, and his wife, Daw Swe Mya, 61.
After the fighting subsided, the elderly couple returned to their village. But their hopes of resuming their former lives were shattered in late December of that year, when Yi Lar Tha went with two other farmers to check their land in a nearby field.

Soon after Yi Lar Tha left home, Swe Mya heard an explosion and rushed outside to investigate. She was greeted by her husband’s two friends, bringing the grim news that he had stepped on a landmine, shattering his left leg.
“There was blood everywhere; I could hardly bear to look at him,” recalled Swe Mya. Yi Lar Tha was deafened by the explosion, and after spending nearly a year in hospital, including a stint at a military hospital in Yangon, he returned to his home in northern Shan State where he suffers depression from the incident.
Other victims of the skirmishes between the TNLA and the SSA-S included an 18-year-old woman. Witnesses said she was trying with two other civilians to rescue a disabled boy from a house during a firefight when she was killed by a bullet fired by the TNLA.
Pan Lon is one of many village tracts affected by fighting in northern Shan that has escalated since the peace process was re-launched under the Union Solidarity and Development Party government after it took office in 2011.

The fighting has created anxiety and hardship for thousands of villagers in territory west of the Mandalay-Muse highway and stretching north to the border with China.
Landmines have long been a scourge of conflict areas in Myanmar and they are continuing to wreak havoc in northern Shan.
In its latest annualLandmine Monitorreport released last month, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said at least 8,605 people were killed or injured by the devices throughout the world in 2016, up from 6,967 casualties the previous year.
The report said Afghanistan, Libya, Myanmar, Ukraine and Yemen accounted for 85 percent of the increase in casualties over 2015.
Halo Trust, a Britain-based NGO that focuses on mine-risk education and de-mining in 26 countries, says the threat of death or injury from landmines is higher in northern Shan than anywhere else in Myanmar.
Of the 155 landmine incidents reported throughout the country in 2015 and 2016, half were in Shan, according to Halo Trust data.

In 2017, 56 people were killed in 80 reported landmine blasts in Shan, most of which occurred in the state’s northern conflict areas.
“Although the world has aimed to be free of landmines in 2025, that could not be possible for Myanmar,” said Lway Ai Aww, manager of Halo Trust’s office in Lashio. “Halo started de-mining operations in Cambodia more than two decades ago and the work there is yet to be completed; in our country, we have not yet been able to launch de-mining operations nationwide,” she toldFrontier.
Difficulties accessing conflict areas create challenges for Halo Trust’s mine-risk awareness activities. Villagers are sometimes wary of attending Mine Risk Education events and those who want to attend can face issues, sometimes being scared off by the presence of ethnic armed groups or the Tatmadaw.
In a bid to improve access to restricted areas, in 2016 Halo Trust signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement under which it submits monthly plans so that it can avoid holding meetings in areas where Tatmadaw troops are present.
Lway Ai Aww said MRE, victim assistance and de-mining were Halo Trust’s main responsibilities.
“In Kayin State, as a result of signing the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement [by the Karen National Union and seven other ethnic armed groups in 2015], we can begin surveying to draw the landmine maps that are the foundation task of de-mining,” she said.
The situation in northern Shan is complicated by the number of ethnic armed groups operating in the area, of which three – the TNLA, the ethnic Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army – have all come under pressure from the Tatmadaw over their refusal to sign the NCA.
The situation has also been affected by some unexpected developments. Tensions are reported to have eased between the TNLA and the SSA-S, an NCA signatory that had been able to redeploy troops from eastern Shan to the state’s north soon after signing the ceasefire. There are reports that relations between the SSA-S and the Tatmadaw have become strained over the stalled peace process.
“The Tatmadaw is fiercely opposed to groups such as the TNLA, MNDAA and AA participating in the peace process. However, these groups are among the most active in northern Shan and that is the reason for the continuing unrest there,” said political analyst U Than Soe Naing.
In a dramatic move, the so-called Northern Alliance of the KIA, TNLA, MNDAA and AA in November 2016 launched a series of surprise attacks on security posts in northern Shan that temporary shut the main land trade route to China.
The years of fighting in northern Shan have left thousands of people languishing in camps for the displaced. Figures released by the United Nations Office for Coordinating Humanitarian Affairs in October showed that there were 9,408 IDPs in camps in northern Shan, and another 89,267 in neighbouring Kachin State.
Pan Tha Pyay village, about 16km from Namtu, has hosted an IDP camp for more than two years. The camp’s 90 residents include 20 children born there since it opened.
U Ai La, 34, a Palaung, is the father of twins born in the camp. He farmed corn at his village in Mongton Township before fighting forced him to flee.
“I will never go back to my village while the fighting continues,” Ai La toldFrontier,adding that he would continue to work and survive as an IDP camp resident.
The IDPs say they have received assistance from donor groups but government officials have never visited the camp.
U Thi La, a monk at a monastery near the camp complained about a shortage of water.
“We are forced to draw water for washing from ponds that have been contaminated by buffalos and causes skin complaints,” he said, adding that they get their drinking water from a nearby stream but that the supply is inconsistent.
Northern Shan remains a major opium growing area, and U San Lwin, chairman of Namtu Township Development Committee, acknowledges efforts by the TNLA to combat drug abuse and poppy cultivation, but said that its focus on rural areas has led to many users and dealers moving to the town.
“As they are clearing the remote villages, the dealers and users have moved into the township where the rule of law remains a fairy tale,” he said.
San Lwin said he had been proud of the township because it had fewer addicts than other communities and its young people had wholesome pursuits, including playing sport.
“Now, you can see drug users everywhere; and the drugs are easy to buy,” he said.

Sai Myo, 24, who was born into a poor family at a village near Namtu, said he began using opium when he was 16. Within three years he was addicted.
To support his habit and ensure constant supply, Sai Myo has become a part-time dealer.
In 2017, Sai Myo sought help for his addiction at a clinic in Namtu run by the Substance Abuse Research Association, a domestic NGO, and was placed on methadone substitution therapy, but he has since relapsed.
It’s common knowledge in Namtu that dealers and users gather either at a location known as Thae Kwin (the “sand field”) or beside the cemetery.
At Kyu Sot village between Namtu and Bawdwin is a camp that has been sheltering 271 IDPs from seven villages in Mongton Township since July 2016. In Namtu Township there are four IDP camps, including one in Lisu village housing 123 people and another run by the Kachin Baptist Convention that has 164 residents.
Rebuilding the lives of IDPs and tackling narcotics abuse will be just two of the challenges facing the troubled region when peace finally comes.
In a report released on December 1, UNOCHA said a total of about 15,000 people had been displaced by conflict in northern Shan since 2011 and were living in camps or camp-like settings. About 78 percent of the IDPs in northern Shan are women and children.

Title: Myanmar’s Unhappy Rebels – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
Dissatisfaction with the government’s approach to peace talks could lead to renewed conflict in Myanmar’s north.
In this November 30, 2016 photo, three Kachin Independence Army (KIA) soldiers patrol along the bunker at the front line of on a mountain near Laiza, the headquarters of KIA in Kachin State. Myanmar.
With thelatestUnion Peace Conference (which is held every six months as part of Myanmar’s peace process) coming in late January, Myanmar’s government faces the serious problem that the event would be vulnerable to an offensive by those ethnic armed groups who reject the government’scontroversialNational Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) as the basis for a viable national peace agreement.
Resolving Myanmar’s protracted civil wars with its ethnic minorities, which have raged since independence in 1948, is the country’s defining challenge in the 21st century. But reconciling the demands of a dizzying range of ethnic armies with the centralizing vision of the powerful Myanmar armed forces (known as the Tatmadaw) has proven challenging, although a number of non-signatories to the NCA did attend thepreviouspeace conference in the summer of 2017. This coalition of dissident groups came to the last Union Peace Conference (UPC) after Chinese pressure to attend, though China also supports an unofficial alternative peace process proposed by the newlyformedFederal Political Negotiating and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) — a northern alliance of Chinese-backed rebels — as well.
Unfortunately the official peace process has remained stalled since the last UPC, and a slide toward renewed civil war is feared, as frustration on the ground at the lack of real change since the election of Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian National League for Democracy (NLD) government becomes harder to ignore. Under fire for her perceived indifference toward the Tatmadaw’s brutal ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar’s northwest, Suu Kyi has even been forced toembracethe influence of China, the same power that supported the military junta that kept her under house arrest for 15 years. Thus a weakened civilian federal government is perceived by the rebels as unable to speak for the Tatmadaw or its commander-in-chief, senior general Min Aung Hlaing. Meanwhile China keeps a foot in both camps so as to protect itsinvestmentsin Myanmar,openlyselling arms to the Tatmadaw and keeping up close ties diplomatically (Beijing has protected Myanmar against at the UN over the Rohingya issue, for example).
Such uncertainty makes Myanmar’s security situation volatile, particularly in the country’s northeastern Shan state, where a coalition of dissident groups are jockeying with the Tatmadaw and each other for position, and instrife-tornnorthern Kachin state, where the conflict was renewed between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in 2011. In Kachin state, the KIA rebels say they are anticipating a winter offensive by the Tatmadaw and complain bitterly about the double standards shown by the international community toward their conflict and the Rohingya issue in Rakhine state. But the situation in Shan state is perhaps more critical, since there are many more armed factions there, including the KIA, and events are conspiring to undermine the semblance of control exercised by the Tatmadaw in the region. A major security incident in Shan state would guarantee military retaliation and probably see the end of any participation in the UPC by dissident rebel groups outside of the NCA as a result.
Tatmadaw rule in Shan state (particularly the north) operates as a garrison state whose control outside of the main towns and cities rests heavily on a combination of controlling the area’s few major highways, divide-and-rule tactics, plus a patchwork of colonial style “native” garrisons in the rural hinterlands’ few township centers usingdubiouslocal people’s militia forces (PMFs). The PMFs are basically paramilitary collaborators with the Tatmadaw, whose major activities include drug trafficking and illegal gambling. Unsurprisingly they are also frequently accused of major human rights abuses, including forced recruitment, and appear locally as the untrustworthy face of the authoritarian Myanmar state.
The Tatmadaw sees the NCA as a defining legal step toward disarming rebel groups (a view not shared by rebel armies themselves) and has been exerting pressure on non-signatories to join a ceasefire, which is rejected by many groups in Shan state as an unsatisfactory starting point for serious negotiations.
Inside Shan state, the Tatmadaw is also widely seen as having failed to live up to its own commitments under the NCA, whilst hypocritically seeking to enforce its terms on the rebels. Thus a brittle but brutal local power structure is being asked to tolerate considerable stress and political ambiguity, while at a national level talks have stalled even between the NCA signatories and the NLD civilian government. Moreover some NCA signatories have publicly aligned themselves with prominent dissident armies like the China-backed United Wa State Army (UWSA). The UWSA itself is thelinchpina powerful bloc of different armed ethnic armies in Shan state that together reject the NCA and only attended the most recent UPC under Chinese pressure. Though the situation is ever-fluid and different ethnic rebel groups have fought one another in past, at present the UWSA has built up other dissident rebel factions with weaponry, training, logistical backing, and occasionally manpower. The FPNCC demands that the government of Myanmar recognize this umbrella group of northern rebels as single, united bloc in peace negotiations.
The Tatmadaw appears to hope that China can be persuaded to exert its influence over the UWSA and its ethnic allies to join the NCA, and then attend the upcoming January UPC as more than mere observers. If not, it will probably fall back on the tried and trusted method of trying to pressure the rebels into compliance with artillery strikes and low level skirmishing. The danger is that the rebel alliance will take the opportunity to respond by launching a coordinated counter-offensive to repel the Tatmadaw, ashappenedin November 2016. This would embarrass the Tatmadaw just as the Union Peace Conference scheduled for late January begins with a celebration of the NCA, and would probably deal this round of talks a deathblow — not to mention the idea of the NCA as a still-viable basis for national peace negotiations. In short, there is a real possibility that Myanmar’s unhappy rebels could cause the collapse of the NLD’s signature policy for peace in 2018, with untold effects on the authority of the federal civilian government.
Sadly, the formation of a new civilian-led government in Myanmar has not led to permanent improvements in the general human rights situation there, in part because the junta that controlled Myanmar beforehand rammed through a constitution to hamstring the independence of any future NLD government. This is essentially what has happened since 2015, and the Tatmadaw retains significant political power independent of any civilian oversight, and control of key security ministries (and with an allocated 25 percent of seats in Myanmar’s parliament, it also has a formal veto over constitutional changes that might challenge this state of affairs). A collapse of the peace process would therefore damage the Tatmadaw’s chief civilian opponents in Naypyidaw, but the armed forces might conceivably emerge strengthened from any crisis, at least in the short term.
For this reason, it is to be hoped that the upcoming UPC is not boycotted by factions associated by the FPNCC. The NLD must also take more steps to move away from the NCA as the sole basis of negotiations, however; that ceasefire was a policy of the previous military-backed administration and is irrevocably tainted by its association with the armed forces in the minds of Myanmar’s ethnic minorities. The NLD should take this opportunity to open the agenda of the upcoming conference up to listen to the objections of the dissidents who have remained outside of the NCA (provided the northern rebels themselves all observe a unilateral ceasefire for the peace talks until an agreed upon deadline — and this should include the KIA). In this way the NLD can put a clear political space between itself and the Tatmadaw and renew faith in the administration of Suu Kyi as one that is open to hearing the grievances of all of Myanmar’s many peoples, not just the Burman majority that has dominated the country for so long since independence from Britain.

Title:  Bangkok Post - State keen to retain border trade growth
January mission  to target Shan State
PUBLISHED : 11 Jan 2018 at 09:42
NEWSPAPER SECTION:Business
WRITER:Phusadee Arunmas
Thailand's border trade is expected to grow 10-14% this year from an estimated 1.6 trillion baht in 2017, driven by growing demand for Thai goods, underlining the importance of partnerships on trade and investment as well as working to improve trade with minor cities in neighbouring countries.
Adul Chotinisakorn, deputy director–general of the Foreign Trade Department, said Thailand's Young Entrepreneur Network Development Programme (YEN-D) is instrumental to border trade growth.
Launched in 2015 to encourage Thai entrepreneurs to invest abroad and gain knowledge of the regional market as well as the trade and investment regulations of Thailand's neighbours, the YEN-D programme features familiarisation trips and special training courses for young businesspeople in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand to help them better understand each other's cultures and regulations.
To be selected, Thai entrepreneurs have to be under 45 and come from business families. Governments in other participating countries have similar criteria.
Mr Adul said Thailand's border trade value was estimated at 1.6 trillion baht for 2017, up 12.7% from 1.42 trillion in 2016. Malaysia controlled the largest market share of about 50%, followed by Myanmar with 20%, Laos 20% and Cambodia 10%.
Thailand's border trade has grown between 10-14% a year over the last five years.
The Commerce Ministry, which will hold a border trade committee meeting this month to discuss the 2018 target, is bullish that growth will continue in the same range as the last five years.
In a related development, the Foreign Trade Department will lead a trade mission later this month to Nay Pyi Taw to discuss with Myanmar authorities about possible investment collaboration in Shan State, the biggest state in that country.
Mr Adul said Shan State strongly demands Thai investment in electricity, hotels, restaurants, agro-industry and tourism–related businesses. Late last year, the department led a trade mission to Shan State with several large Thai companies including the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), Bangkok Mass Transit System Plc, the Port Authority of Thailand and Amata Corporation Plc.
He said Shan State is in dire need of electricity development and PEA is keen to expand its investment there.

Title: Myanmar: Army Seizes Rebel Camps, Kills Insurgents In Kachin State – Eurasia Review
A Journal of Analysis and News

Location of Myanmar (Burma). Source: CIA World Factbook.
ByRFA
In an attack using heavy weapons, the Myanmar military on Thursday captured several hillside camps operated by an ethnic armed group and killed an unspecified number of enemy soldiers during hostilities in the country’s northernmost Kachin state.
The army said it killed “some” Kachin Independence Army (KIA) soldiers in the attack and seized arms and ammunition, according to a Facebook post on Friday by the office of Myanmar’s commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.
The government army seized 22 outposts, four main camps, and 18 small camps belonging to the KIA between Nov. 13, 2017, and Jan. 3, and cut off a popular route that it says the rebel group had been using to smuggle timber to China.
Government soldiers conducting the military operation, which began about 25 miles southwest of the town of Namkham, found and seized camps where the KIA was engaging in smuggling natural resources, including timber, to China, the army said.
The Myanmar army confiscated buildings, vouchers used in the collection of ‘extorted money,’ and small arms and ammunition at the scene, it said.
“A main route which passes illegally through Momeik and Mabein townships and is used to smuggle Myanmar’s precious natural resources and timber to [China] could be closed and placed under [Myanmar army] control,” the Facebook post said.
“The Tatmadaw [Myanmar military] columns are in hot pursuit of fleeing terrorist insurgents and continue to expose main points [of activity], including other illegal routes,” it said.
KIA soldiers from Mangan village in Manweingyi village-tract attempted to shoot down a helicopter used by government forces for administrative affairs on Nov. 27, damaging it slightly, the Facebook post said.
Colonel Naw Bu, spokesman of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), the KIA’s political wing, downplayed the Myanmar military’s account of the attacks.
“We don’t have that many camps in this area,” he told RFA’s Myanmar Service. “They [the Myanmar army] got some small posts not by fighting, but because we left them.”
Naw Bu also denied the KIA’s involvement in smuggling timber to China
“The army has talked about how the KIA is smuggling timber to other countries, and it is just to damage the KIA’s image,” he said. “We don’t have any forests in Kachin state. The timber they spoke of is coming from Mandalay and Sagaing region.”
“As far as we know, businessmen, forest officials, and [Myanmar] military officials are engaged in this business, he said, adding that the government army has not tried to stop timber smuggling in the other two areas where businessmen cut down trees, though they do so in Kachin state.
Naw Bu also siad that the fighting between the KIA and government military would not end any time soon.
“Because the government army has been conducting offensive attacks, there will be more fighting as long as it doesn’t retreat.”
The KIA, which controls large swathes of northeastern Kachin state, has regularly engaged in clashes with the Myanmar army since a bilateral 17-year cease-fire agreement collapsed in 2011, forcing about 100,000 residents to flee to safety over the years.
Its territory includes Tanaing township’s gold and amber mining region, on whose natural resources it depends as a source of income through the levying of a five-percent tax on mine operators.
Some of the KIA’s most recent hostilities with the Myanmar military have occurred in Tanaing and in neighboring northern Shan state.
The KIA is one of several militias with which the Myanmar government is trying to end decades of ethnic separatist civil wars and forge peace in the country through a series of peace negotiations launched in August 2016 by de facto national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Earlier this week, the KIO reshuffled its top leadership, replacing departing officers with a younger generation of leaders as hostilities between the group’s armed wing and government forces continued to flare up.

Title: Rohingya insurgents ambush Myanmar military truck, five wounded - Saudi Gazette
YANGON— Rohingya Muslim insurgents ambushed a military vehicle in Myanmar's Rakhine State, wounding five members of the security forces, state media and officials said, and the rebels claimed responsibility for the rare attack.A wave of raids by the insurgents on security force posts on Aug. 25 sparked sweeping army counter-insurgency operations in the Muslim-majority north of the state that led to widespread violence and arson and an exodus of some 650,000 Rohingya villagers to neighboring Bangladesh.The United Nations condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejected that. But since Aug. 25, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgents, who claimed responsibility for the coordinated raids on 30 security posts, have mounted only a few sporadic attacks.The military said "extremist Bengali terrorists ARSA" carried out the Friday attack on a truck taking someone to hospital. "A vehicle ... was attacked by 20 insurgents from the mountain using homemade mines and small arms," the government said. The military said there were about 10 attackers.An ARSA spokesman said his group had carried out the attack. "Yes, ARSA takes responsibility for the latest military movement," the spokesman told Reuters through a messaging service. He said further details may be revealed later.The ARSA dismisses any links to militant groups and says it is fighting to end the oppression of the Rohingya people.The Yangon-based Frontier Myanmar magazine quoted a resident of a nearby village as saying sporadic gunfire had been heard at the time of the ambush. A state-run newspaper reported on Saturday that fighting continued after the ambush. The area is largely off-limits to reporters.Myanmar and Bangladesh have been discussing a plan to repatriate the Rohingya refugees but more insecurity in Myanmar is likely to raise doubts about how quickly that might take place.On Friday, Myanmar's military has used heavy weapons to overrun remote rebel camps in northern Kachin state, the army as a seasonal offensive ramps up the long-running conflict.But the conflict in Kachin, a mainly Christian state in the Buddhist-majority country, has rumbled on away from international headlines and fighting is again intensifying now that monsoon rains have ended.The army — or Tatmadaw — said it had gained the upper hand after seizing 22 camps of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) since mid-November and blocking off a key timber smuggling route to China.Heavy weapons were used Thursday to attack hillside camps as the army killed "some enemies" and seized arms and ammunition, according to a statement posted on Facebook by the office of commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing."Tatmadaw columns are in hot pursuit of fleeing terrorist insurgents," the statement added. The rebels and the army trade allegations of abuses, while observers accuse both sides of trafficking timber, jade and drugs to fund the fighting.After a 17-year ceasefire, the KIA restarted its fight for autonomy in 2011 resulting in unrest that has killed hundreds and displaced more than 100,000 people.The KIA confirmed the renewed hostilities were "very serious" and that the military was using airstrikes and heavy artillery against its positions. "Our ethnic groups didn't launch the offensive. It was the military. We are only fighting back," KIA spokesman Lt. Col. Naw Buu said, also denying rebel involvement in the illegal timber trade. — Agencies< Previous PageNext Page >
