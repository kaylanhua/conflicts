Crimson, scarlet, burgundy, vermillion. Flags, rags, scarves and sarongs. From the western shores of Savai’i to the eastern beaches of Upolu, the towns and villages of the Pacific islands of Samoa are peppered with splashes of red.
This is Thursday, December 5, 2019: the first of two days of a country-wide “lockdown” when, in a bid to quell a devastating measles outbreak, the government of this tiny Polynesian nation has resorted to banning all but essential movement on the islands.
By that day, three weeks since the government first declared a state of emergency, more than 4,000 confirmed or suspected cases of the disease were logged: a figure that’s since risen by nearly 1,400. All but emergency road traffic is banned.
Schools, shops, and businesses are shuttered. Children are forbidden from public spaces. And the entire population of 200,000 has been ordered to stay home and to hang out red fabrics if they want a mobile vaccination team to call.
“It’s the only cure we have to get immunised,” says mother-of two Maria Hastings, 37, when we pull in behind a white Toyota Hillix, carrying a nurse giving shots in front yards.

In fact, the nurse is this year’s Miss Pacific Islands, Fonoifafo McFarland-Seumanu.TheTelegraphis trailing her convoy, down lanes of green bromeliads, orange-and-yellow crotons, and flowering hibiscus hedges.
Like more than 100 such teams, fanning out across the islands for the globally unprecedented two-day action, her vehicle stops wherever a red cloth is spotted: tied to steel gates, nailed to breadfruit trees, and staked into chicken-cropped lawns.
Ms McFarland-Seamanu stays close to the nation’s capital, Apia, on the northern coast of Upolu. This morning she works a grid of middle class streets in the village of Vaitale, 10 minutes south west, where the density of population gives the exquisitely infectious virus an edge compared with rural locations.
“I need the protection, not for me, but for the family,” says Laine Alatise, 49, when we halt where a knotted red sarong wraps the trunk of an electricity pole. “We have six little ones under the age of five.”
The islanders can no longer afford the luxury of doubt. They’ve witnessed what measles can do. While Europe, North America, Australasia and other regions have seen growing misinformation over the benefits of immunisation, Samoa has had enough of such talk.

At Apia’s central medical centre, the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital (TTM), on Ififi Street, children of the age of Alatise’s little ones have been dying, day after day after day. Between September 30, when tests confirmed the first four measles cases, and the two-day shutdown, the government’s national operations centre attributed 62 deaths to measles.
Fifty-four were children younger than five. And by the time I file this report, the toll had grown to 77 reported dead, of whom the vast majority were babies and young infants – among a population about the size of Peterborough, England.
“Most of the kids have severe pneumonia, often complicated by multi-resistant bacterial infections,” explains Stephen Owens, an infectious disease paediatrician working with an 18-strong emergency medical squad who flew in from the UK last month.
He’s part of a small army of overseas national disaster teams and international aid workers who have descended on this cluster of volcanic outcrops, four hours by air north east of New Zealand, and about 30 to 35 from London.
“Any one of the children I saw yesterday would have been a child being cared for in a high dependency unit at home, or even intensive care,” he says, comparing facilities at TTM with what he normally has access to in his work. “But here that’s not possible. There are not enough beds to provide that level of care for every child.”

Government data is dry. Statistics. Ages. But we saw what they mean to families. Days before the lockdown, we met two sisters-in-law who both lost sons, aged 14 months and six months, who died just two days apart.
“I saw him every day on the life support machine, and I saw him deteriorating,” says Selema Samuelu, 23, the mother of the older boy. “It’s very hard to accept, and to see my child suffer like that.”
Samoa’s grief is as tangible as the current wet season’s rain. In another home we visit, the Tuivales mourn the deaths of three children who died, days apart: a three-year-old daughter, Italia, a 17-month-old girl, Tamar, and Tamar’s twin brother, Sale.
“The first one died on the first of November, the other one on the eighth, and the last one on the 16th,” their mother, Fa’aoso, explains through a translator. Such death and suffering may seem far away, but 2019 has seen measles – once regarded as a candidate for eradication from the planet – surge back to kill more than 100,000 internationally.
Samoa’s perfect storm raises urgent questions. If its lessons can be learnt, countless children’s lives might be saved around the world.

During the islands’ lockdown, Apia’s streets were silent. On the Beach Road seafront, where the magnificent Samoan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception hosted prayers for the victims, only police or sporadic emergency vehicles prowled as the vaccination campaign (with shots now compulsory under emergency laws) moved from home to home.
Even on Ififi Street, cutting sharply inland, evidence of activity was minimal. At the redbrick and concrete TTM hospital, where for weeks security tables have defended the paediatrics ward and intensive care unit, life-or-death struggles play out in private.
We met families who described appalling scenes. One mother, Moana Lefauaitu, 38, spoke of being asked to wait in a TTM corridor while staff switched off the ventilator and detached the tubes from her 14-month-old daughter, Si’la’e.
“After 24 hours on the intensive care unit, they said her body cannot take any more treatment because she had already been given strong medicine,” she says quietly, as rain hammers a tin roof above us, in her family’s modest clapboard bungalow. “So they said they couldn’t give her more.”
An hour later she was presented with her child’s body, wrapped in a blanket, which her husband Oli carried to their car. The girl was then driven home and buried beneath a guava tree, three feet from the family’s front steps.
In a bid to quell the measles outbreak, the government of this tiny Polynesian nation has resorted to banning all but essential movement on the islands
As such tragedies unfolded, Upolu was calm. But on the less developed island of Savai’i that Thursday afternoon, police broke the stillness by arresting Edwin Tamasese, a self-styled “traditional healer”. He’d not only contested the immunisation drive, but discouraged life-saving antibiotics.
“I'll be here to mop up your mess,” Tamasese, also the chair of a coconut farmers’ collective, goaded the government in an online post. “Enjoy your killing spree.”
Hauled away to jail, and facing up to two years in prison, he had fallen foul of the most draconian measures yet invoked anywhere in the world to quell a measles outbreak.
Many countries, including France and Germany, have passed recent laws making vaccination compulsory. And, during an epidemic in a suburb of New York City last March, an emergency order was issued banning anyone without a doctor’s note from any place of public assembly. And yet, internationally, the stats are getting worse.
Preliminary World Health Organization (WH0) estimates for 2019 point to a tripling of reported infections over 2018: themselves double the previous year’s. In Europe, major outbreaks have burst from the East like cluster bombs.
Romania, Italy, Greece, Serbia, France and Britain have all been hit. In South Asia, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, Thailand and Myanmar have also suffered. And then there is the catastrophe unfolding in the Democratic Republic of Congo where estimates talk of 5,000 dead.

Confronted by such consequences, anti-vaccine campaigners like Tamasese have struggled to deny responsibility. “The issue is the vaccine compared to the individual,” he told Stuff, a New Zealand-based media group, before being detained and charged.
“If you’re putting the vaccine into a healthy, fully-functioning, fully nutritionally complete human being, this vaccine is probably likely not going to be an issue. “[But] if you put it into someone who has got a compromised immune system because they’ve got low nutritional profiles, then you’re going to have a dangerous vaccine.”
It’s a new line of gobbledegook currently being spread by anti-vaccine campaigners around the world, most notably in the United States. The American lawyer, Robert Kennedy, nephew of the murdered president, John Kennedy is one of the main proponents.
In an extraordinary four-page letter to the Samoan prime minister, Kennedy suggested that the measles vaccine itself might be the true cause of the crisis, somehow creating a “mutant strain” of the disease.
Calling the mass vaccination drive in Samoa a “travesty”, Sherri Tenpenny, an American osteopath and prominent anti-vaxxer, followed Kennedy’s prompt. In an online essay titled “The Real Crisis in Samoa,” she sought to link the arrival of more than 100,000 doses of MMR with the outbreak of the disease in October.
“Within a month, hundreds of cases of measles were reported and the government declared an emergency on November 15”, she wrote, suggesting that these supplies were somehow the cause of the illness, “leading to mass vaccination of everyone”.

Schools have been shut and a curfew imposed for children

Some have gone even further in their efforts to deny what amounts to a natural experiment in a society when you remove a vital protection.
“They [70 Soman children] are dead because of lack of nutrition, lack of hygiene and sanitation,” claimed Angelika Stalman, an anti-vaxxer and self-styled “brand strategist” on Twitter on December 9. “Their bodies are being assaulted with toxic vaccines improperly stored and made in India; and then wrongly treated with glutathione depleting acetaminophens and antibiotics.”
Such soups of speculation and amateur science can be traced back over three decades to a man who many consider to be the architect of the anti-vaccine revival. This is Andrew Wakefield, 63, the disgraced former British doctor who in the late 1990s falsified research to undermine the MMR vaccine.
Although struck off the British medical register in May 2010, Wakefield has continued his mission in the United States, not only to to provoke parents’ fear of MMR, but to suggest that all vaccines are unsafe.
“If I had a baby, I would not vaccinate them,” he says, sometimes turning up at disease outbreaks himself, or supporting surrogates such as Kennedy. If Wakefield appeared in Samoa, he would probably face arrest. But he and his associates have reached into this nation. His hand in the crisis, like the virus itself, has been mediated through passage in New Zealand.
Like much of the English-speaking world, New Zealand – with which Samoa has a long historic bond – has suffered the impact of Wakefield’s efforts ever since he came to prominence in the 1990s.
After New Zealand had achieved MMR coverage levels up to 92 per cent of young children, publicity for his claims – spuriously linking the vaccine initially to bowel disease and then to autism in children – sent them tumbling to dangerous lows.
The vaccination drive and two-day lockdown is globally unprecedented
Islanders arrive at a walk-in health clinic to be immunised
Measles outbreaks followed across New Zealand’s North and South Islands. In 2009, nearly 250 cases were officially notified. In 2011, it was almost 500. In 2013, another 133 were reported – since when it has barely gone away. Until that time, Wakefield’s weapons had been the media and the web. But, in August 2017, he extended his reach into this southern seas tinderbox with a full-on campaign against the vaccine.
Sending a partner, Polly Tommey, an English autism entrepreneur, to tour with a film called “Vaxxed”, making untrue claims, he galvanised campaigners in Samoa’s former colonial ruler, laying the ground for what has now followed. New Zealand’s next outbreak would be the biggest yet.
Taking off in February, just 10 months ago, this would see the country shaken by a resurgence of such severity that, by the time of Samoa’s two-day lockdown, it would total more than 2,000 confirmed measles cases. Almost 80 per cent of those were in New Zealand’s biggest city, Auckland, where on the south side is a large Pacific Islander community.
And not only does this enjoy family links to Samoa, but daily flights to and from Apia. Last year, more than 80,000 such journeys were logged between the nations. And it is believed that from a passenger on one such trip, last August, the virus jumped from Auckland to Upolu.
On day two of the lockdown, we witnessed the results. In the lanes and tracks around Apia, we stopped at the homes of yet more families who had lost sons or daughters to measles. Since I had last met Wakefield, he had announced a new theory that perfectly meshed with Kennedy’s.
As the death toll rises, islanders attend prayer services at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral
Sidelining earlier claims that the live measles virus in MMR caused bowel disease and autism, the ex-doctor had decided that measles infections were evolving to be “mild”, and that the historic fall in deaths and sickness from the disease had “nothing to do with vaccination”.
He had no qualifications, or specialist training, to validate his unsupported opinions. Virologists I spoke with denied his claims as efforts to escape culpability. And if he and Kennedy could have toured withTheTelegraphthat Friday, they might have left better informed.
Likewise, those such as Tamasese who discounted the deaths as the result of poverty and poor nutrition. Samoa isn’t rich, but it is not a Third World nation. It’s classified as “lower-middle income”.
“We’re not really seeing evidence of acute malnutrition,” says the British paediatrician Dr Owens, who arrived from the UK on the same flight as me. “As I understand it, there is very little evidence of clinical vitamin A deficiency. And I’ve not met a patient yet with a defined immune deficiency.”
Yet measles ripped through the communities around Apia, as it did other hotspots on Upolu and Savai’i, with a horrifying, life-stealing speed. The first house we called at was a blue-walled bungalow, near the Vaisigano River, where most of the local community of maybe 1,000 prepares and sells street food around the markets in Apia, a 10-minute drive north west.
Rispani, a 15-month-old boy, succumbed to the virus
14-month-old girl Si'la'e Lefaua also died
We met Selima Masoe, aged 67, the grandmother of a 15-month-old boy, Rispani, who had died just three days before. Unlike Lefauaitu’s daughter, he was admitted to the morgue at TTM hospital, and the family were still waiting for his body. “The government should have done something,” Selima complains, in translation. “And the people forgot to pray.”
What she might have told visitors such as Wakefield and Kennedy was how obviously the virus had spread. Three weeks before we met, a 28-year-old nephew had come to the house coughing, with a fever, and a blotchy pink rash on his face.
He stayed for a week and recovered from his ordeal. But he infected Rispani, Selima’s little grandson, who fell ill and was rushed to the hospital. At our next stop, the link was yet more striking. The deceased child – a 14-month-old girl named Adriana Leuluaialii – was infected by her father, a 26-year-old police officer, who had picked up the bug from a colleague.
The girl’s grandmother, Fuatino, 56, recounts the story, seated by the girl’s grave on the family’s six-acre plantation, 20 minutes west of the capital. Here they lived off the land, grew six banana varieties and three kinds of mango, plus coconuts, papayas, sweet potatoes, pineapples, breadfruit, and even planted their own coffee.
“He’s blaming himself for bringing the virus that killed his daughter,” Fuatino, 56, tells us of her son’s double agony. “I told him he was the reason she got sick.”
With my face running with sweat and tears in my eyes, I ask our translator, Pai Mulitalo Ale, to tell her that I’d followed the measles story for more than a decade, and that Adriana’s death wasn’t down to her father. Indeed, nor was Wakefield the proximate cause, despite all his efforts over the years.

According to estimates by the WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund, Unicef, just six years ago Samoan uptake of MMR was running at around 90 per cent.
That’s just five per cent shy of the figure virologists cite as necessary to stymie the virus completely – and roughly the same as in Britain. But for the next four years the coverage was allowed to fall, to around only 62 per cent. And then, even under the watch of the WHO and Unicef, came a largely self-inflicted disaster.
It was a lethal mistake that would send two nurses to prison. On July 6 last year, at a 20-bed hospital on the east coast of Savai’i, they administered a powdered version of MMR, which one of the nurses wrongly mixed with an expired anaesthetic. Two 12-month-old children – a girl and a boy – died, hours apart, and in minutes.
Both nurses were arrested. Confessions came quickly. And the reason for the deaths was known to the government within three weeks of the incident, or sooner. But, after suspending MMR as an initial precaution, they left it suspended for almost nine months, as if someone in the ministry of health, on the other side of Ififi Street from the TTM hospital, had forgotten to change the instruction.
In recent weeks, the ministry has offered no explanation. And when I meet the deputy director of health, Gaualofa Matalavea Saaga, to ask permission to visit the hospital, she makes it clear that publicity isn’t welcome. “Having our case blasted out to the world is the last thing we want,” she says.
Although the government has announced that mandatory vaccination would remain the law permanently, the health ministry’s earlier dawdling left MMR uptake falling to less than one third of children vaccinated by the age of two. And, despite a string of warnings about the epidemic in Auckland, little was done about Samoa’s mounting vulnerability until a few weeks before the crisis.

“It was obvious to me what was going to happen,” Sapeer Mayron, a New Zealander reporter with the daily Samoan Observer newspaper, tells us. “And I have no medical qualifications.”
What happened was death, suffering and family guilt on a scale that the Samoa’s tiny political opposition – calling for the health minister to be fired from his post – insists was an accident waiting to happen.
It was an accident, moreover, which the government won’t acknowledge, as I discover at a press conference, given by prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, outside the Central Bank of Samoa. Seated at a makeshift folding table under a white tent canopy, the 74-year-old head of government, in power since 1998, laughs and cracks jokes during discussion of the outbreak, and shrugs off questions fromThe Telegraph.
He had accused the public of a “lackadaisical attitude”, said he had seen red flags within yards of a hospital, and criticised traditional healers. But when I voice concerns, raised by families, that he appeared to blame his own people for a foreseeable calamity, and I ask him whether he thought that he ought to apologise, he changes the subject, asking where I’m from, and demanding to know what I’d written about Brexit.
“You are wrong, we’re not blaming them, we are educating them,” he says. “You do not know because you are not a Samoan.”

Title: Samoa's perfect storm: How a collapse in vaccination rates killed more than 70 children

In an online essay titled “The Real Crisis in Samoa,” she sought to link the arrival of more than 100,000 doses of MMR with the outbreak of the disease in October.
“Within a month, hundreds of cases of measles were reported and the government declared an emergency on November 15”, she wrote, suggesting that these supplies were somehow the cause of the illness, “leading to mass vaccination of everyone”.


Businesses are closed during the day during the vaccination drive
Schools have been shut and a curfew imposed for children
During the islands’ lockdown, Apia’s streets have been silent
Some have gone even further in their efforts to deny what amounts to a natural experiment in a society when you remove a vital protection.
“They [70 Soman children] are dead because of lack of nutrition, lack of hygiene and sanitation,” claimed Angelika Stalman, an anti-vaxxer and self-styled “brand strategist” on Twitter on December 9. “Their bodies are being assaulted with toxic vaccines improperly stored and made in India; and then wrongly treated with glutathione depleting acetaminophens and antibiotics.”
Such soups of speculation and amateur science can be traced back over three decades to a man who many consider to be the architect of the anti-vaccine revival. This is Andrew Wakefield, 63, the disgraced former British doctor who in the late 1990s falsified research to undermine the MMR vaccine.
Although struck off the British medical register in May 2010, Wakefield has continued his mission in the United States, not only to to provoke parents’ fear of MMR, but to suggest that all vaccines are unsafe.
“If I had a baby, I would not vaccinate them,” he says, sometimes turning up at disease outbreaks himself, or supporting surrogates such as Kennedy. If Wakefield appeared in Samoa, he would probably face arrest. But he and his associates have reached into this nation. His hand in the crisis, like the virus itself, has been mediated through passage in New Zealand.
Like much of the English-speaking world, New Zealand – with which Samoa has a long historic bond – has suffered the impact of Wakefield’s efforts ever since he came to prominence in the 1990s.
After New Zealand had achieved MMR coverage levels up to 92 per cent of young children, publicity for his claims – spuriously linking the vaccine initially to bowel disease and then to autism in children – sent them tumbling to dangerous lows.

The vaccination drive and two-day lockdown is globally unprecedented
Islanders arrive at a walk-in health clinic to be immunised
Measles outbreaks followed across New Zealand’s North and South Islands. In 2009, nearly 250 cases were officially notified. In 2011, it was almost 500. In 2013, another 133 were reported – since when it has barely gone away. Until that time, Wakefield’s weapons had been the media and the web. But, in August 2017, he extended his reach into this southern seas tinderbox with a full-on campaign against the vaccine.
Sending a partner, Polly Tommey, an English autism entrepreneur, to tour with a film called “Vaxxed”, making untrue claims, he galvanised campaigners in Samoa’s former colonial ruler, laying the ground for what has now followed. New Zealand’s next outbreak would be the biggest yet.
Taking off in February, just 10 months ago, this would see the country shaken by a resurgence of such severity that, by the time of Samoa’s two-day lockdown, it would total more than 2,000 confirmed measles cases. Almost 80 per cent of those were in New Zealand’s biggest city, Auckland, where on the south side is a large Pacific Islander community.
And not only does this enjoy family links to Samoa, but daily flights to and from Apia. Last year, more than 80,000 such journeys were logged between the nations. And it is believed that from a passenger on one such trip, last August, the virus jumped from Auckland to Upolu.
On day two of the lockdown, we witnessed the results. In the lanes and tracks around Apia, we stopped at the homes of yet more families who had lost sons or daughters to measles. Since I had last met Wakefield, he had announced a new theory that perfectly meshed with Kennedy’s.
As the death toll rises, islanders attend prayer services at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral
Sidelining earlier claims that the live measles virus in MMR caused bowel disease and autism, the ex-doctor had decided that measles infections were evolving to be “mild”, and that the historic fall in deaths and sickness from the disease had “nothing to do with vaccination”.
He had no qualifications, or specialist training, to validate his unsupported opinions. Virologists I spoke with denied his claims as efforts to escape culpability. And if he and Kennedy could have toured withTheTelegraphthat Friday, they might have left better informed.
Likewise, those such as Tamasese who discounted the deaths as the result of poverty and poor nutrition. Samoa isn’t rich, but it is not a Third World nation. It’s classified as “lower-middle income”.
“We’re not really seeing evidence of acute malnutrition,” says the British paediatrician Dr Owens, who arrived from the UK on the same flight as me. “As I understand it, there is very little evidence of clinical vitamin A deficiency. And I’ve not met a patient yet with a defined immune deficiency.”
Yet measles ripped through the communities around Apia, as it did other hotspots on Upolu and Savai’i, with a horrifying, life-stealing speed. The first house we called at was a blue-walled bungalow, near the Vaisigano River, where most of the local community of maybe 1,000 prepares and sells street food around the markets in Apia, a 10-minute drive north west.
Rispani, a 15-month-old boy, succumbed to the virus
14-month-old girl Si'la'e Lefaua also died
We met Selima Masoe, aged 67, the grandmother of a 15-month-old boy, Rispani, who had died just three days before. Unlike Lefauaitu’s daughter, he was admitted to the morgue at TTM hospital, and the family were still waiting for his body. “The government should have done something,” Selima complains, in translation. “And the people forgot to pray.”
What she might have told visitors such as Wakefield and Kennedy was how obviously the virus had spread. Three weeks before we met, a 28-year-old nephew had come to the house coughing, with a fever, and a blotchy pink rash on his face.
He stayed for a week and recovered from his ordeal. But he infected Rispani, Selima’s little grandson, who fell ill and was rushed to the hospital. At our next stop, the link was yet more striking. The deceased child – a 14-month-old girl named Adriana Leuluaialii – was infected by her father, a 26-year-old police officer, who had picked up the bug from a colleague.
The girl’s grandmother, Fuatino, 56, recounts the story, seated by the girl’s grave on the family’s six-acre plantation, 20 minutes west of the capital. Here they lived off the land, grew six banana varieties and three kinds of mango, plus coconuts, papayas, sweet potatoes, pineapples, breadfruit, and even planted their own coffee.
“He’s blaming himself for bringing the virus that killed his daughter,” Fuatino, 56, tells us of her son’s double agony. “I told him he was the reason she got sick.”
With my face running with sweat and tears in my eyes, I ask our translator, Pai Mulitalo Ale, to tell her that I’d followed the measles story for more than a decade, and that Adriana’s death wasn’t down to her father. Indeed, nor was Wakefield the proximate cause, despite all his efforts over the years.


Samoan prime minister Susuga Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi holds a press conference during the two-day action
According to estimates by the WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund, Unicef, just six years ago Samoan uptake of MMR was running at around 90 per cent.
That’s just five per cent shy of the figure virologists cite as necessary to stymie the virus completely – and roughly the same as in Britain. But for the next four years the coverage was allowed to fall, to around only 62 per cent. And then, even under the watch of the WHO and Unicef, came a largely self-inflicted disaster.
It was a lethal mistake that would send two nurses to prison. On July 6 last year, at a 20-bed hospital on the east coast of Savai’i, they administered a powdered version of MMR, which one of the nurses wrongly mixed with an expired anaesthetic. Two 12-month-old children – a girl and a boy – died, hours apart, and in minutes.
Both nurses were arrested. Confessions came quickly. And the reason for the deaths was known to the government within three weeks of the incident, or sooner. But, after suspending MMR as an initial precaution, they left it suspended for almost nine months, as if someone in the ministry of health, on the other side of Ififi Street from the TTM hospital, had forgotten to change the instruction.
In recent weeks, the ministry has offered no explanation. And when I meet the deputy director of health, Gaualofa Matalavea Saaga, to ask permission to visit the hospital, she makes it clear that publicity isn’t welcome. “Having our case blasted out to the world is the last thing we want,” she says.
Although the government has announced that mandatory vaccination would remain the law permanently, the health ministry’s earlier dawdling left MMR uptake falling to less than one third of children vaccinated by the age of two. And, despite a string of warnings about the epidemic in Auckland, little was done about Samoa’s mounting vulnerability until a few weeks before the crisis.
Kaioneta, 4, recovered from measles but still bares the rashes on his legs
The grandmother of six-month-old Adam Samuelu and one-year-old Lologa Samuelu rests her hands on their grave
“It was obvious to me what was going to happen,” Sapeer Mayron, a New Zealander reporter with the daily Samoan Observer newspaper, tells us. “And I have no medical qualifications.”
What happened was death, suffering and family guilt on a scale that the Samoa’s tiny political opposition – calling for the health minister to be fired from his post – insists was an accident waiting to happen.
It was an accident, moreover, which the government won’t acknowledge, as I discover at a press conference, given by prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, outside the Central Bank of Samoa. Seated at a makeshift folding table under a white tent canopy, the 74-year-old head of government, in power since 1998, laughs and cracks jokes during discussion of the outbreak, and shrugs off questions fromThe Telegraph.
He had accused the public of a “lackadaisical attitude”, said he had seen red flags within yards of a hospital, and criticised traditional healers. But when I voice concerns, raised by families, that he appeared to blame his own people for a foreseeable calamity, and I ask him whether he thought that he ought to apologise, he changes the subject, asking where I’m from, and demanding to know what I’d written about Brexit.
“You are wrong, we’re not blaming them, we are educating them,” he says. “You do not know because you are not a Samoan.”

Title:  Bangkok Post - Family of Myanmar insurgency leader detained in Thailand
Immigration police arrest wife and children of Arakan Army chief in Chiang Mai
PUBLISHED : 7 Dec 2019 at 15:08
Thai authorities confirm that they have detained the wife and children of a top commander of the Arakan Army, an insurgent group who are fighting for greater autonomy in Rakhine state in northwestern Myanmar.
Hnin Zar Phyu, 38, the wife of Maj Gen Tun Myat Naing, 41, and their daughter Saw Pyae Shun, 11, and 11-month-old son, Myat Lin Zan, were arrested on Wednesday in Chiang Mai.
Thai officials told Reuters that Hnin Zar Phyu and her children were being detained at an immigration office in Mae Sai district of Chiang Rai.
“We are currently investigating her case and they are still in Thailand,” said a Thai immigration official, who did not wish to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media. “She is being charged with illegal entry because the Myanmar authorities have revoked her passport.”
Rakhine state, also known as Arakan, came to global attention after 730,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed into Bangladesh, fleeing a military crackdown in Myanmar after militant attacks in 2017.
More recently, civilians there have been caught up in clashes between the military and the Arakan Army, which recruits mostly from the Rakhine Buddhist majority. More than 35,000 people have been displaced this year, according to the United Nations.
Myanmar has designated the army a terrorist organisation.
A Rakhine activist said he was deeply concerned by the detention of Hnin Zar Phyu in Thailand.
“They should not arrest and deport her to Myanmar authorities because it is well founded that she will be arrested, jailed and persecuted in Myanmar,” said Nyi Nyi Lwin, the head of the Arakan Information Center.
“Arresting Tun Myat Naing’s wife is not very good ... and it will create more conflict between the Rakhine people and the government and the Myanmar Tatmadaw [army]. It will never end, it will go on and on,” he said.
In July, Singaporean authorities arrested and deported a group of Myanmar nationals with links to the Arakan Army, saying their activities caused “security concerns”.

BANGKOK, Dec 6 — The Thai authorities have detained the wife and children of a top commander of Arakan Army, an insurgent group who are fighting for greater autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar’s Rakhine State, Thai officials told Reuters today.

Thai officials have confirmed that Hnin Zar Phyu and her children are being detained at an immigration office in Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai province, a major border crossing on the Thai-Myanmar border in northern Thailand. “We are currently investigating her case and they are still in Thailand,” a Thai immigration official, who did not wish to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters. “She is being charged with illegal entry because the Myanmar authorities have revoked her passport.”

Title: Rakhine Rebels Say Myanmar Official Killed in Fighting 
Print
Rebels in Myanmar's Rakhine region said a captured official from Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling party has died, two weeks after being taken for organizing protests against genocide accusations faced by Myanmar at the World Court.
The Arakan Army rebels said Buthidaung National League for Democracy (NLD) Chairman Ye Thein, the most senior civilian official to die in the growing insurgency, was killed Monday in an attack on the rebels by Myanmar's army.
There was no independent confirmation.
The incident underscored the increasing loss of government control in a region that came to world attention when 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh to escape an army crackdown on a different rebel group in 2017.
The Arakan Army said its positions had come under attack from Myanmar's army.
"Due to big explosions, some detainees died and some were wounded. The NLD chairman from Buthidaung, Ye Thein, died on scene," the Arakan Army said in the statement. It said he had been taken prisoner on December 11.
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Rakhine since clashes between the Arakan Army and the army began around a year ago.
The insurgents, whose forces are from the largely Buddhist Rakhine people, are fighting for greater autonomy. The say they have no links to the Rohingya rebel group whose attacks sparked the 2017 army crackdown that led to the accusations of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice by The Gambia.
The Arakan Army is among several ethnic armed factions that have said they support the case against Myanmar.
Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto ruler, personally led Myanmar's defense against the accusations at hearings in The Hague earlier this month.
The army made no comment on the report of the NLD official's death. NLD party spokesman Myo Nyunt said it was the responsibility of the Arakan Army.

Title: Landmine Use Must Be Stopped in Myanmar’s Armed Conflict - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG 20 December 2019
It was painful to hear that Daw Aye Ngwe, mother of three children, was injured in the leg last week when a landmine exploded in her tea plantation in Namhsan Township, northern Shan State.
None of her family members could take care of her in the hospital as her three children are young and her husband had to take care of them.
Daw Aye Ngwe is one of many internally displaced people (IDPs) in northern Shan State. She left her village in Namhsan with her family on Nov. 16 because the Myanmar military and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) were fighting in the village, according to the Ta’ang Women Organization (TWO), a civil society organization promoting human rights and the rights of women.
Her family returned to the village on Dec. 12. She was hit by the landmine when she visited her tea plantation just two days after she came back to her village, on Dec. 14.
TWO reported that a man, U Hla Aung, was also hit by a landmine on the same day as Daw Aye Nge. Both of them were in the same township, though in different villages.
We often hear about local people being injured or killed by landmines in northern Shan State. Last month, a German tourist was even killed by a landmine in Hsipaw Township while driving a motorbike.
UNICEF has been working with the Landmine Monitor, an international civil society group, to conduct research on the impacts of landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) in Myanmar. In 2017, they recorded 176 landmine casualties in Myanmar, increasing to 278 in 2018. From January to September this year, there have been 168 landmine casualties in only three states: Shan, Rakhine and Kachin.
Shan State has the highest number of casualties from landmines, according to UNICEF. This year, there have been reports of 19 people killed in Shan State and 59 others injured. Rakhine has the second-highest number of casualties, with 13 people killed and 27 wounded. Kachin State ranks third: six people have been killed and 24 have been wounded.
U Win Naing Tun, the director-general of Myanmar’s Rehabilitation Department, told a mine action workshop in Naypyitaw on Oct. 30 that over 40 people have been killed and more than 160 injured by landmines in 2019.
Armed groups use landmines because they’re cheap—the groups don’t have to spend money on shooting their enemies. But ideas like this are causing many local people to be hurt and killed.
When I reported from the frontlines of the conflict in Shan State in 2017, I found that the Myanmar army used antipersonnel mines in fighting with the TNLA—just a day before I was arrested by the army. When the Myanmar military withdrew their troops from the area, members of the TNLA found those antipersonnel mines in the area where the two sides had fought.
According to the 2018 Landmine Monitor report, the Myanmar military is the only government army in the world that is still using antipersonnel mines. The Landmine Monitor has been recording the use of landmines in Myanmar since 1999.
While conducting interviews for this article, local residents in northern Shan reported that the TNLA has also used landmines in attempts to target the Myanmar army. But local residents have also been hit by these mines. When asked whether they use landmines on the frontline, all sides of the conflict deny it.
Casualties from landmines have increased this month in Kyaukme and Namhsan townships, according to local sources. Some civilians have been killed and others wounded as landmines continue to hit civilians, and not soldiers.
Mai Ah Bam is a volunteer working with local rescue group Ong Tamauk to respond to landmine incidents in the area. He told The Irrawaddy that his group has helped respond to six landmine casualties already in December—two people killed and four wounded in Kyaukme Township.
There is still ongoing fighting between the Myanmar military and the TNLA in Kyaukme and Namhsan townships. Fighting has also broken out between the TNLA and rival ethnic armed group the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS).
Most local people in the area are farmers, many working on tea plantations. Tea is the main local business: if they are unable to go to the plantations, they can’t work and they can’t eat. Now when they go to the plantations, they are afraid of the landmines but they have no other option but to work.
Civilians need protection. There are several NGOs based in northern Shan State, lending their voices to local people, but they don’t dare point out who is planting landmines. It isn’t safe to name names. As a result, local people don’t know where to turn for help to stop armed groups from using landmines.
Landmines are most commonly found in areas where armed groups have fought each other. Local people leave their villages when fighting breaks out nearby. When they come back, they step on the landmines left by the armed groups.
Armed conflict in northern Shan State won’t end soon. But leaders from armed groups should consider the civilians in the area—those who are not their enemies. These are the people bearing the cost of the conflict: they have lost limbs and become disabled for their whole lives.
The use of landmines and killing or maiming of civilians are human rights abuses. The armed groups that engage in these acts should be punished, if they have committed rights abuses. All armed groups, including the Myanmar military, must respect the UN Mine Ban Treaty, whether or not Myanmar as a country has signed it.

Title: ‘We Are Humans’: Shan State IDPs Endure as Myanmar Military, TNLA Continue Clashes - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By NAN LWIN HNIN PWINT
KYAUKME, Shan State—It is a bad sign for civilians in northern Shan State that lavish peace talks held at luxurious hotels in big towns with sumptuous feasts and full security services have stalled.
As clashes have renewed while peace talks have stalled, small villages in mountainous areas have been brought to the verge of collapse.
Over 300 civilians from Khunkaw, Tawphel and Ohnwe villages in Kyaukme Township fled clashes on Nov. 11. Since then, the internally displace people (IDPs) have been taking shelter in Pan Nin Village-Tract in Namhsan Township.
The civilians fled for their lives as artillery shells fell into their villages amid clashes between the Myanmar military and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), walking through the forest for hours to reach a safe place. They don’t know what has happened to their villages since they fled.
“We had to run as many artillery shells fell. We could not bring anything, not even the bed,” said U Ar Yu, the administrator of Ohnwe Village.
Six residents of Ohnwe Village, however, were trapped. A blind person and two people with physical disabilities were left and three of their relatives chose to stay to take care of them, said community elder U Min Aung. He added that they have no telephones so no one knows their current situation.
U Min Aung said that other local residents didn’t want to leave the six behind but they had to take care of their own family members and the three disabled people chose to stay in the village.
“Other villagers have children and grandparents [to take care of]. They had to carry them on their backs as they fled,” said U Min Aung.
Clashes spare no one
If they are unlucky, the six people trapped by the fighting may have been injured in the clashes. An armed group may have detained or investigated them. But local residents hope that they will be lucky enough to have a reunion with them.
Residents from the three villages first took shelter at a nearby village called Khon Ngin. But as TNLA fighters were in the village, they knew that fighting could break at any time. As they predicted, the violence spread to Khon Ngin and they had to flee once again on Nov. 16.
After walking through the forest for nine more hours, they arrived at Pan Nin Village in Namhsan Township.
“We don’t know the way and we slogged through bushes in the forest. We left around 2 p.m. and arrived at Pan Nin around 11 p.m.,” said U Aung Than, one of the displaced.
As the two sides had deployed troops along the roads linking villages, the villagers had to run and stick to the cover of bushes, he said.
Pan Nin Village-Tract administrator U Win Myint arranged accommodation for the displaced civilians. He put out a request on social media for donations from Ta’ang civil society organizations to feed the displaced, but only a few donors came, in part because the Myanmar military prohibited them from going to Pan Nin. Local residents contributed their own food for the displaced people.
Tensions between the Tatmadaw, as the military is known, and the TNLA are growing near the village and Pan Nin alone can’t take care of the three displaced villages. U Win Myint has now sent displaced people from Khunkaw and Tawphel villages to Kyauktaw and Kheykwe villages, respectively, also in Pan Nin Village-Tract.
But the situation is still far from safe. Local residents in Pan Nin said the military bombed villages in Namhsan Township on a daily basis from Nov. 16-24 using helicopters.
The information department of the TNLA said the Tatmadaw shelled places in Kyaukme and Namhsan townships 404 times between Nov. 11 and 26. The TNLA also claimed that most of the shells fell on civilian areas and not on TNLA outposts.
Military spokesperson Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said that because both sides have carried out artillery attacks, it is difficult to say which side is responsible for shells that fall near villages.
Brig-Gen Zaw Min Tun added that the military took control of a TNLA arms cache near Kyet They Village, also called Kai Tai Village, where they seized 33 grenades, 14 mines and military equipment. The village is located in the hills on the border of Kyaukme and Namhsan townships.
“Most of the clashes happened near Kai Tai Village,” Brig-Gen Zaw Min Tun said.
Brig-Gen Zaw Min Tun declined to answer how many shells the military fired in those clashes.
The Tatmadaw reported seizing over 40,000 weapons, including RPGs and FN6 surface-to-air missiles, at three arms caches belonging to the TNLA during its search of areas surrounding Homein Village in Namhsan Township on Nov. 22.
Local residents are in a state of constant panic as they have seen helicopters flying over their villages every day.
“Every day, [military helicopters] fly over our village and bomb the places where clashes are ongoing. We are worried that we will be hit one day,” said Pan Nin Village-Tract administrator U Win Myint. He said that Kyet They, Ar Pyaung and Nar Lway villages and their surroundings have all been targeted in these bombings.
Over 800 civilians from those three villages have fled from their homes and are taking shelter at Kayukphyulay Village in Namhsan Township and Mankhauk Village in Kyaukme Township. On the ground, those who have not yet fled are helping those have fled.
Local residents in Mongngawt, Kyaukme Township said the military unit based in their area had been firing artillery shells throughout the month of November and they are used to hearing it.
“Not even the children are afraid of those sounds. [The military] shot at the hills. We have heard that sound almost daily this month [November],” said restaurant owner Nan Kham of Mongngawt.
Compared to other hillside villages around it, Mongngawt is safer because it is surrounded by Tatmadaw military outposts, said locals.
A reporter for The Irrawaddy was in Mongngawt around noon on Nov. 26 and saw and heard three artillery shells fired from Mongngawt toward Pan Nin, which is around a two-hour motorbike drive from Mongngawt.
The shells fell on Panpaw Village in Pan Nin. Shortly afterwards, Panpaw residents fled on motorbikes toward Kyaukme, with three or four people sharing a motorbike along with bunches of clothes.
Gugin, a 15-year-old resident, was carrying three little girls on his motorbike.
“A clash is about to begin. Artillery shells fell on our village. There are a lot of TNLA soldiers in the village. They said at least one person must stay in each house. So, my father stayed. I am sending my sisters to Kyaukme,” he told The Irrawaddy.
He added that the roads leading to villages in the hills are not safe because the TNLA usually plants mines on those roads between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m., before rushing back to his motorbike and driving toward Kyaukme.
At the same time, U Win Myint was worried that artillery shells would fall in villages in Pan Nin Village-Tract. If more clashes happen in Pan Nin, local residents and displaced people have nowhere to run, he said.
“I am always obsessed about the possibility of artillery shells falling on our village. In the middle of the night, I wake up with anxiety and I hear the sounds of shelling. We are humans—please spare us,” he said, crying.
He said he was feeling suffocated by his responsibility to take care of his villagers and the displaced people taking shelter in his village. He said he wants to go back to living a peaceful life as soon as possible.
As clashes continue on the ground, there are also disagreements between the TNLA and the military over their territories. The Tatmadaw has demanded that the TNLA operate only in Mantong and Namhsan townships—the two townships that make up the Palaung Self-Administered Zone—but the TNLA is active across northern Shan State. The two sides are also attempting to negotiate a bilateral ceasefire agreement.
“They are holding talks but it is not connected to the fighting on the ground. I want to ask them to stop fighting. We are the victims of the clashes. We have to be afraid of both sides,” said U Win Myint.
It is a customary practice for village administrators to provide accommodation and meals for any armed groups visiting their village. In times of clashes, villagers say they do not feel safe being together with soldiers from any side. Though local residents in northern Shan State don’t always talk openly about their feelings, their faces reflect fear and anxiety as their future remains uncertain.
Infants and the elderly are also bearing the brunt of clashes between the Tatmadaw and the TNLA. Daw Aye Kywe, one of those displaced in northern Shan State, fled from the violence when her baby was just four months old. Like her fellow displaced residents, she lacked blankets and warm clothes to shield her and her child against the cold. At the camp in Pan Nin Village-Tract, she has to live together with around 50 other people. She said she does not want to flee again through the forest in the cold December weather without blankets.
“All I can do is to pray that the two sides will reach an agreement,” she said.

Title: The Restoration Council of Shan State signs Geneva Call’s Deed of Commitment for the Protection of Children from the Effects of Armed Conflict - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
The Restoration Council of Shan State / Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) has committed to prohibiting the use of children in hostilities and to ensuring that children are not recruited by or forcibly associated with armed forces. A party to one of the world’s longest-running civil wars in Shan State, Burma/Myanmar, RCSS/SSA has been working for several years with Geneva Call to plan for the concrete implementation of thisDeed of Commitment. General Yawd Serk, Chairman of the RCSS/SSA and Alain Délétroz, General Director of Geneva Call signed theDeedon the 26 November 2019 following final agreement on key implementation points.
By signing thisDeed of Commitment, RCSS/SSA not only reinforces its policy not to use or recruit children under the age of 18, but it further commits to ensuring the safe release or disassociation of any children who may be found among their ranks now or in the future. Under theDeed of Commitment, RCSS/SSA pledges to protect all children from the effects of military operations and to make the best possible efforts to facilitate the provision of necessary humanitarian aid and care to all children in Shan State.
RCSS and Geneva Call have been working for years to train troops on the respect of child protection norms, an endeavor which it will expand following the signing.
In his speech marking the occasion, the Chairman of RCSS/SSA, Gen. Yawd Serk, stated that “This event marks a key positive milestone for RCSS/SSA to adhere to humanitarian norms. Children are the most important – they are the new generation. By signing thisDeed of Commitmentand taking concrete steps with Geneva Call to ensure its full implementation, RCSS/SSA commits to work for the greater protection of all children in Shan State. Tomorrow I will issue an order to all RCSS/SSA commanders to remind them not to recruit children and to review their current forces”
Alain Délétroz, General Director of Geneva Call, welcomed this commitment by RCSS/SSA, saying, “This is a crucial step towards the better protection of all children affected by conflict in Shan State and across Myanmar. It marks a new phase in the ongoing humanitarian engagement by RCSS/SSA and Geneva Call, and launches a joint monitoring process to support RCSS/SSA in adhering to their policy banning the use and recruitment of children. Geneva Call is committing to support the humanitarian efforts of RCSS/SSA to improve the situation of all children affected by the conflict – including those most vulnerable, those separated from their families, and those who have been displaced.” By strengthening the protection of children in Shan State, this signing can inspire other armed actors operating in Myanmar to make new commitments related to child protection and better uphold those that have been made. The signing can contribute to positive change, helping to turn the tide against the recruitment of children, killing and maiming of children, and sexual violence against children across Myanmar’s conflict-affected areas.
Geneva Call respects the principles of neutrality and impartiality in its work, and strictly limits itself to increase compliance with humanitarian norms by armed non-State actors in order to ensure a greater respect for the civilian populations. The Deed of Commitment is a formal humanitarian commitment that armed non-State actors (ANSA) sign to ensure respect for humanitarian norms. The signature of this commitment does not give any political or legal recognition to these actors.
Following years of humanitarian engagement by Geneva Call and RCSS/SSA on child protection activities, the signing of thisDeed of Commitmentopens a door to sustained and strategic support for children in Shan State and the RCSS/SSA remains engaged in dialogue with Geneva Call on other humanitarian issues.
A signatory to the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, RCSS/SSA is engaged in the current Myanmar peace process and is militarily active in Shan State, which borders China, Laos and Thailand in eastern Myanmar. In recent years, RCSS/SSA has been involved in clashes with the Myanmar Tatmadaw and with other armed non-State actors operating in Shan State. Clashes have caused displacement of communities and have greatly affected civilians, particularly women and children.

Title: Landmine Use Must Be Stopped in Myanmar’s Armed Conflict - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG 20 December 2019
It was painful to hear that Daw Aye Ngwe, mother of three children, was injured in the leg last week when a landmine exploded in her tea plantation in Namhsan Township, northern Shan State.
None of her family members could take care of her in the hospital as her three children are young and her husband had to take care of them.
Daw Aye Ngwe is one of many internally displaced people (IDPs) in northern Shan State. She left her village in Namhsan with her family on Nov. 16 because the Myanmar military and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) were fighting in the village, according to the Ta’ang Women Organization (TWO), a civil society organization promoting human rights and the rights of women.
Her family returned to the village on Dec. 12. She was hit by the landmine when she visited her tea plantation just two days after she came back to her village, on Dec. 14.
TWO reported that a man, U Hla Aung, was also hit by a landmine on the same day as Daw Aye Nge. Both of them were in the same township, though in different villages.
We often hear about local people being injured or killed by landmines in northern Shan State. Last month, a German tourist was even killed by a landmine in Hsipaw Township while driving a motorbike.
UNICEF has been working with the Landmine Monitor, an international civil society group, to conduct research on the impacts of landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) in Myanmar. In 2017, they recorded 176 landmine casualties in Myanmar, increasing to 278 in 2018. From January to September this year, there have been 168 landmine casualties in only three states: Shan, Rakhine and Kachin.
Shan State has the highest number of casualties from landmines, according to UNICEF. This year, there have been reports of 19 people killed in Shan State and 59 others injured. Rakhine has the second-highest number of casualties, with 13 people killed and 27 wounded. Kachin State ranks third: six people have been killed and 24 have been wounded.
U Win Naing Tun, the director-general of Myanmar’s Rehabilitation Department, told a mine action workshop in Naypyitaw on Oct. 30 that over 40 people have been killed and more than 160 injured by landmines in 2019.
Armed groups use landmines because they’re cheap—the groups don’t have to spend money on shooting their enemies. But ideas like this are causing many local people to be hurt and killed.
When I reported from the frontlines of the conflict in Shan State in 2017, I found that the Myanmar army used antipersonnel mines in fighting with the TNLA—just a day before I was arrested by the army. When the Myanmar military withdrew their troops from the area, members of the TNLA found those antipersonnel mines in the area where the two sides had fought.
According to the 2018 Landmine Monitor report, the Myanmar military is the only government army in the world that is still using antipersonnel mines. The Landmine Monitor has been recording the use of landmines in Myanmar since 1999.
While conducting interviews for this article, local residents in northern Shan reported that the TNLA has also used landmines in attempts to target the Myanmar army. But local residents have also been hit by these mines. When asked whether they use landmines on the frontline, all sides of the conflict deny it.
Casualties from landmines have increased this month in Kyaukme and Namhsan townships, according to local sources. Some civilians have been killed and others wounded as landmines continue to hit civilians, and not soldiers.
Mai Ah Bam is a volunteer working with local rescue group Ong Tamauk to respond to landmine incidents in the area. He told The Irrawaddy that his group has helped respond to six landmine casualties already in December—two people killed and four wounded in Kyaukme Township.
There is still ongoing fighting between the Myanmar military and the TNLA in Kyaukme and Namhsan townships. Fighting has also broken out between the TNLA and rival ethnic armed group the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS).
Most local people in the area are farmers, many working on tea plantations. Tea is the main local business: if they are unable to go to the plantations, they can’t work and they can’t eat. Now when they go to the plantations, they are afraid of the landmines but they have no other option but to work.
Civilians need protection. There are several NGOs based in northern Shan State, lending their voices to local people, but they don’t dare point out who is planting landmines. It isn’t safe to name names. As a result, local people don’t know where to turn for help to stop armed groups from using landmines.
Landmines are most commonly found in areas where armed groups have fought each other. Local people leave their villages when fighting breaks out nearby. When they come back, they step on the landmines left by the armed groups.
Armed conflict in northern Shan State won’t end soon. But leaders from armed groups should consider the civilians in the area—those who are not their enemies. These are the people bearing the cost of the conflict: they have lost limbs and become disabled for their whole lives.
The use of landmines and killing or maiming of civilians are human rights abuses. The armed groups that engage in these acts should be punished, if they have committed rights abuses. All armed groups, including the Myanmar military, must respect the UN Mine Ban Treaty, whether or not Myanmar as a country has signed it.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (24 - 30 November 2019) - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar+ 3 more
In Southeast Asia, key developments last week included: clashes between the Myanmar military and two signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement; separatist violence in Thailand and Indonesia; and continued clashes between state forces and Islamist armed groups in the Philippines.
InMyanmar, protests in support of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi were held in Yangon and Monywa regions. The protests come as the State Counsellor prepares to represent Myanmar in a case brought by Gambia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for violation of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Notably, the case has led several ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) to announce they either support the government in defending the country against the charges or that they support the efforts to bring the case to the ICJ (Irrawaddy, 2 December 2019).
In addition to the ongoing fighting in Rakhine and Shan states, clashes between the Myanmar military and two signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement were reported last week. In Shan state, the military and the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S) clashed in Namtu township. In Mon state, the military, along with the Karen Border Guard Force, clashed with the New Mon State Party/Mon National Liberation Army (NMSP/MNLA) near Three Pagodas Pass, sending hundreds of villagers across the border into Thailand. This is the first clash between the military and the NMSP/MNLA in many years.
Separatist violence was reported in **Thailand **andIndonesia. Ahead of 1 December, a day marked by West Papuans as their “Independence Day,” the separatist West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) attacked a vehicle owned by a mining company in the Freeport mine area. While President Joko Widodo has recently signaled a willingness to meet with the separatist group (Reuters, 1 October 2019), disorder in the region has risen this year as West Papuans continue to face discrimination. Meanwhile, in Thailand, suspected separatists detonated a bomb in Narathiwat province. The violence comes as the new chief negotiator for peace talks with the separatists held a press conference in which he spoke of his plan for addressing the ongoing violence in the deep south (Benar News, 3 December 2019).
In thePhilippines, battles between state forces and Islamist armed groups continued in the southern part of the country. The week prior, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) had attacked a leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). BIFF is a splinter group of the MILF. As part of a 2014 peace agreement, the MILF has been in the process of decommissioning weapons and often aids the military in its fight against Islamist armed groups in the Bangsamoro region.

Title: Hà Nội: Lập công ty “ma” để bán thuốc chữa ung thư giả | VOV.VN
Cơ quan Cảnh sát điều tra (PC46 - Công an TP Hà Nội) vừa khởi tố vụ án, khởi tố bị can, thực hiện lệnh bắt tạm giam Nguyễn Công Doanh (SN 1981, trú tại Hoàng Mai, Hà Nội) về hành vi buôn bán hàng giả.
Nguyễn Công Doanh được xác định là đối tượng buôn bán các loại thuốc điều trị ung thư, thực phẩm chức năng hỗ trợ điều trị ung thư không có nguồn gốc, dán nhãn Vidatox làm giả thuốc xịn.

Tiếp đó, Doanh nhập lậu thuốc giả từ nước ngoài về, đóng hộp, dán nhãn và cả tem chống hàng giả “dỏm” rồi phân phối cho các nhà thuốc trên địa bàn Hà Nội và các tỉnh lân cận. Các loại tem chống hàng giả được làm giả một cách tinh vi, nhìn bằng mắt thường khó có thể phát hiện được.
Thời điểm bắt giữ Doanh, cảnh sát phát hiện, thu giữ gần 20 hộp thuốc giả Doanh cất giấu trong cốp xe.
Khám xét nơi ở của Doanh, cơ quan công an thu giữ hàng trăm vỏ hộp cùng các loại thuốc điều trị ung thư, thực phẩm chức năng hỗ trợ điều trị ung thư dán nhãn Vidatox. Đây là một thương hiệu thuốc nổi tiếng của Cuba, được chiết xuất từ nọc độc bọ cạp xanh, có tác dụng giảm đau, phục hồi sức khỏe cho các bệnh nhân ung thư.
Qua giám định, cơ quan công an xác định, toàn bộ lô hàng thu giữ của Doanh đều là hàng giả.
Đáng chú ý, Doanh còn làm giả các loại thuốc chưa được Bộ Y tế cấp phép sử dụng tại Việt Nam như thuốc Vidatox 30CH.
Vụ án đang tiếp tục được làm rõ./.
