They will take place this week and are the result of a series of informal meetings. The government asked each of the eight organizations to form a delegation. Groups opposed to the ceasefire also participate. Aung San Suu Kyi intends to end decades of conflicts that have hampered the transition to a democratic federal union.
Naypyidaw (AsiaNews / Agencies) - For the first time, the Burmese government has invited eight ethnic groups that have not signed theNational Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)to the peace talks: It was announced last week by rebel organizations that received the convocation for the negotiations , which will open on March 21st.
These are theUnited Wa State Party(Uwsp), theKachin Independence Organization(Kio), theMongla’s Eastern Shan State Peace and Solidarity Committee(Psc), theShan State Progressive Party(Sspp), theKokang’s Myanmar National Truth and Justice Party(Mntjp), thePalaung State Liberation Front(Pslf), theUnited League of Arakan(Ula) and theKarenni National Progressive Party(Knpp).
On March 22nd, a team of Tatmadaw negotiators (the Burmese army) will meet each of the political groups in separate meetings, an expression of their respective armed groups. The government has asked each of the organizations to form a delegation headed by a leader and an exponent of the armed wing.
The military will discuss the unilateral ceasefire with the rebels declared last December in five of their regional commands, in order to restart the peace process. The truce will last until April. It excludes the Western Command, where government troops are engaged inarmed clashes with the Arakan Army(Aa), in the western state of Rakhine. TheTatmadawis also conducting operations in the north of Shan State, against theKachin Independence Army(Kia) and theShan State Army(Ssa) [militiamen of Kio and Sspp].
The talks will take place this week and are the result of a series of informal meetings, which the Nayipyidaw Peace Commission held with Kio, Pslf, Mntjp and Ula in the Chinese province of Yunnan on February 25 and with Knpp in Chiang Mai, in Thailand, March 10.
Led by theNational League for Democracy(NLD) - Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party -, the government chaired periodic peace conferences, in an attempt to involve the ethnic armed organizations (Eao) that did not sign the NCA. The Agreement is a prerequisite for sitting at the table of thePanglong Peace Conferenceof the 21st century and the Union Peace Conference. Through these initiatives, the administration hopes to put an end to decades of conflicts that have hindered the country's transition to a democratic federal union.

Title: Contain the Increasing Lethality of Arakan Army Before It Gets More Lethal | Ajit Kumar Singh | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam


By Ajit Kumar Singh
March 13, 2019
On March 10, 2019, Arakan Army (AA)
insurgents attacked a boat, carrying 14 policemen, at Kardi Creek in Yathedaung
Township in the Rakhine State. Though the police boat sank, 13 of the policemen
on board managed to return to safety. One policeman was reported injured and
missing.
On March 9, 2019, AA insurgents attacked
the Yotayoke Police Outpost in Ponnagyun Township of Rakhine State killing nine
policemen. One policeman was reported missing after the attack. Colonel Win Zaw
Oo, head of the Tatmadaw’s (military’s) Western Region Command, noted, “We
believe the AA intends to continue attacking smaller police outposts that have
fewer personnel.” He disclosed, further, that the officers at the outpost were
believed to have been outnumbered 10 to 1 in the surprise attack.
Significantly, AA insurgents had killed 13 policemen in a series of attacks on
four police outposts in Rakhine on January 4, 2019, Myanmar's Independence Day.
On February 27, 2019, AA insurgents carried
out a landmine explosion targeting four vehicles - three cars belonging to the
Myanmar Police Force and one Sedan (Toyota Mark II, confiscated from criminals)
– near Mile Post 165 on the Yangon-Sittway Road between Pan Nilar Village and
Kyan Khin Village in Rakhine. Each of the four vehicles had a single police
driver on board. Two police drivers were killed while the remaining two were
injured in the attack.
The Myanmar military on January 18, 2019,
had disclosed that the military clashed with the Arakan Army 15 times in 2015,
26 times in 2016, 56 times in 2017 and 61 times in 2018, while the rebels also
planted some mines. The military also said there were at least eight armed
encounters in 2019.
The Arakan Army, founded in 2009 by a few
ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, has grown in strength to an estimated membership of
7,000. Security analyst David Scott Mathieson observes, “the Arakan Army has
expanded to a force of [several thousand] soldiers” and “the scale and
geographic reach of their activities have steadily grown." Apart from the
incidents confirmed by the Myanmar Government, AA insurgents have claimed
several other major attacks on security establishments. For instance, on March
10, 2019, AA announced that it occupied a temporary tactical command base and
‘arrested’ 11 ‘prisoners of war’ (troopers) during a clash with Myanmar Army
troops near Buthidaung Township in Rakhine. Also, AA insurgents are issuing
statements threatening Security Forces (SFs) with dire consequences. For
instance, a February 8, 2019, statement warned,
… We urge the police to steer away from the
battlegrounds, shifting their attention to protection of civilians… for those
police who cooperate with the Burmese Army and the Burmese army that wears the
police uniform, we should take them all as our opponents and will fight our
defensive wars against them…
Indeed, according to the United League of
Arakan (ULA), the political wing of the Arakan Army, founded in 2009, the
stated goal of ULA and the AA is to
...struggle in line with the political and
military means the Arakanese National Liberation, National Equality, the right
of self-determination, the right to dispose of the Arakanese natural resources
and the right to take the Arakanese own destiny in their hands, the rights of
the Arakanese IDPs and the right to regain our national losses.
At a time when the Myanmar Government was
focusing all its attention on its declared primary security threat, the Arakan
Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Rohingya Muslim insurgent group, the Arakan
Army has intensified its violent activities in Myanmar. It was expected from
Nay Pyi Taw to take stringent measures against theincreasing menace of AA insurgents’.
On January 19, 2019, the Myanmar military
announced that Arakan Army had been classified as a terrorist organisation. It
also disclosed that Aung San Suu Kyi, State Counsellor of Myanmar, observed,
“the Arakan Army is just a terrorist group” and had “instructed us to defeat
them effectively, quickly and clearly”.
SF operations can now be expected to
intensify, to contain the increasing lethality of this terror formation before
it gets more lethal and create further chaos in the already unstable Rakhine
region which has witnessed a displacement of over 800,000 of its population
since 2016.

As per the intelligence report, some camps are situated very close to Rohingya refugee camps in Cox Bazar in Bangladesh.
Sumit Kumar Singh
Updated :Mar 26, 2019, 05:55 AM IST
India has found Arkan Rohingiya Salvation Army (ARSA) has set up new bases at Myanmar and Bangladesh where cadre are being trained to launch massive attacks on security forces and big infrastructural projects. As per the intelligence report, some camps are situated very close to Rohingya refugee camps in Cox Bazar in Bangladesh. Their target are infrastructural projects between India and Myanmar.
As per the report, ARSA is recruiting people from Rohingya refugees camps in Bangladesh and are brainwashing and radicalising them and then giving them weapons to fight against security forces. Myanmar government too has alleged that ARSA has three training camps inside Bangladesh and many Rohingiya are joining them.
Contrary to it, Bangladesh denied existence of any such camps on their soil and demanded support from international community to help them to rehabilitate them.
Recently Indian Army carried out a mega operation to eliminate threats posed by insurgents along the Indo-Myanmar border.
Joint operations between the Indian and Myanmar armies were carried out from February 17 and March 2 to thwart a threat to a mega infrastructure project vital for the Northeast.
The Indian Army carried out a major operation on the eastern front targeting the Arakan Army, which is designated as a terrorist group by Myanmar. According to assessments, the mega Kaladan Project was under threat from the Arakan Army. The Kaladan Project is a transit project will connect Kolkata to Sitwe port in Myanmar.
The project will finally end up linking Mizoram and is a new gateway to the landlocked Northeast. The project will reduce the distance from Kolkata to Mizoram by nearly a thousand kilometres and bring down the travel time by at least four days.
With intelligence assessments point to threats to the Kaladan Project, the Indian Army planned a mission to flush out insurgent groups that had set up bases south of Mizoram in Myanmar.
It was found that the Arakan Army is also well trained in setting up Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) making the threat to the project and it workers even greater. "This was a serious concern both for India and Myanmar," a source said.
The source also said that in January this year, six Myanmar border guards were injured when 10 ARSA ambushed a border guard post near Wet Kyein village in Maungdaw township in the north of the state.

Title: How Indian media spread outright misinformation about a ‘massive surgical strike’ against ‘Rohingya insurgents’ – Firstpost
Most media reports were rife with unverified facts that not only jumped the gun on the military operation, but also ended up slandering the Rohingya Muslim community.
Last week, asIndia Todayreported “a mega operation (by the Indian army) to eliminate threats posed by insurgents along the Indo-Myanmar border”, a section of the Indian media went on a misinformation tizzy.
According to the report byIndia Todaycorrespondent Abhishek Bhalla, published on 15 March, the Indian and Myanmar armies carried out a “joint operation” between 17 February and 2 March to destroy bases of the Arakan Army (AA), a Myanmar-based insurgent group. Citing a “senior officer in the security establishment”, the report said that most of these bases were set up in “areas adjoining the Lawngtala district of Mizoram”. It further stated that the AA posed a threat to “the mega Kaladan Project”.
BREAKING@IndiaToday: Big infra project vital for North East connecting Kolkata to Mizoram via Sitwe port in Myanmar under threat. How Indian Army thwarted the danger to#KaladanProjectin a 2 week operation when focus was on responding to Pak post Pulwama More updates coming uppic.twitter.com/UgEzxCoHIw
Simultaneously, several other media outlets carried the news about the so-called “surgical strike 3.0” in various forms and under different headlines. However, most of these were rife with either outright misinformation or unverified facts that not only jumped the gun on the military operation, but also ended up slandering the stateless Rohingya Muslim community.
Non-existent Rohingya group
For instance, WION carried the news under the headline “Joint India, Myanmar operation targets Rohingya insurgents and Naga terror groups”, stating that “in a two-week-long joint operation by India and Myanmar against the Rohingya insurgent groups Arakan Army and Naga terror group NSCN(K), the countries launched a massive crackdown destroying several camps of the terror organisations.”
A similar report was carried byIndia News. Certain right-wing portals too picked up the news and gave it a Rohingya spin.
Contrary to what the above reports claim, the Arakan Army is not a “Rohingya insurgent” group. It is an ethnic Rakhine armed group that is fighting for the self-determination of Rakhine state. The outfit, proscribed by the Myanmar government as a “terrorist organisation” after an attack on border police outposts on 4 January, claims to represent the Rakhine Buddhist majority in Rakhine state. In fact, the Rohingya Muslim minority and the Rakhine Buddhists share a tense relationship.
In the same vein, a report inNewsXfirst rightly identifies the Arakan Army as a “Rakhine insurgent group”, but then goes on to discuss the motives of the “Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA)”. The ARSA is a Rohingya insurgent group and is not associated with the Arakan Army in any way.
While news media routinely tends to peddle misinformation on critical military matters, what is perhaps most startling is similar misreporting by former army generals. In a 17 March commentary onThe Times of India, former Commander of Indian Army’s Western Command,Lt Gen KJ Singh, wrote:
“AA and Rohingya Army camps had sprung all along Indo-Myanmar border, threatening flagship Kaladan, multi-mode project.”
The author appears to have confused, like the rest, the Rohingya-led Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) with the ethnic Rakhine-led Arakan Army. So far, there is no credible evidence to suggest that ARSA has set up camps “all along the Indo-Myanmar border” or threatened the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMMTTP).
While the error is understandable, it is not excusable, since it puts the Rohingya Muslim community in bad light in front of the Indian audience. Rohingya refugees in India have already faced much slandering and stereotyping from right-wing quarters who routinely label them as “terrorists”, “security threats” and “infiltrators” without any supporting evidence. Such mis-reportage only validates the communal, xenophobic diatribes.
What ‘surgical strike’?
As far as the operation and the reason behind it are concerned, most of the reportage glossed over nuances and facts, instead relying on attention-grabbing tropes like “surgical strike” and “massive operation”. None of the mainstream media reports actually bothered to go beyond their “sources” or the first exclusive report byIndia Todayto find out what the Arakan Army really seeks and what the recent developments mean in the local context.
First, the recent operations can hardly be classified as “mega strikes” or “surgical strikes” as several Indian news media outlets announced. According to Guwahati-based senior journalist-author, Rajeev Bhattacharyya, who is also a close watcher of the India-Myanmar border region:
“There was no surgical strike by the Indian army in Myanmar. There was deployment of a few companies by the army along the border in south Mizoram to check the entry of rebels and refugees into the state, which has happened earlier. The deployment was done since the presence of Assam Rifles is thin in Mizoram as compared to the other states in India’s North East.”
Further, in a recent report inThe Diplomat, Bhattacharyya quoted the superintendent of police of Lawngtlai district in Mizoram (where most of the operations allegedly happened), Amit Goel, as saying that no Arakan Army cadres were arrested or convicted in the recent operations. According to Goel, ten of them were held last year.
It is clear that the deployment’s primary strategic objective was to prevent Arakan Army rebels from fleeing across the border into Mizoram, and in the process, inflict some damage to its remote positions along the border. More importantly, the Indian Army did not cross the border, as also stated by some of the better-informed reports in the Indian media.
Further, according to theIndia Todayreport (and reiterated by others), the Indian Army operation was undertaken to neutralise the threat that the Arakan Army posed to the KMMTTP — an India-led connectivity project that aims to connect Kolkata port with Sittwe port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state via India’s North East.
While the Arakan Army, by its very presence in and around Chin state’s Paletwa Township (which has a KMMTTP-linked inland river terminal), might pose a security threat to the Indian project’s infrastructure in the long term, there is little indication of the outfit posing any immediate and imminent threat to Indian interests in Myanmar.
“It is difficult to say at the moment if the Arakan Army would target the Kaladan project. Arakan Army has been demanding greater autonomy like the other outfits in Myanmar and it opposes the exploitation of the region’s resources by the government. Therefore, it is quite natural that this group would expect benefits from the Kaladan project to trickle down to the local populace,” Bhattacharyya told this author.
Clearly, the threat from Arakan Army to KMMTTP is a long-term potentiality, and not impending. What then was the actual reason behind the Indian army operations?
Returning a favour
According to senior journalists reporting from the region, India was simply returning a favour to Myanmar. Bhattacharyya in his recent report quoted an official as saying:
“The Myanmar army has initiated action against the Indian insurgent groups from Assam and Manipur, two other states of India’s North East, operating from Taga. As a quid pro quo, the Indian army has committed that all efforts would be made to check the entry of Arakan Army rebels into Mizoram.”
Further, one senior Indian army officer was quoted in aNortheast Nowreport by senior journalist, Subir Bhaumik, as saying that the operation was “reciprocal” to Myanmar’s earlier takeover of Naga camps in its territory.
This makes more sense than the KMMTTP theory. Earlier this year, the Myanmar army peacefully took over the main camps of the Myanmar-based Naga insurgent outfit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K), close to the India-Myanmar border in Sagaing Division’s Taga.
The Indian government had been long requesting its Myanmar counterpart to act against the NSCN-K, which was behind an attack on an Indian army convoy in 2015 in Manipur. So, when the Myanmar army successfully took over the outfit’s camps, New Delhi’s diplomatic efforts were vindicated. What’s more, the takeover was preceded by a split in the NSCN-K, allegedly engineered by the Myanmar government, which saw the Indian Nagas in the outfit return to India and join the New Delhi-led peace process.
Further, the Arakan Army’s primary strategic target is the Myanmar military, and not the Indian Army. So, it is understandable why the former would want India to deny safe havens or exit points to the rebels. Clearly, the Mizoram operations benefited Myanmar more than India. None of the other Indian media outlets highlighted these crucial bits.
Strangely, even the firstIndia Todayreport quotes a “security officer” as saying that India and Myanmar governments have signed a give-and-take deal, but states that the NSCN-K takeover happened after the Indian army operations against Arakan Army in Mizoram. This cannot be true as the latter commenced only on 17 February (according to the same report), and the Naga takeover happened in late January.
Moreover, according to Bhattacharyya, the Indian army operation “has offended not only the (Mizoram) state government but a large section of civil society organisations in the border state.” Some human rights violations were also reported during the deployment, which involved forcibly displacing the locals. These details found no mention in the Indian mainstream media, which remains fervently obsessed with hyperboles and falsities.
With general elections approaching in India, the sound of another “surgical strike” to “wipe out” terror helps boost Prime Minister Narendra’s Modi image as a strong leader. But, between the overreaching lines and the exaggerated headlines, hide the finer details that tell a much more sober story.

Title: Myanmar: Invest here, please. Don’t mind the insurgents. - The World from PRX
Myanmar’s state councilor, Aung San Suu Kyi, delivers a speech at the Rakhine State Investment Fair at Ngapali beach in Thandwe, Rakhine, Myanmar, Feb. 22, 2019.
Aung San Suu Kyi — Myanmar’s most famous person, probably ever — recently mounted a podium and made an exceptionally difficult pitch.
Please, shetold a roomfulof foreign investors. Invest in Rakhine.
Rakhine is a coastal area, roughly the size of Switzerland, which stretches along Myanmar’s western coastline. It’s jungly, humid and prone to frequent power outages. The average person living in Rakhine pulls in only$500per year, an amount lower than mostestimatesfor North Korea.
Related:A climate migration crisis is escalating in Bangladesh
But that’s hardly the sole reason Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation’s state councilor and political leader, is struggling to lure global investment to Rakhine. It doesn’t help her case that The New York Times mentions Rakhine alongside Sarajevo and Darfur, calling it a“global byword for ethnic cleansing.”
Rakhine is notorious as the homeland of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority suffering bothapartheid campsandmilitary-led purgesthat have driven hundreds of thousands into neighboring Bangladesh, where most refugees live in crowded camps.
And then there are the rebels.
Rakhine is also the homeland of the Arakan people, a largely Buddhist ethnicity. Though most people in the area are Arakan, they’re a minority compared to the nation’s largest ethnic group, the Burmese.
Among the Arakan are revolutionaries fed up with government misrule and waging an insurgency to seize control of the region.
Related:A spoken word poet in Myanmar speaks out against hate and injustice
In recent months, this rebellion has revved up. The roughly 7,000-strong Arakan Army has stagedroadside bomb attacksand gunned down police — all while taunting officials on social media.
One typical video features a female rebel firing an assault rifle and shouting that she is “coming to take our country back!”
Images of insurgents, UN reports of ethnic cleansing — this is exactly the sort of thing that tends to pop up when Googling the word “Rakhine.” But Aung San Suu Kyi, in a late February speech at a foreign investors’ summit in Rakhine, suggested these horrors are blown out of proportion.
“For too long, the international community’s attention has been focused narrowly on negative aspects … rather than on the panoramic picture that shows the immense potential of this state for peace and prosperity.”
“For too long, the international community’s attention has been focused narrowly on negative aspects … rather than on the panoramic picture,” she said, “that shows the immense potential of this state for peace and prosperity.”
The region, she said, is simply a “latecomer to the development scene” that is nevertheless “brimming with opportunities and warm and friendly people, all eager to be a part of the development adventure.”
Aung San Suu Kyi touts the region’s pristine beach zone as “scintillating” with tourist potential. She highlights the allure of Mrauk U, a series of grand, Buddhist temples built by the Arakan people more than five centuries ago.
“It is a gem,” she said, “that has yet to be revealed to the world.”
Those beaches are located more than 200 miles from the fighting and appear quite safe.
As for the temples? They’re so close to the fighting that, as two British tourists walked through the ruins recently, they were able to record distant sounds of staccato gunfire.
Despite all of this chaos, Myanmar’s government claims to have secured “expressions of interest” towardnearly $5 billionworth of investments in Rakhine. But a huge portion of that will flow into a sector that dominates the region’s economy: offshore natural gas.
Gas is what compels outsiders — firms from China and South Korea as well as America’s Chevron — to invest in drills or pipelines off Rakhine’s shoreline. Little of this extracted wealth, however, ends up funding the schools or clinics that locals so desperately need.
“The local people regard offshore gas as a curse, not a blessing.”
“The local people regard offshore gas as a curse, not a blessing,” said Vicky Bowman, formerly a British ambassador to Myanmar and now the head of an organization called the Centre for Responsible Business.
These feelings are tapped by the rebels whoproclaim that“the invading Burmese have brought only increasing military oppression, cultural destruction and exploitation to the Arakan people.”
The insurgents’ commander — a bespectacled, 40-year-old named Maj. Gen. Twan Mrat Naing — has explicitly spoken of reviving Arakan greatness, a past era exemplified by those ancient temples. This lost kingdom of Arakan was conquered by a Burmese-run dynasty in the late 1700s and, fewer than 50 years later, overrun by the British Empire.
“Our Arakan kingdom was very wealthy … but under Burmese rule,” he said, “we became very poor, and lost everything we had.”
Myanmar’s government will insist it wants to uplift the Rakhine people by urging wealthy foreigners to open resorts, clothing factories and shrimp farms in Rakhine. But Bowman said investors inevitably wonder why they’d pour money into a zone prone to unrest rather than a more secure part of Myanmar — or a more peaceful country in the region.
“The people who are looking to invest in Rakhine are doing it because … they have no choice,” she said. “If they want to be investing in gas in Myanmar, that’s the place to be.”
Warfare between security forces and Arakan insurgents is unlikely to reach the gas rigs. They’re separated from the current fighting by more than 100 miles of rough terrain and bumpy roads.
But it will almost certainly derail Aung San Suu Kyi’s hopes of transforming Mrauk U — the seat of the old Arakan kingdom — into a major tourist site. Though hard to verify, variousclips on Twitterappear to show bullet marks on the ruins and locals huddling nearby, seeking refuge from the violence.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the income of the average person living in Rakhine.

Title: While India was glued to Balakot airstrike, army carried out mega strikes along Myanmar border - India Today
Listen to Story
While the world -- and India -- focused on Pulwama terror attack and the Balakot airstrike carried out in its aftermath, the Indian Army carried out a mega operation to eliminate threats posed by insurgents along the Indo-Myanmar border.Joint operations between the Indian and Myanmar armies were carried out from February 17 and March 2 to thwart a threat to a mega infrastructure project vital for the Northeast. The threat was from an insurgent group in Myanmar.
The operation was carried out when the world was focused on the Indian Air Force airstrike in Pakistan's Balakot. The airstrike targeted Jaish-e-Mohammed's largest terror camp and was seen as a response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force jawans were martyred.
While the focus in India and outside remained on the western border, the Indian Army silently carried out a major operation on the eastern front targeting the so-called Arakan Army, an insurgent group reportedly being raised by the Kachin Independence Army, which is designated as a terrorist group by Myanmar.
According to assessments, the mega Kaladan Project was under threat from the Arakan Army. The Kaladan Project is a transit project will connect Kolkata to Sitwe port in Myanmar.
The project will finally end up linking Mizoram and will be a new gateway to the landlocked Northeast. The project will reduce the distance from Kolkata to Mizoram by nearly a thousand kilometres and bring down the travel time by at least four days. (Notably, China has also been carrying out development projects at Kyaukpyu port near Sitwe.)
With intelligence assessments point to threats to the Kaladan Project, the Indian Army planned a mission to flush out insurgent groups that had set up bases south of Mizoram in Myanmar.Large scale joint operations were launched by the Indian and Myanmar armies. The first phase targeted newly constructed camps bordering Mizoram. Part two targeted the deadly Naga group, NSCN (K); its their camps were destroyed up north around 1000 kms away bordering Arunachal Pradesh.The operations -- first of their kind in terms of deployment and covering areas all along the India-Myanmar border -- went on for two weeks and ended on March 2.The deployment for the operation included Special Forces of the Indian Army, Assam Rifles and other infantry units. Helicopters, drones and other surveillance equipment were also used during the operations to make an accurate assessment of movement of the insurgent groups and their camps."In the last two years the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) that trains the Arakan Army in the Kachin State of Myanmar adjoining China had readied around 3000 cadres that moved to the South closing in on areas adjoining the Lawngtala district of Mizoram," said a senior officer in the security establishment.These were exactly the areas that cut through the proposed Kaladan Project that will link Sitwe in Myanmar to Mizoram, sources said.The Arakan Army is also well trained in setting up Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) making the threat to the project and it workers even greater. "This was a serious concern both for India and Myanmar," a source said.The Arakan Army Headquarters are in Laiza also in the Kachin state bordering China falling close to the sensitive India-China-Myanmar trijunction.The beginnings of the Arakan Army also go back to Kachin state bordering China and not the Arakan region that falls in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.It's predominantly a Buddhist insurgent group active in Myanmar."A deal was cut out that after the action adjoining Mizoram the Myanmar army will hit the insurgent camps of other groups that have been targeting India. This resulted in totally wiping out of Taga, the HQ of NSCN (K). Based on specific inputs provided by us the Myanmar Army hit these camps and is now occupying them," said a security officer.At least a dozen camps have been completely destroyed here, sources said.The planning for the joint operations started around 2 months back, sources said.The Arakan Army along with KIA is part of the coalition of insurgent groups called the Northern Alliance said be supported by China.

Title: India-Myanmar joint operation destroys militant camps on eastern border | India News - The Indian Express
Days after the airstrike in Pakistan’s Balakot, Indian forces in coordination with Myanmar Army conducted a joint operation and claimed to have wiped out militant camps on the eastern border. The action, officials said, averted a possible threat to the ambitious Kaladan transit and transport project considered key for improving the connectivity in the Northeast, officials confirmed.
Government sources said the coordinated operation started on February 17 and was completed on March 2 where several camps of Arakan Army on the Indo-Myanmar border were razed. The officials, however, refrained from giving the number of casualties of militants in the operations.
After the joint operation, media reports in the Northeast claimed that Myanmar Army has taken more than a dozen leaders of the NSCN-K faction into custody after the operation at their base at Taga in Sagaing Division of Myanmar last month, indicating close cooperation between the security forces of the two countries. The Naga insurgent group, responsible for attacks on the Indian Army, is banned in India.
Indian agencies claim that some members of the Arakan Army started moving towards south Myanmar despite the fact that their bases are mostly towards the north of the country.
According to the reports, Arakan Army members managed to set up at least 8-10 camps across the international border with India in the Rakhine state of Myanmar, starting in 2017. Most of the camps were located along the Mizoram-Myanmar border. Ahead of the coordinated operation, Indian and Myanmar armies deployed additional troops along the international border, officials added.
Apart from personnel of the Assam Rifles, primarily responsible for guarding the international border with Myanmar, personnel from the Indian Army, including special forces, were deployed along with surveillance equipment.
The officials, however, maintained that Indian forces did not cross the border and only extended logistic support to Myanmar Army. During the raids, which lasted for over two weeks, all the camps and the makeshift arrangements of Arakan Army were completely destroyed, officials claimed.
While the Indian security establishment said the real motive of Arakan Army movement towards Indian side is unclear, it is possible that the presence of insurgents posed a serious security threat to the Kaladan project.

Title: Fighting in Shan State displaces 200 Villagers - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Fresh fighting that erupted Wednesday between Myanmar forces and the Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP)/Shan State Army-North and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) in northern Shan state’s Namtu township has displaced more than 200 villagers, RFA reported.
Government soldiers clashed with an alliance of troops from the SSPP and TNLA between the township’s Mong Mu and San Kha villages, villagers said.
Residents reported that a military helicopter fired in the area between the two villages and that gunfire from the Myanmar Army’s Namtu-based troops continued until noon.
Nearly 45,000 people have been temporarily displaced by fighting in 21 townships in northern Shan and neighbouring Kachin states since January 2018, according to an update issued this February by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Title: UNODC-supported Alternative Development Coffee from Myanmar launched in French Parliament
PARIS, 22 March 2019 - In a pivotal moment for Myanmar's burgeoning specialty coffee industry, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and French coffee company Malongo today launched a new line of high-quality coffee, Shan Mountain Coffee, in the French Parliament.
The first tasting and presentation of Shan Mountain Coffee took place at the Presidential Hall of the Parliament in presence of the President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand and dozens of other prominent guests. At the same time, the sales of Shan Mountain Coffee opened in Malongo stores in Paris and Nice.
The Shan Mountain Coffee is ethically sourced in conflict-ridden Shan State in eastern Myanmar. Shan State produces nearly 90 per cent of opium cultivated in Myanmar, the second largest opium exporter in the world (after Afghanistan).
The Shan Mountain Coffee is grown by a UNODC-supported Green Gold Cooperative formed by almost 1,000 farmers in Shan State who used to cultivate opium poppy.  The strategic partnership between Malongo, the Green Gold Cooperative and UNODC is a key to bringing peace, prosperity and environmental sustainability to Shan State which is one of the top opium poppy cultivation areas in the world.
"UNODC is proud to have been part of this exciting initiative that developed a brand new premium coffee product as a means for reducing opium production in Myanmar," said Troels Vester, UNODC Country Manager in Myanmar. "Judging by its success here in French Parliament, the Shan Mountain Coffee is now set to make it in France and encourage others in Myanmar to switch from opium to growing alternatives crops."
The emergence of Myanmar as a coffee producer is supported by UNODC's Alternative Development Programme, co-financed by two main donors, Finland and Germany, and with the additional support of Switzerland, that is giving resources directly to the Cooperative.
The programme's objective to develop sustainable livelihood alternatives for opium growing communities has enabled participating farmers to independently cultivate, refine and commercialize high quality coffee that can be exported to one of the most competitive international markets. The establishment of the farmer-run Green Gold Cooperative ensures that these farmers will indeed see the fruits of their labour for many years to come.
"In Shan State, this programme has not only provided livelihoods and increased confidence in governance, but also promoted environmental sustainability, land tenure rights, and contributed to creating an enabling environment for peace," said Miwa Kato, Director of Operations for UNODC.  "The partnership between the Malongo Coffee company and the Green Gold Cooperative in Myanmar demonstrates how both public and private interests can merge to benefit small farmer communities," she added.
"Malongo is a private company, our involvement in such a project is not about charity or helping coffee producers, it is about business. But we want to set up another kind of business where the added value is shared between the actors of the supply chain, where producers can live with dignity from their work, where consumers are faithful and satisfied with the quality," said Jean-Pierre Blanc, Director General of Malongo Coffee Company.
Green Gold began the partnership with Malongo to bring to market alternative development coffee in 2017. Under this long-term (five year) partnership agreement, Malongo will buy up to 600 tonnes of coffee per year from more than one thousand beneficiary farmers.
Farmers cultivating illicit drug crops are usually unable to obtain sufficient income from legal activities and are among the most marginalized in society, with profits fueling protracted armed conflict in Myanmar's peripheral regions. Alternative development has been one of the most successful approaches to providing these farmers with more stable, sustainable livelihoods.
Nang San Hlaing is a beneficiary farmer from Taung Nauk village in Southern Shan State. Reflecting on her area's transition from conflict to peace, she illustrated the impact of alternative development in creating an environment of peace: "After we joined the UNODC coffee programme in 2015, Myanmar soldiers and ethnic armed groups make fewer visits to our village. We enjoy a more peaceful life now and would like to thank UNODC for working in our village and helping poor farmers to plant coffee for a sustainable income."
Women play a crucial role in this programme participating as farmers, village level committee members and representatives in the governing bodies of Green Gold. Although there have been important advances, women still face challenges as farmers and community leaders, role models and mothers. Nang Lone, ethnic Shan woman from Taunt Lan village (Loilem township) expresses her feelings related to her participation in the programme: "People may think differently about my role in my family, however I must step up for my children's future. And for my community."

Swathes of Shan state -- like many of the country's restive borderlands -- have been embroiled in conflict for decades.
ith artillery exploding around her village in Myanmar's northeast, 70-year-old Nan Nyunt fled to a monastery, one of thousands of civilians trapped between rebel groups who are fighting for influence as a China-driven economic boom looms.
"Houses were on fire and a buffalo died," she told AFP, huddled on the floor with other elderly displaced people.
She is one of several thousand forced to flee their homes -- many multiple times -- since fighting flared up in November in this normally peaceful area popular with tourists, who arrive by train from Mandalay to explore the hills.
"I'm still scared but I just want to go back home," she said.
Swathes of Shan state -- like many of the country's restive borderlands -- have been embroiled in conflict for decades.
The unrest is fiendishly complex, with a web of ethnic armed groups fighting Myanmar's military for land, resources and autonomy.
Shan is also the hub of Myanmar's multi-billion dollar drug trade.
Beijing, which already invests heavily in ports, pipelines, dams and mines across Myanmar, is now looking at scaling up projects in the border area of Shan.
Special economic zones are planned, while a high-speed rail link and expressway are expected to bisect the country, reaching the Chinese-built port of Kyaukphyu in Rakhine State on the Bay of Bengal.
The potential riches of controlling the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) is a "huge factor" behind the current clashes, said Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson.
"(It) is going to be astonishingly lucrative and they (ethnic armed groups) all want their cut," he explained.
There have been cyclical attempts by Shan rebel factions to encroach on rivals' territory, but now they are turning on each other with increased ferocity.
China is pumping investment into infrastructure schemes across the region and all the way to Europe as part of its "One Belt, One Road" project.
But Myanmar, one of Southeast Asia's least developed countries, has a complicated relationship with investment from its northern neighbour.
A Chinese-funded dam at Myitsone on the Ayeyarwady river in northern Kachin state was mothballed in 2011 after widespread protests over the environmental damage likely to be wrought while returning little to local people.
But Myanmar is now under pressure to revive the scheme.
If completed, the $3.6 billion project would flood an area twice the size of Singapore and displace thousands.
The Kyaukphyu port also riled locals fearing Myanmar debt would pay for a project beneficial to China.
It was eventually signed off in November, but scaled down to a cost of $1.3 billion.
Factional fighting
One of the rebel groups now on the offensive is the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS).
Its stronghold is in the south of Shan state, but it is eyeing territory in the north, the bastion of the Taaung National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Shan State Army (SSPP).
Meanwhile, the still-powerful military -- known as the Tatmadaw -- has declared a temporary ceasefire in Shan.
Observers believe curbing operations in Shan also helps show China that Myanmar is committed to their joint projects -- even if rebel groups continue to fight among themselves.
"The Tatmadaw can just sit back, build up its forces and watch them kill each other," said Mathieson.
Back in the monastery civilians are caught between factions warring over a bonanza they are unlikely to ever benefit from.
Young children learn a song through animal actions while the older kids chant through a Shan language lesson, hoping to be able to return home to take upcoming exams.
Most people here claim they do not know who is fighting -- forced recruitment by armed groups is common and nobody wants their family to become a target.
Tin Sein, 60, leader of the displaced community at the monastery, said they have sent letters to "both sides" imploring them to stop the violence.
"We just want to live peacefully," he said.

Its stronghold is in the south of Shan state, but it is eyeing territory in the north, the bastion of the Taaung National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Shan State Army (SSPP).
Meanwhile, the still-powerful military – known as the Tatmadaw – has declared a temporary ceasefire in Shan.
Observers believe curbing operations in Shan also helps show China that Myanmar is committed to their joint projects – even if rebel groups continue to fight among themselves.
“The Tatmadaw can just sit back, build up its forces and watch them kill each other,“ said Mathieson.
Back in the monastery civilians are caught between factions warring over a bonanza they are unlikely to ever benefit from.
Young children learn a song through animal actions while the older kids chant through a Shan language lesson, hoping to be able to return home to take upcoming exams.
Most people here claim they do not know who is fighting – forced recruitment by armed groups is common and nobody wants their family to become a target.
Tin Sein, 60, leader of the displaced community at the monastery, said they have sent letters to “both sides” imploring them to stop the violence.
“We just want to live peacefully,“ he said. —AFP

With artillery exploding around her village in Myanmar's northeast, 70-year-old Nan Nyunt fled to a monastery, one of thousands of civilians trapped between rebel groups who are fighting for influence as a China-driven economic boom looms.
"Houses were on fire and a buffalo died," she told AFP, huddled on the floor with other elderly displaced people.
She is one of several thousand forced to flee their homes -- many multiple times -- since fighting flared up in November in this normally peaceful area popular with tourists, who arrive by train from Mandalay to explore the hills.
"I'm still scared but I just want to go back home," she said.
Swathes of Shan state -- like many of the country's restive borderlands -- have been embroiled in conflict for decades.
The unrest is fiendishly complex, with a web of ethnic armed groups fighting Myanmar's military for land, resources and autonomy.
Shan is also the hub of Myanmar's multi-billion dollar drug trade.
Beijing, which already invests heavily in ports, pipelines, dams and mines across Myanmar, is now looking at scaling up projects in the border area of Shan.
Special economic zones are planned, while a high-speed rail link and expressway are expected to bisect the country, reaching the Chinese-built port of Kyaukphyu in Rakhine State on the Bay of Bengal.
The potential riches of controlling the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) is a "huge factor" behind the current clashes, said Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson.
"(It) is going to be astonishingly lucrative and they (ethnic armed groups) all want their cut," he explained.
There have been cyclical attempts by Shan rebel factions to encroach on rivals' territory, but now they are turning on each other with increased ferocity.
China is pumping investment into infrastructure schemes across the region and all the way to Europe as part of its "One Belt, One Road" project.
But Myanmar, one of Southeast Asia's least developed countries, has a complicated relationship with investment from its northern neighbour.
A Chinese-funded dam at Myitsone on the Ayeyarwady river in northern Kachin state was mothballed in 2011 after widespread protests over the environmental damage likely to be wrought while returning little to local people.
But Myanmar is now under pressure to revive the scheme.
If completed, the $3.6 billion project would flood an area twice the size of Singapore and displace thousands.
The Kyaukphyu port also riled locals fearing Myanmar debt would pay for a project beneficial to China.
It was eventually signed off in November, but scaled down to a cost of $1.3 billion.

Title:  UN report on Myanmar opium crop criticized
ForgotUsernameorPassword

Date
(MENAFN- Asia Times) The recently-released 'Myanmar Opium Survey 2018' by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) distorts reality, accuses ethnic rebels who are not involved in the drugs trade for being responsible for the scourge while turning a blind eye to official complicity in the trade.That is the basic message in a commentary published on March 5 by the Transnational Institute (TNI), a Dutch-based international research and advocacy group.The UNODC report claimed that 'in Kachin State, the highest density of poppy cultivation took place in areas under the control or influence of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).'That assertion prompted the Kachin rebels to issue a statement on February 14 pointing out that the UNODC's own map in its report showed that most opium growing areas in Kachin State were located not in areas controlled by the KIA, but a government-recognized Border Guard Force, allied with the Myanmar military.TNI states that 'there is presently no substantial opium cultivation' in rebel-held territory. The TNI has even criticized the KIA and Pat Jasan, a community-based, anti-drugs Kachin vigilante organization 'for being overly repressive towards opium farmers and people who use drugs, rather than being in any way permissive.'The TNI goes to state that the UNODC claims that the highest density of opium cultivation in northern Shan State is in 'areas under the control or influence of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army,' a Kokang guerilla army that does not control any territory, while opium is actually being grown and traded in areas that are controlled by local militias backed by the Myanmar military.After the Kachin rebels complained about the UNODC report, its Bangkok and Yangon offices issued a statement on February 27, which, however, did not address the main issue of wrongful identification of armed groups in the opium growing areas. It contained only a couple of satellite images of Kachin State and how those could be interpreted.MENAFN0603201901590000ID1098212617

Title: Terror camps on India-Myanmar border destroyed – India TV
Representational
When the nation's attention was focussed on the Balakot air strike, Indian Army in a joint operation with Myanmar Army destroyed 10 camps belonging to an insurgent group in Myanmar which had threatened the Kaladan multi-mode transit project.
Operation Sunrise was a mega task in which Arakan army, an insurgent outfit of Kachin Independent Army (KIA) backed by China, was targeted.
Sources said the camps were destroyed inside Myanmar with active support of the Indian Army in an intense operation lasting over 10 days.
The Army provided hardware and equipment to Myanmar for the operation while it mobilised massive forces on the border.
The operation was carried out on inputs that the insurgents were targeting the mega infrastructure project linking Kolkata with Sitwe in Myanmar through sea route. It would have provided another route to reach Mizoram from Kolkata through Sitwe.RelatedStoriesChina to build port in Myanmar, third in India's neighbourhoodMyanmar to grant visa-on-arrival for Indian touristsIndian military delegation in Myanmar to boost trust, cooperation
