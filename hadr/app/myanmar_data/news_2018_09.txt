Title: New Age | A legacy of the British colonial policy
THE Rohingya are the inhabitants of Rakhine state (historically known as Arakan) in Myanmar. Arakan emerged as a kingdom with the military and diplomatic assistance of Bengal Sultanate in the year 1429. Being far off and detached from mainland Burma by the Arakan Yoma (meaning mountain) and contiguous to Bengal (Bangladesh and West Bengal), it flourished as an independent Kingdom of Arakan by receiving social and political influences from Bengal during late medieval period. One of its inhabitants were the Rohingya — a minority community that developed out of different ethnicities having their origin in Bengal, West Asia, and Central Asia. The Rohingya as a community developed undergoing a process of creolisation as a socio-religious polity with the leniency of the imperial authority of Arakan. Later they were joined by a new flux of Bengali people leading to an increase in the Rohingya population under the British colonial rule. Thus Rohingya share the religion, language, and ethnicity with the people of Bangladesh and some Indian states such as Assam.In the past decades, the Rohingya as an ethnic minority underwent several constitutional and administrative forfeiture set by the Burmese Government — this began in the year 1948 and finally lead to be ‘non-national’ or ‘foreign residents’ under a citizenship law passed in 1982. Last year, they fled their homeland of Arakan en masse to escape a drive (August-September 2017) of persecution (to be described as ethnic cleansing) conducted by the Myanmar military Junta and became stateless. The present plight of statelessness of the Rohingya people is assumed to stem from the British colonial policy undertaken over the Arakan during the colonial period.Historically, Arakan was not a part of Myanmar (Burma), rather it was an independent kingdom that existed from 1429 to 1785. Arakan was established in 1429 with the military and diplomatic assistance of the Bengal Sultanate as a vassal and flourished as a powerful kingdom which existed until 1785. In 1785, it was conquered and occupied by the Burmese (Konbaung Dynasty) invading forces and consequently fell into a cycle of crisis. As soon as the Burmese forces rose to power, they started a drive to deport and exterminate their opponents and this affected both the Rakhine and the Rohingya people as inhabitants of Arakan. This was the first atrocity the Burmese imperialist forces committed on the Rohingya people. Rakhine state (i.e. Arakan) still remains a scarcely inhabited state of Myanmar since that Burmese conquest. A few decades after the conquest of the Burmese force, the first Anglo-Burmese war broke out (1824-1826) over the domination of the Burmese colony. At the end of this first Anglo-Burmese war, the Burmese forces lost to the British colonial power and it had to cede Arakan to the British East India Company as war reparation in 1826. Initially, the British authority put Arakan under the Bengal Presidency as it took over Arakan when many settlers joined the Rohingya from the neighboring Chittagong Division. In 1937, the British colonial authority separated Arakan from the Bengal presidency and annexed it to Burma Province. This administrative decision of annexation of Arakan to Burma later gave the Burmese polity a political legitimacy to assert administrative authority over Arakan. The British decision to annex Arakan with Burma sparked movement among the Rohingya for their to join East Pakistan when the Pakistan movement was at its height. However, the British colonial authority ignored the demand in restoring Arakan as a province of East Pakistan. Rather, it annexed Arakan with the independent Republic of the Union of Burma one year later when they withdrew from British Burma on January 04, 1948.Thus, the record of Burmese rule over Arakan shows us that the Burmese political authority ruled over Arakan for about a 100 years. During the first period of its rule, the Burmese colonial authority could not assert thorough administrative control over the inhabitants of Arakan. Hence, as a colonial force, it failed to win legitimacy over the Arakan. However, during the British colonial period, Arakan was under the administration of Bengal presidency which gave British Bengal the authority to rule Arakan. When the British were planning to withdraw the authority over Arakan, they had three options under their consideration: i) giving Arakan independence which would free it from both Pakistan (East Pakistan) and Burma, ii) annexation as a province to Pakistan and iii) annexation as a province to Burma. The Rohingya opted for the first one and become independent state free from Pakistan and Burma, for which they launched a movement. However, the British imperial authority annexed it to Burma by ignoring the demand of the Rohingya community. This political decision of the British Imperial power resulted into loss of rights of self-determination of the Arakanese (the Rakhine and the Rohingya) and gave the Burmese polity a legitimacy in asserting the political authority over Arakan.After the withdrawal of British colonial power in 1948, the Burmese polity rose to political power over Arakan as it was annexed as a territory of Burma. The Burmese government then made efforts to consolidate power over Arakan with a democratic means. However, the inhabitants of Arakan, including both the Rakhine and the Rohingya were skeptic about the Burmese rule, for which they grew to be conscious about their political rights. Then (during 1948 to 1962), the Burmese polity as a democratic force was amicable to handle the rights of the Arakanese. Therefore, during this period, their policy did not impair the democratic rights of the Arakanese and the human rights of the Rohingya people remained upheld. However, the Burmese polity failed to consolidate political power over Arakan with this interim (during 1948 to 1962) democratic policy. A similar situation could be seen happening in other regions of Burma as the Burmese government also failed to assert political dominance over the other ethnic communities like Shan and Karen. The failure of the Burmese polity in consolidating its political power over the Burmese states caused a dissatisfaction among the military authority. Consequently, a new political transformation occurred when the Burmese military occupied political administration by carrying out a coup d’état on March 02, 1962. The Burmese military set forth totalitarian rule as it rose to the political power. This marks the return of aggressive policies towards Rohingyas. The Burmese military junta launched a fresh drive over non-Burmese ethnic communities to consolidate their political authority. Therefore, the maneuvers which are being wielded by the military junta over the Rohingya can be seen as the manifestation of their attempts at consolidating political power over Arakan. The recent drive conducted considered to be a kind of an extreme military maneuver by the junta which forced the Rohingyas to leave their motherland Arakan en masse to Bangladesh and left them in a plight of statelessness. The plight of statelessness of the Rohingyas can, therefore, be seen as the end of this longstanding process, the onset of which can be attributed to the British policy over Arakan. In the first instance of the Burmese conquest, the takeover lasted only 40 years (from 1785 to 1925), when the Burmese authority could not consolidate power over Arakan. It is the British colonial policy which gave the Burmese polity a legitimacy to assert the authority over Arakan.The British colonial policy giving Burmese polity a legitimacy to assert the political authority over the Arakan occurred in two phases. In the first phase, the British colonial authority separated Arakan from the Bengal presidency and annexed it as a province to Burma in 1937. In the second phase, the British colonial authority gave Arakan independence as a part of Burma by ignoring the Rohingyas` rights of self-determination. Hence, the political decision by the British colonial power gave the present military junta of Burma the right to rule Arakan and exert different means of maneuvers which caused to create the present plight of statelessness of the Rohingyas. Given the afore-mentioned discussion on the role of the British colonial authority in the creation of crisis in Arakan, the present plight of statelessness of the Rohingya people can be attributed to undue British colonial policy exercised over Arkan during 1926 to 1948.

Title: Rohingya 'could've been handle better': Suu Kyi | Asia – Gulf News
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi speaks about brutal crackdown on Muslims in Rakhine state
Hanoi: Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday said in hindsight her government could have handled the situation in Rakhine state better.
Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Rakhine after government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base in August 2017.
"There are of course ways in which, with hindsight, the situation could've been handled better," Suu Kyi said at the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi.
"But we believe that in order to have long-term security and stability we have to be fair to all sides. We can't choose who should be protected by rule of law," she said.

Title: The Rohingya problem: Some reflections and much work to be done at the UN 
September 13, 2024


Published :26 Sep 2018, 10:20 PM
Updated :26 Sep 2018, 10:20 PM
Having been responsible, in 1971, for the humanitarian needs of about 600,000 Bangladeshi refugees, in over 50 Oxfam-supported refugee camps in all the States bordering India and Bangladesh and having visited the Rohingya Refugee Camps in Cox's Bazar District in 2017, I am often asked about my extensive feelings and how I see the future for these people from the  Rakhine State.
In 1971 we knew that all the refugees from Bangladesh wished to return to their homes in Bangladesh after the fighting ceased. They wanted to return home. In fact they returned home much quicker than we expected and all the refugees had returned to Bangladesh by the end of February 1972. The Rohingyas do not feel the same way. They have been systematically attacked, tortured and suffered humiliating discrimination on a regular basis since the independence from the British in 1948. There is a record of 21 such armed 'Clearance Operations' since that year. Why would they want to return 'home' to the Rakhine State?
Last Wednesday, September 19, Britain's Foreign Secretary was visiting Myanmar. How many people including Ministers have to visit Myanmar and Cox's Bazar before deciding what to say at the UN?
I was very angry that when people (especially foreigners) started writing about the crisis a year ago and most of them did not do any historical research, even recent history. In early 1992, I attended a UNHCR meeting in Dhaka about a Rohingya influx at that time. 20 years ago, while working with the Red Cross, I had oversight of the Red Cross/Red Crescent work among about 30,000 refugees in Kutapalong and Nayapara camps. However, to understand things much more, one needs to go back many centuries at which time eastern Bengal had become a cauldron in which a mixture of different races had bubbled, boiled over, and occasionally quietly simmered.
Although Islam had touched the coastal areas of Bengal between the 8th and 12th centuries, it was in the 13th century when Muhammad Bakhtiyar established a Muslim ruled state, the first of many dominated by non-Bengalis, including Turks, North Indians, Afghans, Arakanese and Ethiopians.
In the 16th century Portuguese freebooters from Goa secured a foothold but, failing to found an empire, either entered service of the rajahs of Arakan as mercenaries or turned pirate. The struggle for supremacy between the Muslims and Buddhists came to a head in 1661 when the rajah of Arakan put to death the Mogul viceroy of Bengal who had sought refuge with him, leading to a punitive expedition which resulted in the whole Arakan district becoming a province of the Mogul empire. Chittagong for some time was known as Islamabad. And for a while the cauldron simmered, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Catholic living an uneasy peace with one another.
The Burmese conquered Arakan in the 1780s which led to the arrival of refugees including many militants who then used the British territory as a base from which to launch counter-attacks against the Burmese occupying Arakan. When some sort of peace treaty had been agreed, Captain Cox had the task of looking after thirty to forty thousand refugees.
British policy encouraged Bengali inhabitants from adjacent regions to migrate into the then lightly populated and fertile valleys of Arakan as farm labourers. The East India Company extended the Bengal Presidency to Arakan. There was no international boundary between Bengal and Arakan and no restrictions on migration between the regions. In the early 19th  century, thousands of Bengalis from the Chittagong region settled in Arakan seeking work (The Development of a Muslim Enclave in Arakan (Rakhine) State of Burma (Myanmar). Aye Chan. Page 403). It is hard to know whether these new Bengal migrants were the same population that was deported by force to Bengal's Chittagong during the Burmese conquest in the 18th century and later returned to Arakan as a result of British policy or they were a new migrant population with no ancestral roots to Arakan ("Rohingya and national identities in Burma". New Mandala. 2014-09-22).
A great uncle of mine who lived and worked in Rangoon in the 1930s said that although a few Rohingya trace their ancestry to Muslims who lived in Arakan in the 15th and 16th centuries, most Rohingyas arrived with the British colonialists in the 19th and 20th centuries
I wonder how many people have taken the trouble to understand that for centuries the Burmese have wanted the Arakan Muslims out of Burma. It is not just something that has festered since Independence in 1948. Now, it seems, Chinese connected commercial interests are pushing state sponsored land-grabbing at a fast rate.
It is said that there is some evidence that the British may have promised that the Rakhine State would be part of East Pakistan as part of a reward for fighting with the British against the Japanese in the Second World War. The Burmese had sided, for some time at least, with the Japanese.
The international community has neglected the Rohingya problem for decades and now, with some countries blocking negotiations, the way ahead is uncertain to say the least. Severe sanctions should have been clamped down on Myanmar a long time ago.
In October last year, as part of a 'Citizens' Commission for Investigating Genocide and Terrorism in Burma ', I visited the Kutapulong and Balukhali refugee camps at Teknaf. Collecting evidence that could be used in any submission to the International Criminal Court, we interviewed a number of refugees who had recently arrived in Cox's Bazar District. One man told us that:
– no new mosques could be built for the last 20 years
– they have not been able to pray in existing mosques for the last 5 years
– even in a village with 100 Muslim families and 5 Buddhist families, the village leader always has to be Buddhist
– children have not been able/allowed to go to school since August 25, 2017
– married couples are not allowed to have more than two children
– birth registration has not been done for the last few years
– the nearest health facility is 1.75 miles away but only Burmese Buddhists are seen there from 2015
– in 2010, he and his father were forced to vote (to give a semblance of 'democracy')
Although the Rohingya from Rakhine have no status, many of the Rohingya I talked to said they would go back to their homes in Rakhine State if they were convinced it would be safe, their land was restored to them and ownership was guaranteed and they were given Myanmar citizenship. A number of them said that they had brought their land documents with them and so could prove ownership. However, one old woman told me that this was the third time she had escaped persecution and certain death and come to Bangladesh as a refugee, and that this time she would refuse to go back to Rakhine State. It will, indeed, be very difficult to persuade many Rohingya to return to Rakhine State.
As demanded by the refugees, the pre-requisites for repatriation are:
– Recognition of the Rohingya as an indigenous ethnic minority of Myanmar
– Issuance of national security cards to all Rohingya
– Lift all form of restrictions and harassments such as travel ban, marriage restriction, land and property confiscation, extortion, arbitrary arrest, forced ration collection for army etc.
– Stop building model villages and send back all model villagers to their original villages
– Return all confiscated lands and properties to the original owners
– Give assurance for religious freedom
– Give access for higher education and provide enough hospitals and medical facilities in northern Arakan.
Many officials working in Cox's Bazar realize that it is likely that the refugees will be here for years to come. Therefore, it is vitally important that the local or host communities receive development assistance at the same time as the refugees are receiving relief and humanitarian assistance.
A lot of hard work needs to be done at the United Nations in the coming days…

Title: Understanding Inter-ethnic Conflict in Myanmar - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Given the many ethnic groups in Myanmar, the territorial demands of smaller ethnic groups such as the Palaung/Ta’ang within Shan state complicate negotiations to establish a peaceful, federal union. Under the 2008 constitution, the Palaung Self-Administered Zone was established, consisting of Namhsan and Manton townships in northern Shan state. It is one of five self-administered zones and divisions in Shan state. With the support of the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA), the PSLF/TNLA, comprised of ethnic Palaung/Ta’ang, has been able to grow its army. In expanding its reach, the PSLF/TNLA has argued for two additional townships — Namhkam and Kyaukme — to be part of the Palaung Self-Administered Zone. An ally of the PSLF/TNLA, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), has proposed awarding self-administered states, divisions, and zones based on an ethnic group’s population (Euro-Burma Office, September 2016). The Myanmar military has rejected this proposal.
After signing the NCA in late 2015, the RCSS/SSA-S increased its presence in northern Shan Montstate, which led to clashes between the PSLF/TNLA and the RCSS/SSA-S. The RCSS/SSA-S, which had been primarily based in southern and eastern Shan state, has claimed that all Shan-inhabited areas are legitimate areas of operation (Asia Times, 16 August 2018). The PSLF/TNLA views this movement northwards as trespassing and has claimed that the RCSS/SSA-S and the Myanmar military have collaborated to fight the PSLF/TNLA (Radio Free Asia, 01 December 2015). Yet, despite signing the NCA, the RCSS/SSA-S itself still occasionally clashes with the Myanmar military (The Irrawaddy, 12 September 2018). In addition to clashes, both the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA have traded accusations against one another regarding the abuse of civilians (The Irrawaddy, 05 September 2018). The PSLF/TNLA’s arrest in August of an ethnic Shan woman, for example, has resulted in significant protests in Namhkam township (The Irrawaddy, 17 September 2018).
Since July 2018, the PSLF/TNLA has joined with the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA-N) to fight the RCSS/SSA-S. The bilateral military alliance that has emerged between the PSLF/TNLA and SSPP/SSA-N has been reinforced by their membership in the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). The FPNCC is an alliance of seven EAOs — including the Northern Alliance (a military alliance of four EAOs led by the KIO/KIA; for more on the Northern Alliance, seethis recent ACLED piece) — that have yet to sign the NCA (see Figure 2). Led by the UWSA, the EAOs of the FPNCC have strengthened their respective positions in peace negotiations with the government and military through their involvement in the alliance (United States Institute of Peace, 14 September 2018).
In 2018, much of the fighting between the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA has happened in and around Namtu township, a region rich in natural resources. Namtu is home to the historic Bawdwin mine, once a world supplier of lead, silver, and zinc. An Australian mining company has recently invested in developing the mine (Frontier Myanmar, 31 January 2018). The Yeywa Dam on the Namtu river — a project backed by Chinese, German, Swiss, and Japanese companies — has likewise caused tension in villages down the river from Namtu township in Kyaukme district (Shan Herald Agency for News, 12 September 2018). Further, Namtu is situated along the Shwe Gas and Oil Pipeline route. A joint venture between the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the military-linked Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), the pipeline route has been the cause of increased militarization in the region (The Irrawaddy, 07 November 2012).
In addition to the conflict between the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA, Namtu township has also been the site of fighting between the Myanmar military and several EAOs (see Figure 3). Given the natural wealth of the region, and the involvement of international actors in Namtu and the surrounding areas, the desire of armed actors in northern Shan state to control the region is likely to lead to more conflict in the future and further displacement of villagers (The Myanmar Times, 05 September 2018). Thus, clashes between the PSLF/TNLA and the RCSS/SSA-S are likely to continue with Namtu township being a key locus of conflict.

Title: Ethnic Armed Groups to Meet Myanmar Peace Commission For Talks in China - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Representatives from a coalition of ethnic armies based along the China-Myanmar border will meet with members of the government’s peace commission in southwest China on Wednesday to discuss ways to end decades of civil war, a spokesman for one of the militias told RFA on Tuesday.
The meeting will mark the first time that the Union Peace Commission is meeting with the Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said TNLA spokesman Brigadier General Ta Phone Kyaw.
The three groups, which along with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) make up the Northern Alliance military coalition, have not signed the government’s 2015 nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) because of ongoing hostilities with the national army.
“The TNLA, AA, and MNDAA will meet with the government’s Peace Commission on Sept. 5 in Kunming,” Ta Phone Kyaw said, adding that he and others from the TNLA’s information team will attend the event.
“We will talk with them [Union Peace Commission members] about ways to stop the fighting and to start discussions,” he said.
“We hope to have a good result since we finally have a chance to meet with government’s peace commission,” he said, adding that the meeting is “a good step.”
In April 2017, the Northern Alliance joined a political coalition called the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) with three other ethnic armed groups — the United Wa State Army (UWSA) the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), and the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N).
By teaming up with the UWSA, Myanmar’s largest ethnic army with a force of some 30,000 troops, the Northern Alliance moved from being primarily a military alliance to a political one, according to a July 2018 report by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) which collects data on political violence in developing states.
Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs under China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, has facilitated the meeting in Kunming, capital of southwest China’s Yunnan province, and is serving as mediator, Ta Phone Kyaw said.
China, which provided support to Myanmar to hold a third round of peace talks in July under the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) government, has said that it firmly opposes any attempt to undermine peace and stability along the China-Myanmar border and any act deliberately obstructing Myanmar’s peace process.
China is also believed by security experts to be the direct or indirect source of weapons for many of the ethnic armies fighting the Myanmar government.
Previously, the Myanmar army refused to negotiate with the FPNCC and Northern Alliance on account of the inclusion in the coalitions of the AA, TNLA, and MNDAA, which all lack bilateral cease-fire agreements with the military.
All members of both coalitions, however, attended the third and most recent session of the government’s peace talks as observers and met in separate groups on the sidelines of the conference with leaders from the armed forces and government, including military commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi.
Ongoing clashes in Shan state
Some ethnic armed groups have continued to fight the Myanmar military in the border areas in their quest for a federal democratic union in the country with a constitutional guarantee for a certain degree of autonomy for ethnic minorities.
The ongoing hostilities, particularly in Shan and Kachin states, have stymied the peace process and have led to delays in scheduling rounds of meetings.
So far, 10 ethnic armed groups have signed the NCA, which forms the foundation of the government’s peace talks.
Myanmar forces and the TNLA are engaged in hostilities in the northern part of Shan state, while the TNLA and the Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA-N), the armed wing of the Shan State Progress Party, are also fighting rival Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S) troops.
TNLA and SSA-N troops have launched offensives on RCSS/SSA-S soldiers in Namtu township since July 5, military officials from the TNLA and SSA-N combined unit said Tuesday.
More than 2,000 people from Namtu township are fleeing to safer places because of fighting, they said, adding that they have warned local residents to exercise caution when traveling through the area.
Leaders of the combined forces also said that they will continue their offensives against the RCSS/SSA-S troops until they retreat from SSA-S headquarters in Loi Tai Leng, a town located in the mountainous region of southern Shan state.
The TNLA has been fighting both the Myanmar army and the RCSS/SSA-S in Shan state since late November 2015.
Troops from the TNLA have also clashed with SSPP/SSA-N forces at least four times around Namtu township since December 2017 over apparent territorial disputes, though both armies are members of the FPNCC, according to the ACLED report.
Overall, more than 10,000 civilians have been displaced by fighting in volatile areas of Shan state.

TNLA Puts Abducted Shan Woman ‘On Trial’

Nang Mo Hom is taken away from her home in Namhkam Township, northern Shan State by TNLA members on Aug. 17, 2018. / Facebook

September 5th, 2018  |  09:12 AM  |816 views
CHIANG MAI, THAILAND

The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) said on Monday it had put on trial a Shan woman whom it took from her home at gunpoint last month in Namhkam Township, northern Shan State.

Nang Mo Hom is being tried in the TNLA’s central court for allegedly obstructing its troops as they performed their duties, the group said.

Five TNLA troops arrested Nang Mo Hom at gunpoint on Aug. 17. Since then she has not been able to meet her family, despite demands for her release by local civil society groups.  A Shan political party, the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), on Aug. 27 sent a letter to State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi requesting that she intervene, in her capacity as the head of the National Reconciliation and Peace Center (NRPC), to assist Nang Mo Hom.

The TNLA said in a Sept. 3 statement that Nang Mo Hom had been charged under its own authority with obstructing its troops as they attempted to collect customs duties, and that her actions had resulted in the death of one of the officers.

TNLA spokesman Mai Aik Kyaw told The Irrawaddy on Tuesday that the Palaung State Liberation Front (PSLF)/TNLA court would hear the case against the woman, who was charged by the group under Article 333 of Myanmar’s Criminal Code. When it came time to hand down a verdict, the spokesman said, the TNLA court “would try to make it a public hearing held before members of the public, including the family of the woman.” He did not say when the verdict was expected.

Mai Aik Kyaw said Nang Mo Hom had committed a crime under the law as enforced by the TNLA. He was referring to an incident in July 2017 when two TNLA soldiers were attacked by the Myanmar Army for allegedly extorting money from local businesses in Namhkam Township.

Relatives of Nang Mo Hom said the TNLA had been extorting money from them for two years until July 2017, when one TNLA soldier was shot dead and another arrested and imprisoned in Lashio Prison after demanding 1 million kyats from the family.

The TNLA’s announcement on Monday raised eyebrows, with observers asking how an organization that itself operates outside the country’s laws could justify putting a woman on trial for breaking “its laws”.

Addressing this point, Mai Aik Kyaw said, “As we are an armed group and not a ceasefire group, we cannot seek justice at the official township court.” Therefore, they arranged their own justice, he said.

“The hearing is ongoing. On the day of the verdict we will invite her [Nang Mo Hom’s] family and relatives to attend,” he told The Irrawaddy.

SNLD spokesman Sai Leik raised doubts about the legitimacy of the move. “The question is whether they have the legal and judicial authority,” Sai Leik said, adding that, as the TNLA’s administration lacks legitimacy, “how can we acknowledge their judgment?”

“We do not recognize their judiciary, which is illegal and run by an illegal organization,” Sai Leik said, adding that the SNLD, as a registered political party, cannot directly communicate with TNLA and had therefore sought the NRPC’s intervention.

However, the NRPC is unlikely to be able to intervene in the case. As with most affairs in conflict-torn Shan State, such issues usually require the involvement of the armed forces, on both the government and the ethnic groups’ sides.

Sai Leik told The Irrawaddy the NRPC had not responded to their request yet, though it was submitted over a week ago.

The Irrawaddy was unable to contact NRPC vice chairman Dr. Tin Myo Win, who is also chairman of the Peace Commission and the government’s chief negotiator with the ethnic armed organizations. Other members of the commission contacted by The Irrawaddy declined to comment.

Sai Leik called for an end to the fighting in Shan State, especially in the north, saying the TNLA and its allies had deliberately turned the area into a “war zone” in order to protect their interests.

“If things are allowed to develop in that direction, the chances of peace will get more remote, and this only harms the public, and social tensions between the ethnic groups will only escalate,” the SNLD spokesman said.

Since the TNLA’s abduction of the Shan woman, a war of words has erupted among Facebook users supporting either the Shan or Ta’ang, who accuse each other’s armed forces of human rights violations. It is hard to verify whether individual social media users are actually Ta’ang or Shan, however.

Title: Ethnic Armed Groups Meet in China With Myanmar Peace Commission - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Representatives of ethnic armies based along the China-Myanmar border met briefly with Myanmar government peace negotiators on Wednesday in a get-together described as positive but yielding little in the way of specific proposals, a spokesman for one of the militias told RFA’s Myanmar Service.
The meeting, held in Kunming in southern China’s Yunnan province, marked the first time that members of the government’s Union Peace Commission met with representatives of the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
The three armies, which along with the Kachin Independence Organization/Army (KIO/A) make up the Northern Alliance military coalition, have not yet signed the government’s 2015 nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) because of ongoing hostilities with the national army.
Representatives of the KIO/A and the United Wa State Army (UWSA), another armed group, were also present as observers, Myanmar news outlet The Irrawaddy said in a Sept. 5 report.
Representing the Myanmar government were Peace Commission vice chairman U Thein Zaw and secretary Khin Zaw Oo, The Irrawaddy said.
Speaking to RFA’s Myanmar Service, TNLA spokesman Brigadier General Ta Phone Kyaw said that Wednesday’s two-hour meeting, the first for government representatives and the armed groups attending, had left little time for detailed discussions, but was “positive, and a good step forward.”
Talks focused on why political discussions held earlier had ended, and how they could be started again, Ta Phone Kyaw said.
“Although we didn’t arrive at actual agreements during the meeting, we did say we would meet again in October. Both sides are now going to inform their higher-level leaders about what we discussed,” he said.
Representatives from Myanmar’s national army, which has refused to meet with nonsignatories to the NCA, were not present at Wednesday’s meeting, Ta Phone Kyaw said, adding “We must overcome these prohibitions by the government army against face-to-face talks.”
“If these groups are ignored in the peace process, we won’t have peace,” he said.
“And we won’t be able to change the country’s politics.”

Title: Ethnic Armed Groups to Meet Myanmar Peace Commission For Talks in China - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Representatives from a coalition of ethnic armies based along the China-Myanmar border will meet with members of the government’s peace commission in southwest China on Wednesday to discuss ways to end decades of civil war, a spokesman for one of the militias told RFA on Tuesday.
The meeting will mark the first time that the Union Peace Commission is meeting with the Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said TNLA spokesman Brigadier General Ta Phone Kyaw.
The three groups, which along with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) make up the Northern Alliance military coalition, have not signed the government’s 2015 nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) because of ongoing hostilities with the national army.
“The TNLA, AA, and MNDAA will meet with the government’s Peace Commission on Sept. 5 in Kunming,” Ta Phone Kyaw said, adding that he and others from the TNLA’s information team will attend the event.
“We will talk with them [Union Peace Commission members] about ways to stop the fighting and to start discussions,” he said.
“We hope to have a good result since we finally have a chance to meet with government’s peace commission,” he said, adding that the meeting is “a good step.”
In April 2017, the Northern Alliance joined a political coalition called the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) with three other ethnic armed groups — the United Wa State Army (UWSA) the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), and the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N).
By teaming up with the UWSA, Myanmar’s largest ethnic army with a force of some 30,000 troops, the Northern Alliance moved from being primarily a military alliance to a political one, according to a July 2018 report by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) which collects data on political violence in developing states.
Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs under China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, has facilitated the meeting in Kunming, capital of southwest China’s Yunnan province, and is serving as mediator, Ta Phone Kyaw said.
China, which provided support to Myanmar to hold a third round of peace talks in July under the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) government, has said that it firmly opposes any attempt to undermine peace and stability along the China-Myanmar border and any act deliberately obstructing Myanmar’s peace process.
China is also believed by security experts to be the direct or indirect source of weapons for many of the ethnic armies fighting the Myanmar government.
Previously, the Myanmar army refused to negotiate with the FPNCC and Northern Alliance on account of the inclusion in the coalitions of the AA, TNLA, and MNDAA, which all lack bilateral cease-fire agreements with the military.
All members of both coalitions, however, attended the third and most recent session of the government’s peace talks as observers and met in separate groups on the sidelines of the conference with leaders from the armed forces and government, including military commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi.
Ongoing clashes in Shan state
Some ethnic armed groups have continued to fight the Myanmar military in the border areas in their quest for a federal democratic union in the country with a constitutional guarantee for a certain degree of autonomy for ethnic minorities.
The ongoing hostilities, particularly in Shan and Kachin states, have stymied the peace process and have led to delays in scheduling rounds of meetings.
So far, 10 ethnic armed groups have signed the NCA, which forms the foundation of the government’s peace talks.
Myanmar forces and the TNLA are engaged in hostilities in the northern part of Shan state, while the TNLA and the Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA-N), the armed wing of the Shan State Progress Party, are also fighting rival Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S) troops.
TNLA and SSA-N troops have launched offensives on RCSS/SSA-S soldiers in Namtu township since July 5, military officials from the TNLA and SSA-N combined unit said Tuesday.
More than 2,000 people from Namtu township are fleeing to safer places because of fighting, they said, adding that they have warned local residents to exercise caution when traveling through the area.
Leaders of the combined forces also said that they will continue their offensives against the RCSS/SSA-S troops until they retreat from SSA-S headquarters in Loi Tai Leng, a town located in the mountainous region of southern Shan state.
The TNLA has been fighting both the Myanmar army and the RCSS/SSA-S in Shan state since late November 2015.
Troops from the TNLA have also clashed with SSPP/SSA-N forces at least four times around Namtu township since December 2017 over apparent territorial disputes, though both armies are members of the FPNCC, according to the ACLED report.
Overall, more than 10,000 civilians have been displaced by fighting in volatile areas of Shan state.

Title: Understanding Inter-ethnic Conflict in Myanmar - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Given the many ethnic groups in Myanmar, the territorial demands of smaller ethnic groups such as the Palaung/Ta’ang within Shan state complicate negotiations to establish a peaceful, federal union. Under the 2008 constitution, the Palaung Self-Administered Zone was established, consisting of Namhsan and Manton townships in northern Shan state. It is one of five self-administered zones and divisions in Shan state. With the support of the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA), the PSLF/TNLA, comprised of ethnic Palaung/Ta’ang, has been able to grow its army. In expanding its reach, the PSLF/TNLA has argued for two additional townships — Namhkam and Kyaukme — to be part of the Palaung Self-Administered Zone. An ally of the PSLF/TNLA, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), has proposed awarding self-administered states, divisions, and zones based on an ethnic group’s population (Euro-Burma Office, September 2016). The Myanmar military has rejected this proposal.
After signing the NCA in late 2015, the RCSS/SSA-S increased its presence in northern Shan Montstate, which led to clashes between the PSLF/TNLA and the RCSS/SSA-S. The RCSS/SSA-S, which had been primarily based in southern and eastern Shan state, has claimed that all Shan-inhabited areas are legitimate areas of operation (Asia Times, 16 August 2018). The PSLF/TNLA views this movement northwards as trespassing and has claimed that the RCSS/SSA-S and the Myanmar military have collaborated to fight the PSLF/TNLA (Radio Free Asia, 01 December 2015). Yet, despite signing the NCA, the RCSS/SSA-S itself still occasionally clashes with the Myanmar military (The Irrawaddy, 12 September 2018). In addition to clashes, both the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA have traded accusations against one another regarding the abuse of civilians (The Irrawaddy, 05 September 2018). The PSLF/TNLA’s arrest in August of an ethnic Shan woman, for example, has resulted in significant protests in Namhkam township (The Irrawaddy, 17 September 2018).
Since July 2018, the PSLF/TNLA has joined with the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA-N) to fight the RCSS/SSA-S. The bilateral military alliance that has emerged between the PSLF/TNLA and SSPP/SSA-N has been reinforced by their membership in the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC). The FPNCC is an alliance of seven EAOs — including the Northern Alliance (a military alliance of four EAOs led by the KIO/KIA; for more on the Northern Alliance, seethis recent ACLED piece) — that have yet to sign the NCA (see Figure 2). Led by the UWSA, the EAOs of the FPNCC have strengthened their respective positions in peace negotiations with the government and military through their involvement in the alliance (United States Institute of Peace, 14 September 2018).
In 2018, much of the fighting between the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA has happened in and around Namtu township, a region rich in natural resources. Namtu is home to the historic Bawdwin mine, once a world supplier of lead, silver, and zinc. An Australian mining company has recently invested in developing the mine (Frontier Myanmar, 31 January 2018). The Yeywa Dam on the Namtu river — a project backed by Chinese, German, Swiss, and Japanese companies — has likewise caused tension in villages down the river from Namtu township in Kyaukme district (Shan Herald Agency for News, 12 September 2018). Further, Namtu is situated along the Shwe Gas and Oil Pipeline route. A joint venture between the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the military-linked Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), the pipeline route has been the cause of increased militarization in the region (The Irrawaddy, 07 November 2012).
In addition to the conflict between the RCSS/SSA-S and the PSLF/TNLA, Namtu township has also been the site of fighting between the Myanmar military and several EAOs (see Figure 3). Given the natural wealth of the region, and the involvement of international actors in Namtu and the surrounding areas, the desire of armed actors in northern Shan state to control the region is likely to lead to more conflict in the future and further displacement of villagers (The Myanmar Times, 05 September 2018). Thus, clashes between the PSLF/TNLA and the RCSS/SSA-S are likely to continue with Namtu township being a key locus of conflict.

TNLA Puts Abducted Shan Woman ‘On Trial’

Nang Mo Hom is taken away from her home in Namhkam Township, northern Shan State by TNLA members on Aug. 17, 2018. / Facebook

September 5th, 2018  |  09:12 AM  |817 views
CHIANG MAI, THAILAND

The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) said on Monday it had put on trial a Shan woman whom it took from her home at gunpoint last month in Namhkam Township, northern Shan State.

Nang Mo Hom is being tried in the TNLA’s central court for allegedly obstructing its troops as they performed their duties, the group said.

Five TNLA troops arrested Nang Mo Hom at gunpoint on Aug. 17. Since then she has not been able to meet her family, despite demands for her release by local civil society groups.  A Shan political party, the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), on Aug. 27 sent a letter to State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi requesting that she intervene, in her capacity as the head of the National Reconciliation and Peace Center (NRPC), to assist Nang Mo Hom.

The TNLA said in a Sept. 3 statement that Nang Mo Hom had been charged under its own authority with obstructing its troops as they attempted to collect customs duties, and that her actions had resulted in the death of one of the officers.

TNLA spokesman Mai Aik Kyaw told The Irrawaddy on Tuesday that the Palaung State Liberation Front (PSLF)/TNLA court would hear the case against the woman, who was charged by the group under Article 333 of Myanmar’s Criminal Code. When it came time to hand down a verdict, the spokesman said, the TNLA court “would try to make it a public hearing held before members of the public, including the family of the woman.” He did not say when the verdict was expected.

Mai Aik Kyaw said Nang Mo Hom had committed a crime under the law as enforced by the TNLA. He was referring to an incident in July 2017 when two TNLA soldiers were attacked by the Myanmar Army for allegedly extorting money from local businesses in Namhkam Township.

Relatives of Nang Mo Hom said the TNLA had been extorting money from them for two years until July 2017, when one TNLA soldier was shot dead and another arrested and imprisoned in Lashio Prison after demanding 1 million kyats from the family.

The TNLA’s announcement on Monday raised eyebrows, with observers asking how an organization that itself operates outside the country’s laws could justify putting a woman on trial for breaking “its laws”.

Addressing this point, Mai Aik Kyaw said, “As we are an armed group and not a ceasefire group, we cannot seek justice at the official township court.” Therefore, they arranged their own justice, he said.

“The hearing is ongoing. On the day of the verdict we will invite her [Nang Mo Hom’s] family and relatives to attend,” he told The Irrawaddy.

SNLD spokesman Sai Leik raised doubts about the legitimacy of the move. “The question is whether they have the legal and judicial authority,” Sai Leik said, adding that, as the TNLA’s administration lacks legitimacy, “how can we acknowledge their judgment?”

“We do not recognize their judiciary, which is illegal and run by an illegal organization,” Sai Leik said, adding that the SNLD, as a registered political party, cannot directly communicate with TNLA and had therefore sought the NRPC’s intervention.

However, the NRPC is unlikely to be able to intervene in the case. As with most affairs in conflict-torn Shan State, such issues usually require the involvement of the armed forces, on both the government and the ethnic groups’ sides.

Sai Leik told The Irrawaddy the NRPC had not responded to their request yet, though it was submitted over a week ago.

The Irrawaddy was unable to contact NRPC vice chairman Dr. Tin Myo Win, who is also chairman of the Peace Commission and the government’s chief negotiator with the ethnic armed organizations. Other members of the commission contacted by The Irrawaddy declined to comment.

Sai Leik called for an end to the fighting in Shan State, especially in the north, saying the TNLA and its allies had deliberately turned the area into a “war zone” in order to protect their interests.

“If things are allowed to develop in that direction, the chances of peace will get more remote, and this only harms the public, and social tensions between the ethnic groups will only escalate,” the SNLD spokesman said.

Since the TNLA’s abduction of the Shan woman, a war of words has erupted among Facebook users supporting either the Shan or Ta’ang, who accuse each other’s armed forces of human rights violations. It is hard to verify whether individual social media users are actually Ta’ang or Shan, however.

Catholic aid groups provide much-needed lifeline for ethnic group displaced by fighting near Myanmar's border
Myanmar's military and civilian authorities are blocking humanitarian aid from being delivered to thousands ofdisplaced ethnic Kachininconflict-torn Kachin Statedue to pressure from Beijing, according to a new report.
The majority of the state's1.7-million Kachin are Christians, including 116,000 Catholics.
Bangkok-based Fortify Rights said in its Aug. 30 report that the Chinese government has been privately urging Myanmar authorities and non-state ethnic armies to prevent U.N. and other aid organizations from operating on the Myanmar side of the border opposite China's Yunnan province, where tens of thousands of Kachin civilians remain displaced and in need of help.
David Baulk, a Myanmar human rights specialist with Fortify Rights, said Chinese involved inMyanmar's peace talks with its armed ethnic groupshave repeatedly made it clear that they view international humanitarian groups as "proxies for Western governments," especially the U.S.
The Chinese representatives stressed they did not want such groups operating on the Myanmar-China border, he said.
"Humanitarians delivering food, medicine, shelter and other life-saving materials should be welcomed by the Chinese government. Instead, Beijing is working in cahoots with Naypyidaw to make life almost unbearable for displaced communities in Kachin and northern Shan states," he told ucanews.com.
Beijing wants to "stabilize" the border by strangling displaced communities in areas currently under the control of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Baulk said.
The Myanmar and Chinese governments believe they can force the KIA into signing a peace agreement on their own terms by creating an environment in Kachin that is "more conducive to business," he added.
Bertil Lintner, a Swedish journalist and long-time Myanmar expert said it is probably true that China has urged the ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) not to accept aid from Western sources.
The UN now has almostno access to KIA-controlled areas, he said.
"The Chinese obviously want to control what — and who — is going in and out of those areas," Lintner said.
Aid workers say the military has imposed more restrictions on humanitarian groups and has banned any new camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) from opening.
Workers have also been threatened with charges of "unlawful association" if they provide aid in areas controlled by the KIA, according to reports.
On May 21, Col. Thura Myo Tin, Kachin's security and border affairs minister, sent a letter warning members of the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC) that they must stop visiting the IDP camps near the Chinese border or risk being charged under Article 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act as the camps are in KIA-held territory.
Naw Din, program coordinator of the local branch of the Catholic Church's charity arm Caritas, said this sent a strong signal not only to the KBC but to all aid groups operating in the region.
"We're being very careful about traveling and providing aid right now. We have to find ways to protect our workers from any added risk," said Naw Din.
The U.N. and its partners are finding it increasingly hard to obtain authorization from Myanmar for government-led groups to travel to the country, with most now only being granted access to major towns.
"Access constraints have a serious impact on the protection and welfare of conflict-affected people, including women, children and elderly people," the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (UNOCHA) said in a report.
It said displaced people are often left "without proper shelter and protection from heavy rains, wind and heat for extended periods, particularly in remote, hard-to reach areas."
Myanmar's army conceived its so-called "Four Cuts" strategy in the late 1960s as it battled the now-defunct Communist Party of Burma, as well as various ethnic armed groups.
The strategy entails cutting rebel groups' access to food, funds, new recruits and information, largely by removing the civilian population from their areas of activity.
Fortify Rights said the government's willful deprivation of humanitarian aid to displaced civilians in Kachin violates both "international human rights law and international humanitarian law," also known as the laws of war.
A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission report released on Aug. 27 confirmed there have been consistent violations of international law in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states.
The mission said Myanmar's top generals should face prosecution for crimes against humanity including genocide and war crimes.
China and Russia are expected to levy more pressure on Myanmar to stop such cases being referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by drawing on their power to veto at the U.N. Security Council, pundits say.
Both countries have proven themselves to be very supportive of Myanmar's handling of the Rohingya Muslim crisis in Rakhine, despite calls from the international community for more accountability and justice.
Local faith-based groups have resorted to clandestine humanitarian missions to make sure aid keeps getting through to IDPs near the Chinese border as U.N. agencies have been struggling to gain access for nearly two years.
Naw Din said aid workers are facing even more restrictions under Aung San Suu Kyi's government, however, and now require permission from state authorities even to operate in government-controlled areas.
Karuna (Caritas)has even been working to set up links with Chinese traders to offer aid to those in need.
"Amid all these difficulties, we're trying to find different ways to ensure those in dire straits along the border get what they need to survive," Naw Din, an ethnic Kachin, told ucanews.com.
Every time a fresh round of fighting erupts between the military and the KIA, security along the border is tightened and aid workers report facing more thorough checks from Chinese border guards and patrols.
Naw Din said thousands fled to China when the fighting flared up in August 2012 but Beijing forcibly returned them to Kachin State.
"China doesn't willingly accept refugees," he said.
Bishop Raymond Sumlut Gam of Banmaw Diocese said China "only cares about stability."
"Stability means no fighting and peace. Justice and human rights do not matter, in their eyes," added the bishop, who also serves as chairman of Karuna Myanmar. Karuna is the local name for Caritas.
Since 2011, the Church has provided not only spiritual support but also humanitarian assistance to people in IDP and other refugee camps.
Renewed fighting in Kachin State between the KIA and army has forced over 100,000 people into 142 camps in Kachin and Shan.
Nearly 40,000 of these people are living in territory that is not controlled by Myanmar's government, according to the U.N.

Title: MYANMAR – CHINA China hosts a meeting between Myanmar government and rebels
Northern ethnic armies are fighting government forces. Peace talks can reduce armed clashes. China wants a stable border to protect its investments. The success of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is based on access to the Indian Ocean through Myanmar.
Naypyidaw (AsiaNews) – China has for the first time hosted a meeting between Myanmar’s Peace Commission (PC) and the representatives of three armed groups from the Northern Alliance.
The Alliance includes four ethnic armies fighting the Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) in regions along the country’s northern border.
Unlike other groups, the four armies have not yet signed the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA).
Acting as mediator, Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs in China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, facilitated the brief meeting in Kunming.
The government was represented by PC vice chairman U Thein Zaw and secretary U Khin Zaw Oo, both former military generals.
They met with representatives of the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA,pictured), Arakan Army (AA), and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDDA).
Representatives of the fourth ethnic group, theKachin Independence Organisation(KIO), the political wing of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), were also present as observers.
Delegates from the United Wa State Army (UWSA) also attended. The latter also belongs to the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FNPCC) set up in April 2017.
Myanmar is strategically important for China. The success of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) hinges on access to the Indian Ocean through Myanmar.
Beijing, which supported the holding of the third session of the 21st Century Panglong Conference in July, has said it firmly opposes any attempt to undermine peace and stability along its border with Myanmar or to deliberately obstruct the country’s peace process.
Some analysts however point to Beijing's ambiguous attitude towards ethnic conflicts in northern Myanmar. The Chinese government has been particularly close to the FNPCC, especially the UWSA, with some suggesting that it is a direct or indirect source of weapons for many rebel armies.
At the same time, major investments in gas and oil, hydropower, jade and other minerals have doubtless shaped China’s push back on international calls for accountability as details of theMyanmar military’s crimeshave made headlines.
Human rights activists also accuse China of complicity in blocking humanitarian assistance to warrefugees caught along the border, scene offighting between the Myanmar military and the KIA.
A report by Fortify Rights slams both China and Myanmar for preventing international humanitarian groups from operating in areas with displaced population. China has also been accused of turning back refugees.
