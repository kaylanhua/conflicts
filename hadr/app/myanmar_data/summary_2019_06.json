Additionally, a security report stated that civilian casualties may be high, especially in Rakhine State.  \n   - **Details**: This joint military operation targeted various insurgent groups threatening the Kaladan multi-modal transit project, which aims to enhance connectivity between India and Myanmar.

The exact numbers are challenging to confirm due to the restricted access for journalists.  \n   - **Details**: Heavy clashes between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army led to artillery fire hitting civilian areas, causing fatalities among villagers. The ongoing conflict reflects deep-seated ethnic and territorial disputes, further complicated by external political influences and insurgent support.\n\n3. **Displacement Due to Armed Conflict**  \n   - **Location**: Kutkai Township, Shan State  \n   - **Casualties**: Over 200 people, including around 100 children, were displaced due to fighting between the Myanmar military and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) on June 16, 2019. Most of the displaced people later returned home, as reported by humanitarian organizations.  \n   - **Details**: This conflict indicates the ongoing violence in Shan State is recurrent, with similar cycles of displacement occurring repeatedly since late 2018. \n\n4. **Internet Shutdowns Impacting Rakhine State**  \n   - **Details**: Following intensified violence in Rakhine State, the Myanmar government imposed a mobile internet shutdown across nine townships, raising concerns among human rights organizations about the risk of increased violence against civilians and limited access to information. \n\nThese incidents showcase the interconnectedness of ethnic strife, governmental military operations, and humanitarian crises in Myanmar. The fluctuating state of conflict not only causes direct casualties but also contributes to long-term destabilization by forcing communities into ongoing cycles of displacement, violence, and human rights violations."}
