For weeks, since the Panghsang or Pangkham meeting of seven, non-signatory of Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) at the United Wa State Party/Army (UWSP/UWSA) headquarters, in February, the further existence of the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has been called into question, as its two strongest members, the Kachin Independence Organization/Army (KIO/KIA) and the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army (SSPP/SSA) were participants of the gathering, where “a new peace process approach”, rather the present NCA-based negotiation pattern was advocated, with the formation of “political negotiation committee – interim” poised to negotiate with the government, on a new track.
The Panghsang-led political alliance includes the seven EAOs, United Wa State Party/Army (UWSP/UWSA), United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA), Kachin Independence Organization/Army (KIO/KIA), Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA), Myanmar National Truth and Justice Party/Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNTJP/MNDAA), Peace and Solidarity Committee/National Democratic Alliance Army (PSC/NDAA) and Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army (SSPP/SSA) held a meeting from February 22 to 24, with New Mon State Party (NMSP) and Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) absence, although the two sent in position papers to the gathering.
Recently, the NMSP made public, its intention not to be part of the Panghsang-led coalition and instead would opt for the signing of the NCA. But KNPP still has not come up with any clarification on its part.
Panghsang rejection of the NCAThe main argument of Panghsang alliance is that the NCA is based on replacing the Panglong Agreement of 1947, which is the main political legacy and the sole legal bond between the Bamar and the non-Bamar ethnic nationalities’ territories that has led to the emergence of the Union of Burma in 1948.In a nutshell, its take on Panglong Agreement and the interpretation of Panglong Spirit as the ethnic rights of self-determination, democracy and equality of building a multi-ethnic society, meaning: genuine federal union, where there is no place for ideology of ethnocentrism.Earlier, surprisingly enough, the UWSA has taken a radical stand on Panglong Agreement, which now seems to be the Panghsang alliance line of basic political thinking, as never before in the past. In addition, it was convinced that Aung San Suu Kyi and the Military or Tatmadaw were on the same page where subjugation of the non-Bamar ethnic nationalities were concerned, according to its position paper of January 15, 2017, distributed on the eve of the Panghsang non-signatory EAOs leadership meeting last month in February.Thus, the Panghsang alliance take is to work out a new ceasefire agreement, rejecting and bypassing the NCA, and enter the peace negotiation process.Government’s rebuttalAfter weeks of silence on Panghsang’s NCA position, the government’s spokesman Zaw Htay finally made a rebuttal, when he according to 7 Day Daily report of March 25 said: “Some put out statement that the NCA is the replacement of Panglong Agreement, which is totally untrue. We have to go to 21st Century Panglong through the NCA. Sign the NCA and after that enter political negotiation, followed by signing the formation of union agreement, “Union Accord”. Then the materialization (implementation) of the Union Accord.”He further stressed: “The main thing that I wanted to say is that the negotiation of NCA between the government and the EAOs is not the end goal. The government’s goal is to achieve union agreement (Union Accord) from the 21st Century Panglong Convention.”NMSP to sign the NCALately, the New Mon State Party (NMSP), a junior partner in terms of military might but vocal and staunch supporter of the UNFC, began to wary and came up with a decision that it might be opting to sign the NCA, which it has so far refused to do so, toeing the UNFC’s line of all-inclusive signing of it by all EAOs.Recently, Mon political parties, monks and members of civil society in the southeastern state are urging the NMSP, a Mon ethnic armed group, to sign NCA.“At first, it was about signing together with the members of the Northern Alliance such as the KIA [Kachin Independence Army], MNDAA [Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army] and TNLA [Ta’ang National Liberation Army] — as all-inclusive,” said Mon National Party Central Executive Committee member Nai San Hlaing, who attended a meeting on March 22 in Moulmein involving representatives from the NMSP, political parties and civil society organizations, according to the report of DVB on March 23.“However, the [Burma Army] commander-in-chief doesn’t accept them [members of the Northern Alliance] … and it cannot be all inclusive. Because the New Mon State Party is a comparatively small organization, it is advised to sign the NCA,” he elaborated further.Furthermore, NMSP spokesman Nai Win Hla on March 22 told the media that its central committee members have decided to go the way of NCA.He said: “As (some of) the groups that have been waiting for all-inclusive participation (of all the EAOs) opinion changed to opt for approach that is not NCA, we also have to review (our position). We will go according to the NCA line. Since we have different line of approach, it is impossible to go together and that has changed the stance and opinion (of all-inclusiveness participation).”However, attempts by media to contact the NMSP spokesperson to discuss the armed group’s thinking on the issue were said to be unsuccessful.Thus, the rationalization of opting to sign the NCA seems to be based on the fact of the Panghsang decision not to sign the NCA and instead to tread a new alternative approach, which in turn makes the commitment of the remaining EAOs within the UNFC clinging to all-inclusive participation demand meaningless.What about the UNFC’s 9 point proposal?And with the bargaining power of the UNFC on the wane, due to the KIO and SSPP abandoning the ethnic alliance mother organization, the doubtfulness of whether the remaining members of the UNFC would be able to cut a better deal regarding its 9 point proposal become apparent.Particularly, it is questionable if the number one nationwide ceasefire declaration of the Tatmadaw within 24 hours, followed by the UNFC members’ ceasefire announcement within 48 hours; the number three, tripartite dialogue composition – government, parliament, military; EAOs; and political parties – on all level of the peace process talks; the number six, formation of military Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) with representatives from the government, EAOs and international figures acceptable to both parties; and number seven, formation of a neutral, enforcement tribunal for NCA involving domestic and international law experts and judges that are acceptable to both parties; would be heeded by the government that has earlier indicated that they are in agreement principally.In a logical sense, since the NMSP is already committed to tread the part of the NCA from the outset, there is no incentive left for the government to yield to the UNFC demand anymore. To put it differently, the NMSP is going to sign anyway.OutlookFor now, the NMSP has officially haven’t concretely take up the position in relation to the signing of the NCA. Likewise, the KIO and SSPP haven’t also make any official statement, saying that they still have to call central Committee meeting to come up with an official decision on the issue.Looking at the situation, the government-military side could boost its peace process approach for any additional party signing the NCA, but whether the UNFC members that are left could make any progress on its 9 point proposal is also an open question, as it has no more bargaining chip left to swing the government-military establishment, to make the peace process more equal and balance in creating a level playing-field, which is basically the aim.From the point of the Panghsang and northern alliance, the war in the north of the country would likely go on and their demand for a new ceasefire deal leading to a new peace process looks quite remote. At the most, the intensity of the war in the north could deescalate, depending on how China’s mediation and pressure are going to work out on both warring parties.The recent China’s closing of one of the MNDAA banking account and directive to disarm Kokang people entering China that might be armed, giving incentive even to buy the weapons, could be seen as a good will message to the Burmese government and at the same time pressuring the MNDAA.Inside sources, although as yet officially unconfirmed, according to the UWSA information department on March 26 translation, regarding the Minutes of the March 14 meeting between Sun Guoxiang, Special Envoy of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, and the UWSA wrote that the MNDAA is solely responsible for the recent Kokang conflict; urgently demand MNDAA’s unilateral ceasefire announcement; requested the UWSA to release a position statement as well as to mediate and stop the conflicts; mentioned Aung San Suu Kyi’s repeatedly stressing of an inclusive peace process and the Tatmadaw supportive attitude in the peace process; suggested signing the NCA would be beneficial to all stakeholders including all the EAOs; and finally, urged the UWSA to sign the NCA, while keeping reservations on some terms.As it is, the UNFC most likely is programmed to disintegrate, the war in the north would continue, the peace process or 21st Century Panglong Conference would move further on with partial ceasefire arrangement, without ever been all-inclusive, if there is no radical change in the current prevailing political situation and atmosphere.Meanwhile, the Chinese would continue to play the role of a mediator without much success, while the West, particularly the European Union would continue to fund the peace process, dubbed peace industrial complex by some disgruntled Burma observers and watchers.As for the United States, it would continue to be in the waiting mode, until the Trump administration decided to do something on Burma, as it is still more consumed by pressing issues in the home front.But while stakeholders continue to angle and re-position themselves with intensive political maneuvering, in an attempt to out do one another, one political outfall is programmed to take place, which is the disintegration of the UNFC.The NMSP has now started the first move and it may be only a matter of time, before the KNPP chip in to the signing of NCA, that would spell the end of UNFC as a formidable ethnic front, repeating the disintegration of National Democratic Front (NDF) and the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), its predecessor organizations.It might be history is repeating itself.

He further stressed: “The main thing that I wanted to say is that the negotiation of NCA between the government and the EAOs is not the end goal. The government’s goal is to achieve union agreement (Union Accord) from the 21st Century Panglong Convention.”
NMSP to sign the NCA
Lately, the New Mon State Party (NMSP), a junior partner in terms of military might but vocal and staunch supporter of the UNFC, began to wary and came up with a decision that it might be opting to sign the NCA, which it has so far refused to do so, toeing the UNFC’s line of all-inclusive signing of it by all EAOs.
Recently, Mon political parties, monks and members of civil society in the southeastern state are urging the NMSP, a Mon ethnic armed group, to sign NCA.
“At first, it was about signing together with the members of the Northern Alliance such as the KIA [Kachin Independence Army], MNDAA [Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army] and TNLA [Ta’ang National Liberation Army] — as all-inclusive,” said Mon National Party Central Executive Committee member Nai San Hlaing, who attended a meeting on March 22 in Moulmein involving representatives from the NMSP, political parties and civil society organizations, according to the report of DVB on March 23.
“However, the [Burma Army] commander-in-chief doesn’t accept them [members of the Northern Alliance] … and it cannot be all inclusive. Because the New Mon State Party is a comparatively small organization, it is advised to sign the NCA,” he elaborated further.
Furthermore, NMSP spokesman Nai Win Hla on March 22 told the media that its central committee members have decided to go the way of NCA.
He said: “As (some of) the groups that have been waiting for all-inclusive participation (of all the EAOs) opinion changed to opt for approach that is not NCA, we also have to review (our position). We will go according to the NCA line. Since we have different line of approach, it is impossible to go together and that has changed the stance and opinion (of all-inclusiveness participation).”
However, attempts by media to contact the NMSP spokesperson to discuss the armed group’s thinking on the issue were said to be unsuccessful.
Thus, the rationalization of opting to sign the NCA seems to be based on the fact of the Panghsang decision not to sign the NCA and instead to tread a new alternative approach, which in turn makes the commitment of the remaining EAOs within the UNFC clinging to all-inclusive participation demand meaningless.
What about the UNFC’s 9 point proposal?
And with the bargaining power of the UNFC on the wane, due to the KIO and SSPP abandoning the ethnic alliance mother organization, the doubtfulness of whether the remaining members of the UNFC would be able to cut a better deal regarding its 9 point proposal become apparent.
Particularly, it is questionable if the number one nationwide ceasefire declaration of the Tatmadaw within 24 hours, followed by the UNFC members’ ceasefire announcement within 48 hours; the number three, tripartite dialogue composition – government, parliament, military; EAOs; and political parties – on all level of the peace process talks; the number six, formation of military Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) with representatives from the government, EAOs and international figures acceptable to both parties; and number seven, formation of a neutral, enforcement tribunal for NCA involving domestic and international law experts and judges that are acceptable to both parties; would be heeded by the government that has earlier indicated that they are in agreement principally.
In a logical sense, since the NMSP is already committed to tread the part of the NCA from the outset, there is no incentive left for the government to yield to the UNFC demand anymore. To put it differently, the NMSP is going to sign anyway.
Outlook
For now, the NMSP has officially haven’t concretely take up the position in relation to the signing of the NCA. Likewise, the KIO and SSPP haven’t also make any official statement, saying that they still have to call central Committee meeting to come up with an official decision on the issue.
Looking at the situation, the government-military side could boost its peace process approach for any additional party signing the NCA, but whether the UNFC members that are left could make any progress on its 9 point proposal is also an open question, as it has no more bargaining chip left to swing the government-military establishment, to make the peace process more equal and balance in creating a level playing-field, which is basically the aim.
From the point of the Panghsang and northern alliance, the war in the north of the country would likely go on and their demand for a new ceasefire deal leading to a new peace process looks quite remote. At the most, the intensity of the war in the north could deescalate, depending on how China’s mediation and pressure are going to work out on both warring parties.
The recent China’s closing of one of the MNDAA banking account and directive to disarm Kokang people entering China that might be armed, giving incentive even to buy the weapons, could be seen as a good will message to the Burmese government and at the same time pressuring the MNDAA.
Inside sources, although as yet officially unconfirmed, according to the UWSA information department on March 26 translation, regarding the Minutes of the March 14 meeting between Sun Guoxiang, Special Envoy of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, and the UWSA wrote that the MNDAA is solely responsible for the recent Kokang conflict; urgently demand MNDAA’s unilateral ceasefire announcement; requested the UWSA to release a position statement as well as to mediate and stop the conflicts; mentioned Aung San Suu Kyi’s repeatedly stressing of an inclusive peace process and the Tatmadaw supportive attitude in the peace process; suggested signing the NCA would be beneficial to all stakeholders including all the EAOs; and finally, urged the UWSA to sign the NCA, while keeping reservations on some terms.
As it is, the UNFC most likely is programmed to disintegrate, the war in the north would continue, the peace process or 21st Century Panglong Conference would move further on with partial ceasefire arrangement, without ever been all-inclusive, if there is no radical change in the current prevailing political situation and atmosphere.
Meanwhile, the Chinese would continue to play the role of a mediator without much success, while the West, particularly the European Union would continue to fund the peace process, dubbed peace industrial complex by some disgruntled Burma observers and watchers.
As for the United States, it would continue to be in the waiting mode, until the Trump administration decided to do something on Burma, as it is still more consumed by pressing issues in the home front.
But while stakeholders continue to angle and re-position themselves with intensive political maneuvering, in an attempt to out do one another, one political outfall is programmed to take place, which is the disintegration of the UNFC.
The NMSP has now started the first move and it may be only a matter of time, before the KNPP chip in to the signing of NCA, that would spell the end of UNFC as a formidable ethnic front, repeating the disintegration of National Democratic Front (NDF) and the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), its predecessor organizations.
It might be history is repeating itself.

In a logical sense, since the NMSP is already committed to tread the part of the NCA from the outset, there is no incentive left for the government to yield to the UNFC demand anymore. To put it differently, the NMSP is going to sign anyway.
Outlook
For now, the NMSP has officially haven’t concretely take up the position in relation to the signing of the NCA. Likewise, the KIO and SSPP haven’t also make any official statement, saying that they still have to call central Committee meeting to come up with an official decision on the issue.
Looking at the situation, the government-military side could boost its peace process approach for any additional party signing the NCA, but whether the UNFC members that are left could make any progress on its 9 point proposal is also an open question, as it has no more bargaining chip left to swing the government-military establishment, to make the peace process more equal and balance in creating a level playing-field, which is basically the aim.
From the point of the Panghsang and northern alliance, the war in the north of the country would likely go on and their demand for a new ceasefire deal leading to a new peace process looks quite remote. At the most, the intensity of the war in the north could deescalate, depending on how China’s mediation and pressure are going to work out on both warring parties.
The recent China’s closing of one of the MNDAA banking account and directive to disarm Kokang people entering China that might be armed, giving incentive even to buy the weapons, could be seen as a good will message to the Burmese government and at the same time pressuring the MNDAA.
Inside sources, although as yet officially unconfirmed, according to the UWSA information department on March 26 translation, regarding the Minutes of the March 14 meeting between Sun Guoxiang, Special Envoy of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, and the UWSA wrote that the MNDAA is solely responsible for the recent Kokang conflict; urgently demand MNDAA’s unilateral ceasefire announcement; requested the UWSA to release a position statement as well as to mediate and stop the conflicts; mentioned Aung San Suu Kyi’s repeatedly stressing of an inclusive peace process and the Tatmadaw supportive attitude in the peace process; suggested signing the NCA would be beneficial to all stakeholders including all the EAOs; and finally, urged the UWSA to sign the NCA, while keeping reservations on some terms.
As it is, the UNFC most likely is programmed to disintegrate, the war in the north would continue, the peace process or 21st Century Panglong Conference would move further on with partial ceasefire arrangement, without ever been all-inclusive, if there is no radical change in the current prevailing political situation and atmosphere.
Meanwhile, the Chinese would continue to play the role of a mediator without much success, while the West, particularly the European Union would continue to fund the peace process, dubbed peace industrial complex by some disgruntled Burma observers and watchers.
As for the United States, it would continue to be in the waiting mode, until the Trump administration decided to do something on Burma, as it is still more consumed by pressing issues in the home front.
But while stakeholders continue to angle and re-position themselves with intensive political maneuvering, in an attempt to out do one another, one political outfall is programmed to take place, which is the disintegration of the UNFC.
The NMSP has now started the first move and it may be only a matter of time, before the KNPP chip in to the signing of NCA, that would spell the end of UNFC as a formidable ethnic front, repeating the disintegration of National Democratic Front (NDF) and the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), its predecessor organizations.
It might be history is repeating itself.

Human rights organization Fortify Rights has called for the unconditional release of human rights defender Khaing Myo Htun by the Myanmar government, after the activist was denied bail for the second time on Monday.

Human rights organization Fortify Rights has called for the unconditional release of human rights defender Khaing Myo Htun by the Myanmar government, after the activist was denied bail for the second time on Monday.
"The military is using the courts to target and silence another human rights defender. Khaing Myo Htun must be released immediately," Fortify Rights chief executive officer Matthew Smith said in a statement on Tuesday.
Arrested in July, Khaing Myo Htun was accused by the Myanmar army Lieutenant-Coloner Tin Naing of sedition and incitement for publishing a statement on behalf of the Arakan Libertation Party (ALP). He faces up to two year in prison, fines or both, for allegedly documenting military human rights abuses against Rakhine civilians, the statement said.
Khaing Myo Htun was the deputy information officer for the ALP, a political wing of the Arakan Liberation Army, which signed a cease-fire agreement with Myanmar authorities in 2012. Conflict between the Myanmar army and the Arakan army - another ethnic Rakhine armed group - broke out in April 2015.
Overshadowed by ongoing human rights issues against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, the statement further notes that over 1,100 civilians have been displaced by the conflict, mostly Buddhists in Buthidaung, Rathedaung and Kyauktaw townships.
Indonesia has in the past been open about its attention to the violence in Rakhine state, urging for the upholding of human rights for all people in Rakhine, as well as noting the importance of allowing access to humanitarian aid.

Title: MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報Myanmar | Armed Rohingya militants deny terrorist links | MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報

Hard-line Buddhists during a protest march against the government’s plan to give citizenship to some members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority
An armed militant group fighting Myanmar’s government on behalf of the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority has issued a statement asserting its right to self-defense and denying links to any terrorist group.
The statement, dated March 29 but released Tuesday through overseas sympathizers, is the first public announcement issued in the name of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which previously called itself the Faith Movement, or Harakah al-Yaqin. Analysts including the Brussel-based International Crisis Group say it has been carrying out armed resistance.
The statement says the group “came forward to defend, salvage and protect Rohingya community in Arakan with our best capacities as we have the legitimate right under international law to defend ourselves in line with the principle of self-defense.” Arakan is another term for Rakhine, the western state of Myanmar where most of the country’s 1 million Rohingya live.
The Rohingya face severe discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and were the targets of inter-communal violence in 2012 that killed hundreds and drove about 140,000 people — predominantly Rohingya — from their homes to camps for the internally displaced, where most remain. Most are denied citizenship because they are looked on as having migrated illegally from Bangladesh.
The statement issued 20 demands to the government for ensuring Rohingya rights.
In October last year, armed men killed nine Myanmar border guards, triggering a savage counterinsurgency sweep by the army in the Rohingya area of Rakhine. Alleged human rights abuses by the army, including rape and killing of civilians and the burning of more than 1,000 homes, caused international criticism and led to a U.N. Human Rights Council call last week for an independent international investigation.
Harakah al-Yaqin has taken credit for the killings of the border guards, according to the International Crisis Group, and the government has accused them of being terrorists.
“We do not associate with any terrorist group across the world,” the Arakan group’s statement said. “We do not commit any form of terrorism against any civilian regardless of their religious and ethnic origin as we do not subscribe to the notion of committing terrorism for our legitimate cause. “
It said the group assures “the safety and wellbeing of all ethnic communities, their places of worship and properties” in Rakhine state.Grant Peck, Bangkok,AP

A nascent Rohingya-linked armed group, which now calls itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ASRA), has called for international peacekeepers to protect the stateless persecuted Muslim minority in Myanmar’s Rakhine state.
The outfit, in a statement on Wednesday, called for the international community to take "necessary measures, including sending peacekeeping forces into Arakan (Rakhine) State".
The group, which denies any links to terrorism, added that it had acted to "defend, salvage and protect (the) Rohingya community in Arakan (Rakhine)".
"We have the legitimate right under international law to defend ourselves in line with the principle of self-defense," the statement read.
Elsewhere in the statement, ASRA said it was fighting to further Rohingya rights, including citizenship, and retrieve their "ancestral lands".
The Wednesday statement was signed by "commander-in-chief" Ata Ullah, who has appeared in several videos demanding political rights for ethnic Rohingya Muslim community.
Myanmar's government has accused the outfit of being terrorists whose leaders were trained by the Taliban, a militant group wreaking havoc in Afghanistan.
Conflict analysts at the International Crisis Group, however, have said that the outfit was born from sectarian violence that ripped Rakhine apart in 2012 and drove thousands of Rohingya Muslims into displacement camps.
ASRA was largely unknown until October 2016, when a series of attacks on Myanmar’s police border posts in northern Rakhine were claimed by the group.
The attacks sparked a fresh crackdown by Myanmar's government forces that sent thousands of Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.
Since October 2016, Myanmar’s forces have been carrying out a military crackdown in Rakhine, where the Rohingya community is mainly based.
At least 75,000 Rohingya have since fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh, according to the UN.
UN investigators, who interviewed Rohingya escapees in neighboring Bangladesh, have blamed Myanmar’s government forces for responding with a campaign of murder, gang rape and arson that they say may amount to genocide.
The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Friday agreed to send an international fact-finding mission to investigate widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture by security forces against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar’s Rakhine.
UN investigators believe security forces may have committed crimes against humanity.
Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has also rebuffed the UN probe, saying any international fact-finding mission "would do more to inflame, rather than resolve, the issues at this time."
Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's army chief, recently defended an ongoing crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine.

Myanmar has long faced criticism for its treatment of the more than one million Rohingya who live in Rakhine State.
Myanmar classifies Rohingya Muslims as stateless or non-citizens, a status which strips them of the right to education, work or social services.

Title: Myanmar Rohingya Militants Call For Peacekeeping Troops - GhanaStar
A nascent Rohingya militant group whose raids triggered a bloody crackdown by Myanmar’s army called Wednesday for international peacekeepers to protect the stateless Muslim minority.
Attacks on police border posts in northern Rakhine State in October claimed by the group, which now calls itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ASRA), sparked a crackdown by security forces that sent tens of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh.
In a statement widely shared by Rohingya activists outside of Myanmar the outfit said it had acted to “defend, salvage and protect (the) Rohingya community in Arakan (Rakhine)”.
“We have the legitimate right under international law to defend ourselves in line with the principle of self-defence,” it said.
AFP was unable to verify where the statement came from.
The group, largely unknown until October’s attacks, denied any links to terrorism, saying it was fighting to further Rohingya rights — including citizenship — and retrieve their “ancestral lands”.
It also called for the international community to take “necessary measures, including sending peacekeeping forces into Arakan State”.
The statement was signed by “commander-in-chief” Ata Ullah, who has appeared in several videos demanding political rights for Rohingya.
Myanmar’s government has accused the group of being terrorists whose leaders were backed by Middle Eastern money and trained by the Taliban.
Conflict analysts at the International Crisis Group said the outfit was born from sectarian violence that ripped Rakhine apart in 2012 and drove tens of thousands of Rohingya into displacement camps.
The minority are rejected by Myanmar’s Buddhist majority as interlopers from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.
UN investigators believe security forces have killed hundreds of Rohingya in the wake of the October attacks in a campaign so brutal it may be construed as a crime against humanity.
Last week the UN Human Rights Council agreed to dispatch a fact-finding mission to ensure “full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims”.
Myanmar’s civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi has dismissed the claims and said the probe would only “inflame” the conflict.
The Nobel laureate has faced a storm of criticism for not speaking out against the military, which ruled the country for 50 years and still controls the ministries of defence, borders and home affairs.

Title: Local Militia Expels Myanmar Internal Refugees From Land in Kachin State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
A local militia in the northern Myanmar town of Waingmaw has started clearing out refugees who have been staying on its land since 2012 when they were displaced by hostilities between ethnic rebels and the government army, villagers and a lawmaker from Kachin state said Thursday.
The militia asked half of the 70 households on its land to move elsewhere because it needs the acreage for planting crops, the villagers said.
Soldiers then used bulldozers to destroy houses and other buildings used by the refugees, they said, prompting them to seek help from a state lawmaker.
“People came to me and asked me to help them,” said parliamentarian Zakhaung Kham Yal. “I wrote a letter about their situation and sent it to the state government. I also sent copies to the state’s security and border affairs minister and the chairman of the state parliament.”
Some members of the militia told RFA that Colonel Myo Tin, Kachin state’s minister of security and border affairs, will visit the area.
More than 200 internally displaced persons comprising the 70 households have been living in Waingmaw since 2012.
The local militia led by Colonel Lasan Aung War, former intelligence chief of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), broke with the KIO and its armed wing the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in 2004 when an attempted coup forced his expulsion.
His armed faction settled in the Gwayhtu region of Waingmaw township after the group signed a cease-fire agreement with the government.
The KIA, which controls large swathes of northeastern Kachin state, has regularly engaged in hostilities with the Myanmar army since a cease-fire deal collapsed in 2011.
Last November, the KIA teamed up with three other ethnic armed groups—the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)—to form the Northern Alliance.
The alliance then launched coordinated attacks on 10 government and military targets in three townships in neighboring Shan state and along the105-mile border trade zone between Myanmar and China in retaliation for government army offensives against its soldiers.
An End to Forced Tolls
Meanwhile, soldiers from another militia in Muse township of Myanmar’s volatile northern Shan state has stopped seeking tolls from and confiscating the cell phones of drivers along Muse Road since Tuesday, a district administrator said.
“They had damaged the wheels of trucks” traveling along a major thoroughfare that heavy vehicles transporting goods for trade use to enter southwestern China, Muse district administrator Kyaw Kyaw Tun told RFA.
“They didn’t do anything to drivers, but took their money and phones,” he said, blaming Northern Alliance soldiers for harassing and stealing from truck drivers.
A spokesman for the Northern Alliance denied that soldiers from the organization were involved, and pointed a finger at government army troops instead.
“We sometimes stop buses and trucks for passengers’ security, but we never ask for money,” said Colonel Ta Aik Kyaw of the TNLA. “Government army soldiers have sometimes dressed in our [TNLA] uniforms and asked [motorists] for money.”
Kachin and Shan states are hotbeds of illegal drug and smuggling activities where ethnic rebels have engaged in periodic hostilities with the Myanmar army during the last few years.

Title: Myanmar military chief seeks China’s cooperation in forging peace in northern Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar+ 1 more
Myanmar’s military commander-in-chief on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to Myanmar to discuss the volatile situation along the border area in northern Shan state where Myanmar ethnic rebels are battling government forces, in a bid to relax relations with the neighboring country strained by the hostilities.
Senior General Min Aung Hlaing told Ambassador Hong Liang in the capital Naypyidaw that both countries must cooperate to create peace and stability in the border areas, according to an announcement by the commander-in-chief’s office.
They discussed the situation in Laukkai, capital of the area controlled by the ethnic Kokang in the northern part of Shan State and site of recent clashes between ethnic rebels and security forces.
Min Aung Hlaing also said the hostilities have hurt local residents and bilateral border trade relations with China
Hong Liang reiterated China’s call for a cessation of fighting in the area, which he said was harming peace, stability, security, and participation in the negotiations for restoring peace in Myanmar.
On March 15, leaders of the Northern Alliance—a coalition of four ethnic militias engaged in fighting in northern Shan state—met with a Chinese envoy in Kunming, capital of southwestern China’s Yunnan province, to discuss stopping deadly clashes along the border that have forced tens of thousands of Myanmar residents to flee to China.
Sun Guoxiang, China’s special envoy for Asian affairs, told the representatives from the ethnic armed groups that China would be willing to mediate negotiations between the militias and the Myanmar government.
The members of the Northern Alliance—Arakan Army (AA), Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)—launched coordinated attacks on Nov. 20 on government and military targets in northern Shan state and the 105-mile border trade zone between Myanmar and China.
China suspends ban account
In a related development, Reuters reported on Wednesday that China had suspended an account at the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) used by the MNDAA, also known as the Kokang army, to receive donations from supporters.
The MNDAA is involved in ongoing hostilities with Myanmar security forces after launching an attack on a police station, military camps, and civilian buildings on March 6 in Laukkai township in northeastern Shan State.
Dozens have been reported killed in the skirmishes that have driven more than 30,000 people to flee to safety, mostly in China where the Chinese government is housing them in refugee camps.
Calls by the Chinese government for an immediate cease-fire and the restoration of order along the border area have been ignored.
Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay praised the move and told the news agency that “stability and peace in the border area is a common interest for both sides.”
The Myanmar News Agency has reported 57 armed clashes between the MNDAA and government soldiers up to March 14.
NMSP seeks ‘political way’
Meanwhile, another ethnic armed group—the New Mon State Party (NMSP)—has changed tack in its approach to reaching a cease-fire deal with the Myanmar military, an NMSP spokesman said on Wednesday.
The NMSP did not sign the nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) with the Myanmar government that eight other ethnic militias inked in October 2015.
“The Mon people suggested that we decide to sign the government’s NCA as a political way [to resolve the hostilities with the Myanmar army],” said Naing Win Hla, adding that the organization will abandon its insistence on a peace deal with the government that includes all militias that have not signed the NCA.
The NMSP cannot participate in talks along with the AA, MNDAA, and TNLA because they have said that they will not sign the NCA and will try to reach peace through other means, he said.
The NMSP will join other ethnic armed groups that are part of the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC), an alliance of nine ethnic armed groups that did not sign the government’s NCA.

Title: Myanmar: New centre brings physical rehabilitation services to Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Yangon / Kyaing Tong (ICRC) – The first physical rehabilitation centre in Shan State has officially opened its doors in Kyaing Tong. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) invested 1.86 billion Myanmar kyats (1.3 million US dollars) to build it.
The 34-bed centre will begin operating in May with around 30 staff members. Initially it will accept residents in the Kyaing Tong township area who need replacements and repairs on below-the-knee prostheses. Once it reaches full operational capacity, it is expected to serve up to 910 patients a year, providing prostheses, orthoses, mobility devices and physiotherapy to people across Shan State who have been wounded by landmines or other weapons, or who have had an amputation following a traffic accident or health problem. The new centre will make it much easier for them to get physical rehabilitation services.
"Before, patients from eastern areas of Shan State had to travel for more than two days by bus to Mandalay or Yangon for consultations, physiotherapy or prosthesis fittings," said Jurg Montani, head of the ICRC's delegation in Myanmar.
The ICRC drew on its wealth of experience to design and oversee the construction of the centre, which was recently handed over to the Ministry of Health and Sports. It is the third largest ICRC-supported physical rehabilitation centre in the world in terms of area, after those in Kabul, Afghanistan and Myitkyina, Kachin State.
"The centre will help alleviate suffering and build up local people's experience and capacity to provide physical rehabilitation services for disabled people," said Didier Reck, head of the ICRC's physical rehabilitation programme in Myanmar.
The physical rehabilitation programme in Myanmar began in 1986 and now fully supports three physical rehabilitation centres: on in Hpa-An jointly managed with the Myanmar Red Cross, one run by the Ministry of Health and Sports at Yenanthar Hospital near Mandalay, and the large one in Myitkyina, opened in November 2016.
Myanmar is one of the countries that has been most severely affected by landmines and other unexploded ordnance, in particular in eastern and northern parts of the country where fighting is still ongoing. These deadly weapons have a major impact, not only when people are killed by accidentally stepping on them, but also on people's lives and livelihoods.
"The opening of the centre is our medium-to-long term contribution to stability in the area. It complements the emergency relief work we have been doing, especially in northern areas of Rakhine, Kachin and Shan," said Mr Montani.
The ICRC has run physical rehabilitation programmes in conflict-affected areas around the world since 1979, supporting 165 centres in 48 countries.
Take a virtual tour of the new centre.

Title: Deadly Clashes Hit Kokang Region in Myanmar's Northern Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
YANGON, MYANMAR — At least 30 people died during fighting in Laukkai Monday between Myanmar army forces and armed fighters from ethnic groups.
Tension between the central government and ethnic militias in the northern region near China's Yunnan province erupted early Monday morning. Witnesses told VOA of hearing artillery and small arms fire in Laukkai, capital of the Kokang special region and an important trading town on the Salween River, which forms Myanmar's border with China.
Officials said the attack targeted three Laukkai locations including police and military posts. At least five traffic control police and five civilians were killed. Authorities also reported finding 20 burning bodies which could not be identified. Myanmar says there were no casualties among the security forces.
Worst violence since 2015
The latest attack comes amid efforts by Myanmar's de facto leader, Noble Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, to bring all ethnic armed groups into the government-sponsored peace process through the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement. Monday's violence is among the worst to hit the Kokang region, in the northern part of Shan state, since 2015.
Aung San Suu Kyi's office blamed the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) for the attack, saying in a statement, “According to initial information, many innocent civilians including a primary school teacher … were killed because of attacks by the MNDAA armed group.”
The statement added that four police officers were taken hostage and said there was a suspicion that groups other than the MNDAA were involved.
Ta Bone Kyaw, secretary general of the Palaung State Liberation Front (PSLF) and a senior commander of its armed unit, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) told VOA the attack was carried out primarily by the MNDAA after a decision by the Northern Alliance. The group includes the MNDAA, TNLA, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), and the Arakan Army (AA). Aside from the KIA, “we were all in there,” he said.
“The fighting is along the border," he said, adding the fighting began around 1 a.m. Monday. "There was heavy fighting in two or three places."
Retaliation behind attack
An officer from the MNDAA's Division 211 told VOA the Laukkai attack was in retaliation for a recent government attack on the Moi Taik region.
Social media videos appeared to show areas of Laukkai on fire on Monday afternoon. An army source told the AFP news agency that the fighting was ongoing as darkness fell.
A Laukkai woman told VOA that artillery shelling and gunshots began around 1 a.m. The shooting continued until about 8 a.m., and the shelling until 11 a.m. or noon.
“I didn't dare move around,” she said. “I could not escape to China, because the border is closed,” she said, adding that fleeing to another location in Myanmar was just as impossible.
The Northern Alliance and government forces have clashed repeatedly in other northern areas of Shan State. Government authorities have blocked roads leaving Laukkai.
The Northern Alliance is led by the KIA, which includes the MNDAA. Members of the alliance have yet to join Myanmar's National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). Complicating matters, Myanmar's military officials refuse to speak with representatives of the MNDAA for reasons that are unclear.
Some groups missing from talks
Talks called by Aung San Suu Kyi at the end of August were attended by representatives of 17 of the 20 major ethnic groups, including the Karen, Kachin, Shan and Wa, who together make up 40 percent of the country's population. But groups involved in Monday's fighting — the Ta'ang, also known as the Palaung, the Kokang minority's MNDAA, and the AA — did not take part in those talks.
The ethnic Kokang group controlled Laukkai and the surrounding area until 2009, when the government ousted the group's leader, Phon Kyar Shin, who is also known by his Chinese name, Peng Jiasheng. In February 2015, he orchestrated attacks on Laukkai, which triggered several months of deadly clashes between government and rebel forces in the border area.

Title:  Bangkok Post - 30 dead in new fighting near Myanmar-China border
PUBLISHED : 7 Mar 2017 at 00:45
WRITER:Reuters
YANGON - Some 30 people died in clashes between ethnic rebels and Myanmar security forces in a restive area along the border with China on Monday, the government said, dealing new setbacks to leader Aung San Suu Kyi's goal of reaching peace with minorities.
Suu Kyi's nearly one-year-old government is increasingly besieged by ethnic rebels, grappling with an alliance of militias in the north and a new Rohingya insurgency rebelling against decades of persecution in the northwest of the country.
The attack came after the Nobel Peace Prize winner met a delegation of ethnic armed groups last week to convince them to take part in a major peace conference. Suu Kyi swept to power in 2015 on promises of national reconciliation and the meeting was aimed at giving fresh impetus to the stuttering peace process.
"I strongly urge all sides to come to the peace negotiating table by abandoning the armed attacks, which have caused many deaths and problems for the citizens, who are not guilty, and the residents of the area," Suu Kyi said in a statement reacting to the assault released late on Monday.
Fighters from the predominantly ethnic Chinese Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) launched a pre-dawn attack on police posts, military installations and government administrators in the capital of the northeastern Kokang region, Laukkai.
As a result, some 30 people died, including civilians and police officers. Hotels and cars were destroyed and four policemen have been taken hostage, the government said.
MNDAA is a part of the Northern Alliance - a coalition of rebel groups comprising one of Myanmar's most powerful militias, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), and two smaller groups that have been in a stand-off with the Myanmar military since clashes in the Kokang area in 2015.
Many died and tens of thousands fled the region during that fighting, which also spilled over into Chinese territory and resulted in the death of five Chinese people, angering Beijing.
Myanmar state television, MRTV, said the fighting with MNDAA was continuing at the time of Suu Kyi's statement.

Title: Local Militia Expels Myanmar Internal Refugees From Land in Kachin State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
A local militia in the northern Myanmar town of Waingmaw has started clearing out refugees who have been staying on its land since 2012 when they were displaced by hostilities between ethnic rebels and the government army, villagers and a lawmaker from Kachin state said Thursday.
The militia asked half of the 70 households on its land to move elsewhere because it needs the acreage for planting crops, the villagers said.
Soldiers then used bulldozers to destroy houses and other buildings used by the refugees, they said, prompting them to seek help from a state lawmaker.
“People came to me and asked me to help them,” said parliamentarian Zakhaung Kham Yal. “I wrote a letter about their situation and sent it to the state government. I also sent copies to the state’s security and border affairs minister and the chairman of the state parliament.”
Some members of the militia told RFA that Colonel Myo Tin, Kachin state’s minister of security and border affairs, will visit the area.
More than 200 internally displaced persons comprising the 70 households have been living in Waingmaw since 2012.
The local militia led by Colonel Lasan Aung War, former intelligence chief of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), broke with the KIO and its armed wing the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in 2004 when an attempted coup forced his expulsion.
His armed faction settled in the Gwayhtu region of Waingmaw township after the group signed a cease-fire agreement with the government.
The KIA, which controls large swathes of northeastern Kachin state, has regularly engaged in hostilities with the Myanmar army since a cease-fire deal collapsed in 2011.
Last November, the KIA teamed up with three other ethnic armed groups—the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)—to form the Northern Alliance.
The alliance then launched coordinated attacks on 10 government and military targets in three townships in neighboring Shan state and along the105-mile border trade zone between Myanmar and China in retaliation for government army offensives against its soldiers.
An End to Forced Tolls
Meanwhile, soldiers from another militia in Muse township of Myanmar’s volatile northern Shan state has stopped seeking tolls from and confiscating the cell phones of drivers along Muse Road since Tuesday, a district administrator said.
“They had damaged the wheels of trucks” traveling along a major thoroughfare that heavy vehicles transporting goods for trade use to enter southwestern China, Muse district administrator Kyaw Kyaw Tun told RFA.
“They didn’t do anything to drivers, but took their money and phones,” he said, blaming Northern Alliance soldiers for harassing and stealing from truck drivers.
A spokesman for the Northern Alliance denied that soldiers from the organization were involved, and pointed a finger at government army troops instead.
“We sometimes stop buses and trucks for passengers’ security, but we never ask for money,” said Colonel Ta Aik Kyaw of the TNLA. “Government army soldiers have sometimes dressed in our [TNLA] uniforms and asked [motorists] for money.”
Kachin and Shan states are hotbeds of illegal drug and smuggling activities where ethnic rebels have engaged in periodic hostilities with the Myanmar army during the last few years.

Title: Into Myanmar's Stalled Peace Process Steps China - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar+ 1 more
By Paul Vrieze
YANGOON, MYANMAR —
Myanmar’s government is meeting with an alliance of ethnic rebel groups this week to try to revive a peace process that has stalled after months of increased fighting in the country’s north.
The violence has evaporated early optimism about Aung San Suu Kyi’s ability to control the army and promote peace. The instability near China’s southern border has prompted it to become directly involved in the peace process.
The government and rebels are cautiously welcoming China’s support, but some analysts question whether Beijing is trying to influence the process through its links with powerful rebel groups.
Resuming talks
On Wednesday, de facto government leader Aung San Suu Kyi held the first high-level meeting since mid-October with the seven-member United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC), including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).
They discussed the rebels’ conditions for joining a delayed peace conference, signing of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), and joining a political dialogue over the creation of a federal, democratic union.
Eight out of 21 rebel groups signed the NCA in 2015, gathering praise from Western governments who supported the process. The National League for Democracy (NLD) government wants to bring all groups on board.
“Our State Counsellor is opening the door for all (rebels) who are non-signatories to … sign the NCA and to participate in the political dialogue,” said government spokesperson Zaw Htay.
But restoring the necessary trust will not be easy. Rebel groups have been angered by the NLD’s silence over the recent offensives by the army, which controls the defense and home affairs ministries under the constitution.
China involvement
Since September, the military has launched heavy attacks, including countless airstrikes, on the KIA and ethnic Ta’ang, Kokang and Rakhine rebel groups in northern Myanmar.
The four groups formed the Northern Alliance-Burma in late November and launched retaliatory attacks on Muse, a Myanmar-China border crossing with some $4 billion in annual trade. Rebels held the border town of Mong Ko for weeks and hit roads and bridges. A key demand of the groups was Chinese mediation in the peace process.
The fighting caused thousands of civilians to flee into China and prompted Beijing to call for an immediate ceasefire. China had occasionally supported the peace process since conflict erupted in northern Myanmar in 2011, but now its state media is encouraging greater involvement and China has begun hosting multiple meetings.
Since late November, Myanmar and China have held two high-level meetings in which their foreign affairs ministries and defense ministries discussed border security. In December, the four rebel groups and Myanmar officials were invited to the Yunnan Province capital Kunming, but talks fell through soon after the participants arrived.
China has since offered $3 million for peace talks, and its diplomats are urging the government and all rebels to sign an inclusive nationwide ceasefire.
Last month, Karen National Union (KNU) Chairman Mutu Say Poe became the first Karen rebel leader to visit China. He met with Special Envoy for Asian Affairs Sun Guoxiang in Kunming before traveling to KIA headquarters on the border to discuss the stalled peace process. The KNU is a NCA signatory.
Beijing welcomed
Euro-Burma Office Director Harn Yawnghwe attended the meeting and told VOA, “Sun Guoxiang made it clear that China would not intervene in Myanmar. … It will not be a judge or an arbitrator. But it would like to see peace and stability in Myanmar.”
Under these conditions the NCA signatory groups would probably accept China’s involvement, he added.
UNFC secretary Khu Oo Reh said the alliance has had no contact with China and it remains to be seen what role Beijing can play. But he added, “As we (rebels and government) don’t really trust each other, we need international involvement.”
Htay, Aung San Suu Kyi’s spokesperson, stressed the NCA process was “grown locally” but said the Myanmar leader had asked for support during an August visit to Beijing as “China is the key player to encourage all non-signatory groups to come to the table.”
But the army remains distrustful of China’s continuing links with the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the ethnic Chinese Kokang and Mong La rebels, who waged a China-backed communist insurgency until they reached ceasefires with the former junta in 1988. Observers believe the 20,000-strong UWSA obtained Chinese heavy weaponry in recent years and provides key support to other rebels.
Tom Kramer, a researcher with the Transnational Institute who studied the Wa, said the Myanmar army is reluctantly welcoming Chinese involvement because “maybe the army is now thinking that China can put pressure on the northern groups to join the NCA — that could be the calculation.”
Wa rebels reject NCA
Last week, however, the UWSA hosted six rebel groups, including the KIA, for a meeting on the peace process, and to the surprise of many observers, the Wa-led gathering rejected the NCA and called for a completely new peace process arbitrated by China.
Anthony Davis, a security analyst specializing in Myanmar, said China’s public support for the NCA represents only one side of its approach to the peace process. He argued the new demands by the increasingly assertive Wa rebels reveal a different Chinese plan altogether.
“It would be naïve to suppose that the Wa, who ultimately depend on Chinese support, are adopting a position that would fly in the face of Beijing’s long-term interests,” Davis told VOA. “There’s a good cop-bad cop routine being played out here and the endgame is not difficult to foresee: a new peace process in which Chinese rather than Western or Japanese mediation will be essential for success.”
Government spokesperson Zaw Htay said the UWSA-led demands “may complicate some issues” but would not derail the NCA process, adding that any differences with the Wa could be resolved through planned political dialogue.
