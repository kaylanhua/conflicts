AA Chief Urges Arakanese Not To Fall Into Army Trap In Rakhine

AA chief Tun Myat Naing

December 12th, 2017  |  09:21 AM  |2087 views
MYANMAR

The head of the Arakan Army (AA) has called on the Arakanese people not to let their emotions lead them to become involved in the conflict in Rahkine State.

AA chief Tun Myat Naing spoke for 20 minutes in a video posted on the AA’s Facebook page in which he described the conflict between Muslims and the Myanmar Army in Rakhine as a “political trap.” The video has attracted more than 200,000 views.

“The enemy has surrounded our Arakan land,” Tun Myat Naing said, referring to the Myanmar Army in Rakhine.“There are many conflicts in Arakan. For example, the problem of the Kalar (a derogatory term used against those of South Asian descent, and increasingly as an anti-Muslim slur) is a political trap for us. It has divided our people. We give warning to our people. This is a sensitive issue, and we should not become involved emotionally,” he said.

“Whenever there has been a conflict with the Kalar, they [the Myanmar Army] have wanted to create a split between the AA and the world. They have tried to lead us into an international trap,”he said.

Tun Myat Naing said he had warned the leaders of the AA as well not to become entangled in the “Kalar conflict.” “The Myanmar Army is the only party mixed up in this fight. They are the ones who took our land and our natural resources. They are the ones who are involved in this current conflict. But, they have tried to trap us and drag us into it as well,” he said.

The AA intends to protect the land of Arakan and the Arakanese people, but the rebel group will stay on the sidelines whenever conflict breaks out between Muslims and the Myanmar Army in Rakhine State, he said. “This has  prompted some people to criticize the AA. But we need to be careful with our political stand. They [the Myanmar army] attacked those Kalar with the intention of protecting the land for themselves and to keep it for themselves. It was not to defend our people. Our people must understand this,” Tun Myat Naing, said.

The AA chief said that some people have come to question the AA, asking why it had not returned “to protect our land.”

“For our side, we have enough armed forces to protect Buthidaung and Maungdaw even though we do not have enough to protect the whole of Arakan,” Tun Myat Naing said.

“When our AA did not get involved in the Kalar conflict, to avoid this trap, some of our people may have misunderstood our viewpoint.”

He said that some Myanmar military leaders who were also members of the government had repeatedly claimed the AA had an alliance with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Islamist group whose attacks against government outposts in August triggered the latest crisis in Rakhine.

“They do not have it in their minds to solve this conflict, which needs a political solution. They stir up trouble all the time as they do not want to solve this political conflict through political means. For our Arakanese people, we need to solve this conflict by staying united. We need to overcome this problem by working together as a unified force.”

The AA is an armed ethnic group has its origins in Rahkine State, but is based in Laiza in Kachin State. The AA established an armed force in 2011, and has said it planned to return to its homeland since 2014.

The AA has widespread support among the Arakanese despite a crackdown by the Myanmar Army that has seen dozens of people arrested and imprisoned on charges of unlawful association.

Since they were formed as an armed group the AA’s stated intention has been to return “the motherland” to the Arakan people. It has used the Paletwa region as a staging area for its operations.

Tun Myat Naing asked his Arakanese people to treat ethnic Chin people who live on “Arakan land” better despite the Chins dislike for his army’s base in Paletwa.

“Paletwa is an important territory for the AA as we have our political base there, and we can get food for out troops to survive there. It is important to avoid having conflict or arguments in the area. We should not attack ethnic Chin people who stay in Arakan. We should all stay united and stay together with them. We need to treat them like brothers. There are bad and good people in every ethnic group. The Chin who stay in Arakan do not have to be worried about their security,” he said.

Fighting between the AA and Myanmar Army broke out in Paletwa and Myeik Wa near the Indian border in the first week of November, and has continued for 40 days, according to the AA.

“Our Arakan dream is that we will take back Arakan in 2020. This message is for our people. Everyone needs to have this dream. It is important for our people to follow your duty to fight to take back your land. It will not be easy to win back our land and to build a new home. We need to do it systematically,” Tun Myat Naing said.

Myanmar rejects UN Human Rights Council resolution over Rakhine issue - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has expressed its opposition against a resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) with regard to the Rakhine issue, but pledged efforts to address the challenges of Rakhine state.
Official media on Thursday published a statement of Myanmar Permanent Representative to UN U Htin Lynn in response to a draft resolution submitted to a special session of the UNHRC on Myanmar.
The resolution tabled on Tuesday was entitled "Situation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar."
The special session of the UNHRC was held in Geneva at the request of the member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The statement said Myanmar opposes any country's specific resolution which gives rise to polarization, division and confrontation, and it does not reflect the principles of the UNHRC such as impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.
The draft resolution was focusing on a particular group of people belonging to a particular faith. The promotion and protection of human rights should be for all people of the globe irrespective of race, religion and gender, he said in the statement.
He pointed out that "some elements in the draft resolution are infringing on the state sovereignty of Myanmar. Allegation without sufficient and concrete evidence are also incorporated in the text."
"International assistance should be part of the solution, not part of the problem," he said, complaining that it fails to condemn the attacks of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army extremist terrorists launched fresh attacks on police outposts in Rakhine on Aug. 25, displacing residents from a number of areas in Rakhine state.
The statement said the Myanmar government has been exerting efforts to resolve the issue of Rakhine internally as well as through cooperation with Bangladesh.
Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement on Nov. 23 on the return of displaced Rohingya people who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar's Rakhine state.

Fighting In Northeast Picks Up At Year’s End

YANGON

Reports of deaths and injuries from artillery attacks and landmine blasts in Kachin and Shan states picked up during the past week and included three children.

On Christmas Eve, a teacher was injured in the neck and had her jaw and teeth shattered from shelling by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) on Woi Chyai village, near Laiza, the headquarters of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO).

Laphai Kai Nan, 29, a volunteer teacher at the Munglai Hkyet camp for internally displaced people (IDP), was hit while walking home from the camp. “She is currently at the Laiza hospital and we heard that she will soon be transferred to the Man Shi hospital in China,” said Lamai Mai Mai, an ethnic Kachin activist.

KIO spokesman Colonel Naw Bu said the Tatmadaw was shelling near Laiza even though there was no fighting along the frontlines over the weekend. He told The Irrawaddy on Sunday that the attack, which came at about 9 p.m., was timed intentionally for Christmas Eve but said celebrations went ahead regardless. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the armed wing of KIO, faced a similar attack in 2012.

Those in the IDP camp “were extremely terrified and very anxious throughout the night and packed their belongings to be ready to flee at any moment,” according to a Christmas Day statement from the Joint Strategy Team, a group of local civil society groups.

The Tatmadaw had also fired a few shells near the camp, which hosts about 6,000 IDPs, on Dec. 14.

Fighting between the KIA and Tatmadaw has continued in Bamao, Mansi, Moemauk and Tanai townships in Kachin State and in Namkham, Muse and Mang Ton townships in northern Shan State.

But the recent attacks were more akin to “blind firing and planting landmines with no disciplines,” said Lamai Mai Mai. “If they had followed the rules of war, we would have fewer civilian fatalities.”

U Maung Maung Soe, a political and ethnic affairs analyst, said it showed that the government’s efforts to build peace and the Tatmadaw’s tactics were “not harmonious.”

The government has said it wanted to see peace in 2017. Instead, the fighting has intensified. The ethnic armed groups of the country’s northeast have also acquired more arms and fighters over the year than ever before, according to data by the independent Myanmar Peace Monitor.

In November, the joint forces of the KIA, TNLA, AA and MNDAA — the four members of the Northern Alliance at the time — launched an attack near the Muse trading zone and took control of a part of Mongko Township for about a week. The Tatmadaw retaliated with its air force, destroying a church and several homes.

“Clashes will not be avoided as long as there is no ceasefire because in Myanmar politics every armed group believes it needs arms to reach its goal, and as long as they cannot change their thinking military engagement is unavoidable. So we have to think of a way to find a solution,” said U Maung Maung Soe.

Each side has accused the other of attacking civilians.

On Dec. 23, a 12-year-old boy died from injuries to his abdomen after artillery shells fell on Maiyu village in Muse, northern Shan State. The artillery fire also injured three others — two men and a 3-year-old boy who lost his right leg.

In a Facebook post on Sunday, the Ministry of Home Affairs said an unidentified ethnic armed group launched the artillery attack on an area where the ethnic Shan Lon Htan militia was conducting security operations. It said the group also attacked an area about 5 miles south of Nant Phat Kar village, also in Muse.

The office of the commander-in-chief blamed the attacks on the KIA and TNLA. Both groups have denied the accusation.

Northern Shan State is home to several armed forces, including the Tatmadaw, TNLA, KIA and local militias.

Also on the 23rd, a man was injured by a landmine in Wara Zut village, Hpakant Township, in Kachin State. The Tatmadaw accused the KIA of planting the mine.

On Dec. 19, in Shan State, a primary school student died in Mong Paw Township and four others were hospitalized in Muse in landmine blasts the military blamed on the KIA and TNLA.

U Maung Maung Soe said the source of the shelling at least should not be a mystery.

“Whoever fired the artillery can be found out by a study of the shell fragments, especially in the case of Maiyu in Muse, but the government has not done anything about it,” he said.

Title: 
Russia, UN seek for renovating historical Myanmar hospital in Shan state - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation and the United Nations have reached a contribution agreement to seek feasibility for renovation and capacity improvement of a historical hospital in Taunggyi, the capital of Shan state of Myanmar.
The contribution agreement for the Sao San Htun Hospital was signed between Myanmar's foreign ministry, the Russian embassy and the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) in Yangon Monday, the official Global New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
Under the agreement, the Russian side will contribute over 187,000 U.S. dollars to conduct a feasibility study for the hospital, while UNOPS will also monitor the feasibility carried out by the hired firm and present the finding to the donor, Ministry of Health and Sports and the hospital authorities.
The hospital was named after Sao San Htun who was the hereditary chief of the Shan State of Mongpawn and Minister of Hill Regions in Myanmar's pre-independence interim government. He was a signatory to the Panglong Agreement.
On July 19, 1947, Sao San Tun, along with national hero General Aung San and other cabinet ministers, were assassinated by gunmen during a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat complex in downtown Yangon, nearly six months before Myanmar regained independence on Jan. 4, 1948.

Title: Epidemiological Study of Landmine/ERW Victims in Kachin, Kayah and Shan States, Myanmar - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Executive Summary
In Burma (the Republic of the Union of Myanmar), there is no systematic and organized victim information system (VIS) of landmine and explosive remnants of war (ERW) victims, and few studies have been conducted on the topic, in particular in Kayah, Kachin, and Northern Shan States (NSS), where most of the accidents have recently occurred. Between 2015 and 2016, casualty reports compiled by the Mine Risk Working Group (MRWG) chaired by the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) showed that the number of mine/ERW victims increased by 58% in the country, particularly in Shan and Kachin States, while the number of victims decreased in Kayin State.
Documenting victims’ profiles and risk behaviors are needed to help design victim assistance and mine risk education (MRE) programs. To collect this information, Danish Refugee Council/Danish Demining Group (DRC/DDG) conducted an epidemiological study in Kachin, Kayah, and Shan States to analyze data collected about landmines victims and accidents.

Title: MYANMAR After Pope Francis, Card Bo visits displaced Kachin
Fighting between the Myanmar military and rebels has recently resumed. More than 120,000 people live in 167 refugee camps since 2011. Despite tensions, Pope Francis’s words of peace continue to echo in the country. Catholic leaders undertake initiatives of reconciliation.
Myitkyina (AsiaNews) – Two weeks afterPope Francis’s historic apostolic visitto Myanmar, Card Charles Maung Bo, archbishop of Yangon, has started a visit to Kachin State.
The first Burmese cardinal arrived in the northern State where he will meet with internally displaced people (IDPs) living in a number of centres run by charities in Myitkyina, the state capital, and in several refugee camps set up as a result of the ongoing conflict between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).
During his visit, the pontiff repeatedly called forpeace and reconciliationin the country, urging Catholics to rejectthe logic of revengeand Church leaders to "foster unity, charity and healing in the life of this nation".”
The cardinal's visit takes place at a time that the Myanmar military is engaged in an offensive against the Kachin, a mostly Christian ethnic group. The two sides have been fighting since 2011, when fresh violence ended a ceasefire signed in 1994.
The fighting has displaced more than 120,000 people, who are now living in 167 IDP camps in Kachin State. According to local leaders, the Myanmar military army usually goes on the offensive against rebel groups in Kachin and Shan in October, when the dry season beings.
This year however, operations began late, in November, against areas controlled by the KIA in the north of the state, particularly the Tanai district. Experts believe that the military is trying to maintain a lower profile due tostrong pressure from the international communityover thehumanitarian crisis in Rakhine.
Meanwhile, the police on Wednesday raided the Myitkyina compound of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), the political arm of the KIA.
The next day, the army shelled at least four KIA positions. In the Tanai area, soldiers blocked roads leading out of town, shelling nearby mining villages and dropping leaflets from helicopters ordering people to move out these areas before May.
Kachin is rich in natural resources and the Myanmar military has a keen interest in grabbing control of these areas. Jade mining areas in Hpakant are already under army control, whilst mining areas in Tanai are controlled by the KIA.
Despite fresh tensions in the north, the words of peace of Pope Francis continue to echo in Myanmar. Civil society groups, Catholic and others, continue to express joy and pride for hosting such an important event.
"Reinvigorated in their faith, Catholics are still euphoric for the meeting with the Holy Father,” said Fr Mariano Soe Naing, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Myanmar (CBCM) speaking toAsiaNews.
“The bishops and priests have increased their efforts in their pastoral work. The pope’s words on forgiveness reached the hearts of the Kachin refugees and Card Bo’s visit represents the beginning of a new impulse in the reconciliation process.
“Moreover, the northern commander, General Nyi Swe, will welcome the cardinal at the cathedral of Myitkyina. This is an important signal because it shows that the military is willing to collaborate with the Church on the path to peace."
"The pontiff’s words were appreciated everyone in Burma,” said Mgr Raymond Sumlut Gam, bishop of Banmaw, whose diocese includes Kachin and hosts numerous displaced persons.
"The Kachin people is trying to put into practice his [the pope’s] words, which have reinforced Catholics' expectations about peace. Although there is no reconciliation at the moment, the parties in conflict are trying to hold talks.
“Together with Baptist pastors, the Catholic Church is engaged in an important work of mediation between the government, the military and armed groups, through the establishment of a Committee.”
The latter has “nine members, including leaders of various religious confessions. It has called for the parties to work together to remove the landmines so that displaced people can return safely to their communities. This is an important step that, together with Card Bo’s visit, sends a signal of hope."

Title: Laiza in the spotlight: Myanmar's rebel capital digs in – and switches on | Cities | The Guardian
Trapped between the Burmese army and the Chinese border, the stronghold of the Christian Kachin people is quietly gearing up for its first film festival
Laiza is a city under siege – sort of. On one side of this remote, mountainous but important settlement in Myanmar’s breakaway Kachin state lurks the dreaded Burmese army. On the other, marking the city limits, is the Chinese border. “People are worried,” says Dau Hka, an official with the rebel Kachin Independence Army (KIA), which controls Laiza as the de factocapital of its small and shifting breakaway territory. “Everyone knows we are within shelling range.”
In theory, the Burmese army – known as the Tatmadaw – could attack the city at any moment, and in theory, Laizans would have nowhere to run. Most people aren’t officially allowed to cross the border into China.
The reality, though, is more complicated. For nearly 60 years the KIA has fought the Burmese government for control of Kachin state, with the goal of establishing an autonomous homeland for the Kachin people, a tiny Christian minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. They have been surprisingly effective, in part because the region’s difficult terrain and complicated geopolitics – the Chinese are major investors in Kachin state and support both sides – discourage the Burmese army from waging all-out war. Instead, the Tatmadaw has settled for spectacular, if sporadic, acts of violence. It launched an offensive on the rebel territories five years ago this month, with air strikes hitting Laiza on Christmas Eve 2012.

Since the last peace agreement broke, in 2011, it hasbombarded the city multiple times, killing dozens and terrorising the population. But even as the shells have rained down and refugees have massed on its outskirts, Laiza continues to evolve into an important political and cultural centre.
Laiza is one of the few places in Myanmar where the Kachin can practise their culture freely: studying, worshipping and publishing in their own language. Visit Laiza after spending time in anywhere else in the country, and the first thing you notice (or maybe the second, after all the churches) is the street signs. They’re in Jingpho, which is banned elsewhere. Laiza has a Jingpho-language newspaper, television and radio stations, and even a book publisher.

Meanwhile, the Chinese authorities have mostly turned a blind eye as people travel across the border to work and trade. (Indeed, the local economy depends on their forbearance.) Until recently it was relatively easy to travel to Laiza from the government-controlled areas, too: during the school breaks, many young Kachin made the pilgrimage to Laiza to volunteer with local schools and NGOs, and train as recruits with the KIA.

Until the mid-1990s, Laiza was just another Kachin village in the rugged borderlands of north-eastern Burma. The KIA maintained a strategic military post in the area, and when it signed a peace agreement with the government in 1994, moved its headquarters to Laiza. The rebel group set about establishing the rudiments of a livable city, creating public utilities and building hospitals, schools and hotels. Kachin from all over the region moved in. The population ballooned, until fighting broke out again. Laiza has since become a powerful symbol of Kachin’s political and cultural aspirations – and a high-profile target for Burmese attacks.

In 2013, the Burmese military shelled Laiza. A resident captured nine harrowing minutes of the attack on video.
For Laizans, security remains the most pressing civic issue. With no peace agreement in sight and the Burmese military intensifying its attacks, people have little choice but to put their faith in themoderating influenceof the Chinese government. But this comes at a price, too: Beijingdoesn’t want to see the conflict resolved too neatly, lest it lose its leverage with both sides. China wants Kachin support as it continues to push for a major hydroelectric project that would flood large swaths of Kachin state. This, ironically, is one area where the Kachin people and Burmese government actually share a common interest: the government suspended the project in 2011 out of concern that it would harm livelihoods and biodiversity downstream.

With the election of Aung Sang Suu Kyi’s civilian government in 2015, there was hope among Kachin that another peace agreement might move self-determination closer. But the Burmese army, not the government, has dominated the peace talks. Emboldened by a public that seems to haveno appetite for compromise with minority groups, the military insists on total disarmament of rebel groups – even as it continues to attack KIA positions and gobble up territory around Laiza.
While the Tatmadaw and the Chinese ponder their next moves, life goes on in Laiza. The city is gearing up for itsfirst ever photo and film festivalthis January. The theme is the global refugee crisis, and it’s hoped the festival will focus international attention on the situation here and beyond. It’s also an opportunity to celebrate the city and all that has been accomplished in just a few years.
The Instagram feedEveryday Kachinpublishes slice-of-life photos from Laiza and across Kachin State. For regular, in-depth coverage of the Kachin conflict,the Irrawaddyis your best bet. TheFree Burma Rangers, a humanitarian group that works closely with the KIA and other rebel groups, is a good source for current, if partisan, reports from the frontlines.

Title: Heavy fighting erupts between Tatmadaw, KIA in Tanai | Burma News International
Burma News International (BNI) is a network of 15 independent media and news organizations based in and around Burma
Clashes between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Tatmadaw broke out again in Kachin State’s Tanai township on November 28, according to the KIA.
“It was a fierce ground battle. They fired heavy weapons [at the KIA],” said Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) information officer Colonel Naw Bu.
The KIA said the fighting broke out after the Tatmadaw encroached into an area ten miles from Tanai controlled by the Kachin armed group’s 14th battalion, which falls under the its second brigade.
“The fighting lasted nearly the whole day from 6:30 am to the evening,” Col. Naw Bu said.Hostilities between the KIA and the Tatmadaw has flared since June, when an fighting forced over 1000 local residents to flee, The Myanmar Times reported at the time.“The Tatmadaw has decided to carry out territorial clearance and launch a military offensive in the Brigade 2-area, so I believe they will continue fighting in this peak season,” Col Naw Bu said, referring to the Tatmadaw’s near-annual uptick in activity during dry season.Following the offensive in June, local authorities asked Christian religious leaders and monasteries that were sheltering displaced villagers not to open formal IDP camps, but to move affected civilians to other villages.The KIA’s Brigades 4 and 6 have also sporadically clashed with the military in northern Shan State in recent months. Since fighting resumed on November 17, ward and township administrators warned local residents to avoid traveling to rural areas, including nearby amber and gold mines.
