Title: Myanmar: Maungdaw Investigation Commission’s Report Isn’t Credible – OpEd – Eurasia Review
A Journal of Analysis and News

Location of Rakhine State in Burma / Myanmar. Source: Wikipedia Commons.
ByARNO
Arakan Rohingya National Organsation (ARNO) strongly denounces and rejects the report, dated 6 August 2017, of the Maungdaw Investigation Commission headed by Myanmar Vice-President Myint Swe, a former military general. The report is “fundamentally flawed” and devoid of truth.
We are not surprised that the government’s commission denies “crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing” against the Rohingya people, where Myanmar military and security forces were the perpetrators.
We reiterate that the commission lacked independence and proper mandate; its members are not impartial or competent; it fails to provide adequate and effective protection for witnesses; and it has not given any consideration to the independent expert’s recommendations. The report neither provides accountability nor reconciliation but impunity. It, in fact, is a blatant disregard of the human rights of the victims.
Under international conventions and customary international law, the government of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has primary responsibility to protect the Rohingya population; to make accountable those responsible for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing against them, and to ensure their right to effective remedy. But the commission and its report is a ploy by the Myanmar government to prevent an independent international investigation to deliver justice, truth and full reparations for the victims.
The UN Fact-Finding mission is credible alternative to highly flawed and bias Maungdaw Investigation Commission’s report and is crucial for accountability efforts. The defenceless Rohingyas should not face discrimination or violence because of their ethnic background or religious belief.
We, therefore, urge upon the international community, including the powerful countries and Myanmar’s neighbours, to reject the Maungdaw Investigation Commission’s report and put concerted pressure on the stubborn Myanmar authorities to fully cooperate with the UN mandated Fact-Finding Mission into the human rights situation in Arakan/Rakhine State, and to provide it with free and unfettered access to all the areas to which they are seeking access.
The Arakan Rohingya National Organisation (ARNO) is a Rohingya political organisation based in London, United Kingdom.

Title: Who are Rohingya Muslims and why govt wants to deport 40,000 of them? - India Today
Listen to Story
Responding to a question in Parliament on Wednesday (August 9), Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said that the government was firm on deporting about 40,000 Rohingya Muslims from the country.
As per government estimates, Rohingya's population has increased four times in the country in the last two years. In 2015, their population was estimated to have been 10,500, as per Kiren Rijiju reply in the Lok Sabha given two years ago.
In a written response, the Home Ministry informed the Rajya Sabha that the central government has directed the concerned state governments to set up task force at district levels to identify and deport the illegally staying foreign nationals.
WHO ARE ROHINGYAS?
Rohingyas are ethnic Muslims of Myanmar living in Rakhine province in the Arakan region. Following clashes between dominant Buddhist communities in Myanmar, a large number of the Rohingya Muslims were forced to leave their country beginning 2012.
The government of Myanmar does not recognize Rohingya Muslims as citizens. They are effectively stateless people since 1982 when Myanmar passed a new citizenship law. Officially, Myanmar government refused to recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic group.
In 2015, Myanmar stated that as terminology, Rohingya had "never been included among over 100 national races of Myanmar." It says that Rohingya Muslims are mainly Bengali's settling in the country illegally after Myanmar's independence in 1948 and in the aftermath of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.
On the other hand, there are some references saying that Rohingyas had settled in the Arakan region as early as 15th century. Rohingya Muslims claim that they are native of the Arakan region. The term Rohingya is said to have its origin in word Rakhanga or Roshanga. Arakan's another local name is Rohanga.
In 1799, some European writers identified Rohigya Muslims as Rooinga living in the Arakan region as different from neighboring Hindus. But, the government of Myanmar does not agree with the claims of the Rohingyas.
MIGRATION TO INDIA
Following the clashes and absence of protection from the government, the Rohingya Muslims started to flee the country in boats. Their boats kept floating in the Bay of Bengal and along the Strait of Malacca prompting journalists to give them the name of Boat People.
India being the largest neighbor of Myanmar, Rohingyas flocked to India with the hope of better livelihood and shelter as refugee. But, India does not have any specific refugee plan. So, the Rohingya Muslims, who could enter the country, started looking for jobs and settled wherever they got a source of income.
As of now, the Rohingya Muslims are, according to the Home Ministry, mostly settled in Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Andra Pradesh and Manipur. The largest number of Rohingyas is in Jammu and Kashmir government.
According to the Jammu and Kashmir government's estimate, there are around 5,700 Rohingya Muslims in the state. However, the central government says that their number could be around 10,000-11,000 if actual headcount is carried out.Responding to a question in Parliament yesterday, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said that the government was firm on deporting about 40,000 Rohingya Muslims from the country.

REFUGEES IN INDIA
The government of India has not set up any refugee camps for the Rohangiyas living in India. Interestingly, according to the central government, there are no refugee camps for Bangladeshi refugees either. But, there are 107 camps in Tamil Nadu and one in Odisha for Sri Lanka refugees.
As for the Tibetan refugees, the government has, in principle, given them political asylum but they are staying in settlements on their own in the country.
Now, that the government has made it clear that it would work for deportation of Rohingya Muslims, concerns are being raised about their safety.
Amnesty International India, in a statement issued yesterday said, "Forcing Rohingya asylum-seekers and refugees back to Myanmar would violate the international principle of non-refoulement - which is recognized in customary international law and is binding on India - that forbids states from forcibly returning people to a country where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations."Responding to a question in Parliament yesterday, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said that the government was firm on deporting about 40,000 Rohingya Muslims from the country.

Junior Interior Minister of India Sri. Kiren Rijiju.
Krishna N. Das | Reuters | New Delhi | Aug 11, 2017::India is in talks with Bangladesh and Myanmar about its plan to deport around 40,000 Rohingya Muslims it says are living in the country illegally, a government spokesman said on Friday, with state governments told to form task forces for the purpose.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since the early 1990s, with some of them then crossing over a porous border into Hindu-majority India.
New Delhi says only around 14,000 of the Rohingya living in India are registered with the UN refugee agency, making the rest illegal and liable to be sent back. India is not a signatory to UN conventions on refugees and no national law covers it.
“These things are being discussed at diplomatic level with both Bangladesh and Myanmar,” Interior Ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said.
“More clarity will emerge at an appropriate time.”
Junior Interior Minister Kiren Rijiju told parliament on Wednesday the federal government had directed state governments to “constitute task forces at district levels to identify and deport the illegally staying foreign nationals”.
Rijiju was in Myanmar recently to attend an event, although it was not clear if he discussed the Rohingya issue.

Title: Fighting in Myanmar’s Shan State Forces Hundreds to Flee to Namtu Township - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Fighting between government troops and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army in Myanmar’s war-torn northern Shan state has forced nearly 300 villagers to flee to safety in Namtu township ahead of a planned visit by the government’s human rights commission, residents afftected by the hostilities said on Wednesday.
The villagers left their homes when hostilities between the Myanmar army and the TNLA intensified near Aukmanwei village in Namhsan township in the ethnic Palaung self-administered zone, they said.
About 100 residents fled Khay Khin and Man Wel villages after artillery shells fell there, and 100 more left their homes on Wednesday, they said.
The villagers told RFA’s Myanmar Service that another 80 people were behind them as they made their way to Namtu, where they have sought shelter in a monastery.
About 400 ethnic Lisu and Kachin refugees have already sought shelter in Namtu since December 2016 because of fighting in the region between the Myanmar military and ethnic rebels.
The TNLA said seven different clashes occurred between its troops and the Myanmar army’s 77th infantry battalion on Tuesday, and there were reports that fighting also took place in Myine and Kyauk Phyu villages in Namhsan township, the online new service the Democratic Voice of Burma reported.
The government military closed off Mantong township, the other townships in the Palaung self-administered zone, after TNLA soldiers ambushed one of its convoys on Aug. 5
The TNLA has been fighting the government army and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar’s armed forces.
Rights commission postpones visit
The latest round of clashes prompted the eight-member Myanmar National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday to postpone a trip to northern Shan state to discuss prison reform and security issues, a committee member said.
The committee was scheduled to visit a Namtu refugee camp on Thursday.
“There was a major skirmish last Friday near Mantong village and sporadic clashes occurred during the weekend, so the police can't dare be responsible for our safety,” said committee member Yu Lwin Aung. “They are worried that the TNLA might do something to us, so we had to cancel our plans.”
On Tuesday, the commissioners visited orphanages and senior citizens’ homes in Lashio, the largest town in northern Shan state, and inspected prison conditions and jail cells in Thibaw, he said.
Yu Lwin Aung said there were few human rights violations at the places they visited based on what the commission members saw and heard.
He also met with three domestic journalists detained in Thibaw Prison, who have been charged under Article 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act for being involved with an “illegal” organization.
The three journalists — Lawi Weng of the online journal The Irrawaddy and Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Aung of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) — were arrested by the government military on June 26 for covering an illegal drug-burning event by the TNLA in Namhsan.
The Myanmar military accused them of having ties to the TNLA.
The journalists have been denied bail and face up to three years in prison if convicted.
After interviewing the three men separately about the case, Yu Lwin Aung said they had not broken the law according to information they provided, The Irrawaddy reported.
Yu Lwin Aung said he would submit his findings to other commission members who will collectively determine their position on the case and decide which government ministry or office they will report it to, The Irrawaddy said.

Title: Myanmar Military Closes Off Shan State Township After Ambush by Rebel Army - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
The Myanmar military has closed all entry and exit points in Mantong township in the country’s war-torn northern Shan state following an ambush by an ethnic armed group on a national army convoy, a local official said Tuesday.
It is unknown whether there were any casualties in the Aug. 5 attack in Mantong, one of the two townships in the Palaung self-administered zone overseen by the ethnic Palaung, or Ta’ang, people — a Mon–Khmer ethnic minority found in Shan state. The zone’s other township is Namhsan.
Ethnic militias, including the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), have been engaged in periodic clashes with the Myanmar military in volatile Shan state.
“Only the entry point was closed in the past few days, but today the exit points were also closed,” said Thein Zaw, a member of the Palaung Self-autonomous Administrative Committee.
“People are having difficulties because of the closures, and some cannot even leave to get their basic supplies,” he said, adding that many of Mantong’s residents work on tea plantations outside Mantong and that some must travel to other towns for medical treatment.
A Myanmar army officer from light infantry division 77, which is in charge of the town’s security, told RFA’s Myanmar Service that the soldiers do not want the closures to affect the movement of residents, but they have no other choice.
“We don’t want to restrict their movements, but they [the rebels] are taking residents as new recruits — one person from each household — and some complied out of fear,” said the officer who declined to be named.
“So it seems every house has a rebel, and they have become informers about our movements,” he said.
TNLA battalion 434 has been engaged in hostilities with the national army’s light infantry division 77 in the Palaung self-administered zone in recent days, according to information on the website of the Palaung State Liberation Front, the TNLA’s political wing.
Past clashes
The TNLA has been fighting the government army and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces.
The clashes have forced thousands of residents to flee their homes in northern Shan state and seek shelter in Buddhist monasteries.
The TNLA is also a member of the Northern Alliance of four ethnic militias that launched coordinated attacks on Nov. 20 on 10 government and military targets in Shan state. The other members of the alliance are the Arakan Army (AA), Kachin Independence Army (KIA), and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA).

Title: Tatmadaw must change its attitude to ensure fighting stops: TNLA official | Burma News International
Burma News International (BNI) is a network of 15 independent media and news organizations based in and around Burma
Fighting will not end until the Tatmadaw changes its attitude, an official from the Ta’ang National Liberation Army said over the weekend during an ethnic coalition’s summit in northern Shan State.
“If there is no dialogue and the Tatmadaw does not change its attitude, fighting will not end no matter what kind of [ceasefire] agreement has been signed. The situation is very bad. It’s very difficult to stop the civil war,” Brigadier General Tar Bone Kyaw, general secretary of the TNLA, said during an August 18-20 meeting at Pangkham, the United Wa State Army’s headquarters.
The seven-member Federal Political Negotiation Consultative Committee (FPNCC) gathered to review its political dialogue policy, which currently stipulates that the groups will only meet with government negotiators collectively.
“The problem is that the Myanmar government wants to meet the Wa [the United Wa State Army or UWSA] and the Mongla [the National Democratic Alliance Army or the NDAA] separately. As you all know, the Tatmadaw has officially said we [the TNLA, the Arakan Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army] can only meet with them and participate in the peace process after we surrender our arms, so we are in a very difficult position,” he said.
In addition to insisting meeting’s occur only with all members of the alliance present, the FPNCC has rejected the nationwide ceasefire agreement, and has vowed to forge its own path to peace.
Leaders of the United Wa State Army (UWSA), the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Arakan Army (AA) and the National Democratic Alliance Army attended the three-day meeting in Pangkham.

Title: Myanmar Army Reopens Shan State Township, Continues Search For Attackers - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Vehicles trapped in Mantong township for five days were able to leave the area in battle-scarred northern Shan state on Thursday after the Myanmar military reopened roads following an ambush by an ethnic armed group on one of its convoys, a local politician said.
The military closed off all entry and exit points to the township after the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) attacked one of its convoys on Aug. 5, prohibiting residents and visitors from coming into and going out of Mantong.
Mantong is one of two townships in the Palaung self-administered zone overseen by the ethnic Palaung, or Ta’ang, people — a Mon–Khmer ethnic minority found in Shan state. The zone’s other township is Namhsan.
There were no reports of casualties from the attack.
“About 20 vehicles were trapped in town,” said Aik Mone, chairman of the Ta’ang National Party who lives in Mantong. “The road reopened this morning, and vehicles can travel to Namtu and Lashio from Mantong.”
Myanmar troops are meanwhile continuing their search and arrest operations for the attackers, Mantong residents told RFA’s Myanmar Service.
When the township was closed, government soldiers conducted searches at night and apprehended 10 people on Wednesday, they said.
Officials from the Palaung self-administered zone contacted Colonel Soe Moe Aung, Shan state minister for border security, who said he will talk to the government army about the arrests and ongoing clashes with the TNLA.
Thein Zaw, an official from the Palaung self-administered zone, told RFA that the Myanmar army has not yet confirmed the arrests.
TNLA battalion 434 has been engaged in hostilities with the national army’s Light Infantry Division 77 in the Palaung self-administered zone in recent days, according to information on the website of the Palaung State Liberation Front, the TNLA’s political wing.
The rebel army has been fighting the government military and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces.
UNFC meeting
In a related development, a delegation of ethnic armed groups that have not signed the NCA met with the government’s Peace Commission on Thursday at the National Peace and Reconciliation Center in Yangon for their sixth round of formal negotiations.
The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) — the umbrella organization for militias that have not signed a nationwide peace pact with the Myanmar government — discussed the nine-point proposal put forth by its Delegation for Political Negotiation (DPN), which lays out conditions under which ethnic militias will sign the NCA.
Peace Commission chairman Tin Myo Win said the parties would reach an agreement for UNFC members to sign the NCA at the current round of talks after 14 months of negotiations.
“Daw [honorific] Aung San Suu Kyi strongly believes that all delegations will sign the NCA and participate in third Panglong Peace Conference,” said Tin Myo Win, the commission’s chairman. “I also believe that both sides will build trust and work together to build a federal democratic system.”
The peace conference is a key initiative of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader who wants to end decades of civil war between the government military and rebel armies that have torn the country apart.
Two rounds of the Panglong Conference talks were held in August 2016 and May 2017. The government has yet to announce the date for the next round of talks expected later this year.
Khu Oo Reh, head of the DPN, said the government must create a fair situation for all ethnic groups if it wants those who have not signed the NCA to agree to the pact and participate in the next meeting of the government’s Panglong Conference.
Though both sides agreed on the points on March 3 and released a joint statement about them, they have yet to put them into practice, he said.
In June, four ethnic militias, including the TNLA, broke with the umbrella organization over a disagreement with the UNFC about the NCA, which they want to include all rebel groups.

Title: Myanmar Military Closes Off Shan State Township After Ambush by Rebel Army - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
The Myanmar military has closed all entry and exit points in Mantong township in the country’s war-torn northern Shan state following an ambush by an ethnic armed group on a national army convoy, a local official said Tuesday.
It is unknown whether there were any casualties in the Aug. 5 attack in Mantong, one of the two townships in the Palaung self-administered zone overseen by the ethnic Palaung, or Ta’ang, people — a Mon–Khmer ethnic minority found in Shan state. The zone’s other township is Namhsan.
Ethnic militias, including the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), have been engaged in periodic clashes with the Myanmar military in volatile Shan state.
“Only the entry point was closed in the past few days, but today the exit points were also closed,” said Thein Zaw, a member of the Palaung Self-autonomous Administrative Committee.
“People are having difficulties because of the closures, and some cannot even leave to get their basic supplies,” he said, adding that many of Mantong’s residents work on tea plantations outside Mantong and that some must travel to other towns for medical treatment.
A Myanmar army officer from light infantry division 77, which is in charge of the town’s security, told RFA’s Myanmar Service that the soldiers do not want the closures to affect the movement of residents, but they have no other choice.
“We don’t want to restrict their movements, but they [the rebels] are taking residents as new recruits — one person from each household — and some complied out of fear,” said the officer who declined to be named.
“So it seems every house has a rebel, and they have become informers about our movements,” he said.
TNLA battalion 434 has been engaged in hostilities with the national army’s light infantry division 77 in the Palaung self-administered zone in recent days, according to information on the website of the Palaung State Liberation Front, the TNLA’s political wing.
Past clashes
The TNLA has been fighting the government army and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces.
The clashes have forced thousands of residents to flee their homes in northern Shan state and seek shelter in Buddhist monasteries.
The TNLA is also a member of the Northern Alliance of four ethnic militias that launched coordinated attacks on Nov. 20 on 10 government and military targets in Shan state. The other members of the alliance are the Arakan Army (AA), Kachin Independence Army (KIA), and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA).

Title: Fighting in Myanmar’s Shan State Forces Hundreds to Flee to Namtu Township - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Fighting between government troops and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army in Myanmar’s war-torn northern Shan state has forced nearly 300 villagers to flee to safety in Namtu township ahead of a planned visit by the government’s human rights commission, residents afftected by the hostilities said on Wednesday.
The villagers left their homes when hostilities between the Myanmar army and the TNLA intensified near Aukmanwei village in Namhsan township in the ethnic Palaung self-administered zone, they said.
About 100 residents fled Khay Khin and Man Wel villages after artillery shells fell there, and 100 more left their homes on Wednesday, they said.
The villagers told RFA’s Myanmar Service that another 80 people were behind them as they made their way to Namtu, where they have sought shelter in a monastery.
About 400 ethnic Lisu and Kachin refugees have already sought shelter in Namtu since December 2016 because of fighting in the region between the Myanmar military and ethnic rebels.
The TNLA said seven different clashes occurred between its troops and the Myanmar army’s 77th infantry battalion on Tuesday, and there were reports that fighting also took place in Myine and Kyauk Phyu villages in Namhsan township, the online new service the Democratic Voice of Burma reported.
The government military closed off Mantong township, the other townships in the Palaung self-administered zone, after TNLA soldiers ambushed one of its convoys on Aug. 5
The TNLA has been fighting the government army and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar’s armed forces.
Rights commission postpones visit
The latest round of clashes prompted the eight-member Myanmar National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday to postpone a trip to northern Shan state to discuss prison reform and security issues, a committee member said.
The committee was scheduled to visit a Namtu refugee camp on Thursday.
“There was a major skirmish last Friday near Mantong village and sporadic clashes occurred during the weekend, so the police can't dare be responsible for our safety,” said committee member Yu Lwin Aung. “They are worried that the TNLA might do something to us, so we had to cancel our plans.”
On Tuesday, the commissioners visited orphanages and senior citizens’ homes in Lashio, the largest town in northern Shan state, and inspected prison conditions and jail cells in Thibaw, he said.
Yu Lwin Aung said there were few human rights violations at the places they visited based on what the commission members saw and heard.
He also met with three domestic journalists detained in Thibaw Prison, who have been charged under Article 17(1) of the Unlawful Association Act for being involved with an “illegal” organization.
The three journalists — Lawi Weng of the online journal The Irrawaddy and Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Aung of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) — were arrested by the government military on June 26 for covering an illegal drug-burning event by the TNLA in Namhsan.
The Myanmar military accused them of having ties to the TNLA.
The journalists have been denied bail and face up to three years in prison if convicted.
After interviewing the three men separately about the case, Yu Lwin Aung said they had not broken the law according to information they provided, The Irrawaddy reported.
Yu Lwin Aung said he would submit his findings to other commission members who will collectively determine their position on the case and decide which government ministry or office they will report it to, The Irrawaddy said.

Title: Myanmar Army Reopens Shan State Township, Continues Search For Attackers - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Vehicles trapped in Mantong township for five days were able to leave the area in battle-scarred northern Shan state on Thursday after the Myanmar military reopened roads following an ambush by an ethnic armed group on one of its convoys, a local politician said.
The military closed off all entry and exit points to the township after the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) attacked one of its convoys on Aug. 5, prohibiting residents and visitors from coming into and going out of Mantong.
Mantong is one of two townships in the Palaung self-administered zone overseen by the ethnic Palaung, or Ta’ang, people — a Mon–Khmer ethnic minority found in Shan state. The zone’s other township is Namhsan.
There were no reports of casualties from the attack.
“About 20 vehicles were trapped in town,” said Aik Mone, chairman of the Ta’ang National Party who lives in Mantong. “The road reopened this morning, and vehicles can travel to Namtu and Lashio from Mantong.”
Myanmar troops are meanwhile continuing their search and arrest operations for the attackers, Mantong residents told RFA’s Myanmar Service.
When the township was closed, government soldiers conducted searches at night and apprehended 10 people on Wednesday, they said.
Officials from the Palaung self-administered zone contacted Colonel Soe Moe Aung, Shan state minister for border security, who said he will talk to the government army about the arrests and ongoing clashes with the TNLA.
Thein Zaw, an official from the Palaung self-administered zone, told RFA that the Myanmar army has not yet confirmed the arrests.
TNLA battalion 434 has been engaged in hostilities with the national army’s Light Infantry Division 77 in the Palaung self-administered zone in recent days, according to information on the website of the Palaung State Liberation Front, the TNLA’s political wing.
The rebel army has been fighting the government military and another ethnic armed group — the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) — in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and eight of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The TNLA was excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces.
UNFC meeting
In a related development, a delegation of ethnic armed groups that have not signed the NCA met with the government’s Peace Commission on Thursday at the National Peace and Reconciliation Center in Yangon for their sixth round of formal negotiations.
The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) — the umbrella organization for militias that have not signed a nationwide peace pact with the Myanmar government — discussed the nine-point proposal put forth by its Delegation for Political Negotiation (DPN), which lays out conditions under which ethnic militias will sign the NCA.
Peace Commission chairman Tin Myo Win said the parties would reach an agreement for UNFC members to sign the NCA at the current round of talks after 14 months of negotiations.
“Daw [honorific] Aung San Suu Kyi strongly believes that all delegations will sign the NCA and participate in third Panglong Peace Conference,” said Tin Myo Win, the commission’s chairman. “I also believe that both sides will build trust and work together to build a federal democratic system.”
The peace conference is a key initiative of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader who wants to end decades of civil war between the government military and rebel armies that have torn the country apart.
Two rounds of the Panglong Conference talks were held in August 2016 and May 2017. The government has yet to announce the date for the next round of talks expected later this year.
Khu Oo Reh, head of the DPN, said the government must create a fair situation for all ethnic groups if it wants those who have not signed the NCA to agree to the pact and participate in the next meeting of the government’s Panglong Conference.
Though both sides agreed on the points on March 3 and released a joint statement about them, they have yet to put them into practice, he said.
In June, four ethnic militias, including the TNLA, broke with the umbrella organization over a disagreement with the UNFC about the NCA, which they want to include all rebel groups.

Title: More Than 1,000 New IDPs Reported in Kachin State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By Thu Thu Aung 14 August 2017
YANGON — More than 1,000 locals abandoned their homes and have sought refuge at Baptist and Catholic churches in Namti, Kachin State, due to fighting between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Organization/Army (KIO/A).
The displacement followed clashes near Kasung village with KIA Battalion 11 on Thursday and a reported raid by the Myanmar Army on the area the next day.
Kasung is located about 15 miles from Namti town in Mogaung Township, Kachin State.
La Mai Seng Awng, a religious leader from the Kachin Baptist Church told The Irrawaddy that 593 internally displaced people (IDPs) had come to the church seeking food and shelter.
“The IDPs arrived in Namti first,” he said. “They witnessed skirmishes between the military and the KIO that happened in the village.”
According to a statement made by a coalition of humanitarian groups in Kachin State known as the Joint Strategy Team for Humanitarian Response (JST), about 700 people arrived Namti village by Friday. Later, more than 300 villagers were assisted in escaping from Kasung and Zup Mai Yang villages by a team involving Baptist and Catholic Church leaders, the Peace Creation Group, Myanmar Red Cross Society, and Myanmar Rescue Myitkyina on Sunday, August 13.
The JST has raised concern for the safety and security of the IDPs and civilians in conflict-affected areas and school-aged children’s education.
“The danger of a flu outbreak, and [other] health concerns remains high among IDPs, especially for children and many elderly, and those with chronic diseases,” the coalition said in its statement. “It is also important to ensure that the displaced school children are provided with psychosocial support and are able to continue schooling while in Namti before they are able to return.”
On Sunday, government leaders including the minister of Kachin State’s Department of Social Welfare visited IDPs in the churches and met with the community leaders.
The Roman Catholic Church leader Lagyi La Ja told The Irrawaddy that the government had promised to arrange for the schooling of displaced children in Namti until they were able to return home.
The Roman Catholic Church in Namti is serving as a host site to more than 400 refugees.
JST secretary Gum Sha Awng told The Irrawaddy that locals’ safety should remain the “first priority” for all stakeholders in the crisis.
“We already have over 100,000 IDPs who haven’t gotten a chance to return to their original places. Their future is extremely vulnerable,” he said of those who have been displaced since a long-term ceasefire between the KIA and Myanmar Army broke down in 2011.
Church members, the JST, international NGOs, UN agencies and the government have provided emergency assistance including food, hygiene materials and blankets to the displaced.
In June, around 1,000 villagers were displaced in Kachin State’s Tanai Township, and have, as of yet, been unable to return home.
