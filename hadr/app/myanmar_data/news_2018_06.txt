Title: 14 alternative bucket list destinations that won't be swamped with tourists | London Evening Standard | Evening Standard
Lifestyle|Travel
How long is yourbucket list?
Ever since Instagram andtravelinfluencers became athing, our bucket lists have grown exponentially long. But, it seems, so have everyone else's. Traditional ‘bucket list’ locales are often overcrowded and hard to actually enjoy. Watching the sunrise over the Sun Gate at Machu Picchu with hundreds of selfie stick wielding tourists is not the life-affirming experience you signed up for.
Yet, there are a number of just-as-beautiful-but-relatively-untouched locations that are just waiting to be visited.
Below find alternative bucket list destinations you should consider for your next trip.
VisitPeru’s rainbow mountains
Vinicunca Mountain is part of the Peruvian Andes and is one of the world’s most incredible geological features. The mountain is naturally striped with a range of colours including deep maroon, gold and even lavender and blue hues – hence the nickname ‘rainbow mountains’.
Visit the Gili Islands, Indonesia
The Gili Islands are made of three islands off the coast of Bali, Indonesia. Surrounded by turquoise waters, fringed by white sand and with a must-visit turtle sanctuary, these islands are the perfect tropical getaway.
Visit a bioluminescent beach in Koh Rong, Cambodia
The seas surrounding the Cambodian island of Koh Rong are filled with glowing plankton come nightfall, leaving a trailing of twinkling lights with each wave.
Visit Bagan, Myanmar
Angkor Wat is Cambodia’s most iconic temple – but it is often flooded by tourists. Instead, take a trip to Myanmar and visit the ancient city of Bagan. Bagan is home to more than 2,000 temples that tower over the green plains.
Visit Al Ula in Saudi Arabia
While you may be faced with queues at Jordan’s ancient city of Petra, theancient city of Al Ula in Saudi Arabiais over 2,000 years old, made of mud-brick and stone houses and has only just opened its borders to tourists. This little-known alternative is a great way to see how ancient civilisations lived.
Visit Meroe in Sudan
On the banks of the Nile River, located in a desert in eastern Sudan, you will find nearly 200 ancient pyramids. These pyramids were built between 2,700 and 2,300 years ago – around a similar time to the Egyptian pyramids. While Egypt gets around 4.3 million visitors per year, Meroe only gets around 15,000 per year.
Go on a Gorilla safari in Uganda
Forgo the tourists and go on an ethical adventure instead. WithAardvark Safari’s, you can see mountain gorillas in their natural habitat.
Their seven-day gorilla safari will take you to two national parks and include accommodation, flights and national park fees and gorilla tracking permits.
From £3,864 per person;aardvarksafaris.co.uk
Bathe at the Hot Water Beach in New Zealand
Located in New Zealand’s Coromandel region, the Hot Water Beach is filled with thermal water beneath the sand where, if you dig a little at low tide, you can create your own natural hot tub.
Island hop in Croatia
On the other side of the Adriatic Sea from Italy, Croatia has a number of luxe islands to visit along its coastline. The old towns you’ll find along the way and the lush green forests and sparking water that make Croatia a perfect place to spend your summer holiday.
Swim with humpback whales in Tonga
One of the largest creatures in the world (they can grow up to 16 metres long), the humpback whale is sure to take your breath away. There are only a few places on the planet where you can swim with them in the wild and Tonga, in the South Pacific, is one of them.
Check out the Antelope Canyon in Arizona, USA
You’ve probably seen images of the Grand Canyon on your Instagram feed, but the Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon that is even more 'gram-friendly. Wind and water have carved the sandstone into a quarter of a mile's worth of photography heaven.
Visit the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi, UAE
The Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi is the largest in the United Arab Emirates and features over 82 domes and 1,000 columns. Unlike the Taj Mahal which can often be covered by smog, the Sheikh Zayed Mosque is always pristine.
Visit the Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia
The Plitvice Lakes are one of Croatia’s shining gems, filled with sixteen lakes all interlocked by a series of waterfalls. While the summer months can be busy, autumn and spring are perfect for foliage and flowers.
Hot air balloon over the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania
Spot lions, hippos, zebras and giraffes from the air while you fly across the wild plains of one of the world’s most famous national parks.

Myanmar to form independent inquiry commission on Rakhine issue - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has decided to establish an independent commission of inquiry as part of its initiative to achieve reconciliation, peace and development in the western state of Rakhine, according to an announcement of the President's Office.
Taking into consideration of the Interim Recommendations of the Advisory Board for the Committee for the Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine state, the independent commission will investigate the violation of human rights and related issues following the terror attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA).
The commission will be made up of three members including an international figure and will be assisted by national and international legal experts, the announcement said late Thursday.
The Myanmar government has reiterated that if there is violation of human rights by the security forces in Myanmar with firm evidence, investigation will be made and action will be taken according to law, objecting the attempted reference of Myanmar to the International Criminal Court to which Myanmar is not a member nor a signatory.
The ARSA extremist terrorists launched attacks on police outposts in Myanmar's Rakhine state on Aug. 25 last year, displacing a vast number of residents to neighboring Bangladesh.

Myanmar, UN agencies sign MoU on repatriation of displaced persons from Rakhine state - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Labour, Immigration and Population Ministry, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Wednesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to assist Myanmar government's repatriation process of displaced persons from Rakhine state.
Under the agreement, the UNHCR will join hands with Myanmar government in implementation of voluntary repatriation, in conducting assessments at their potential pilot project sites and will work with UNDP in preparation for recovery and resilience-based development in potential area, a statement of the Ministry of State Counsellor's Office said.
Also, the UNDP will cooperate with the government in undertaking the planning process for resilience-based recovery and development that will benefit all communities and will promote social cohesion among the communities as well as will support access to livelihoods.

Red Cross provides assistance to over 180,000 people in Myanmar's western state - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has provided humanitarian assistance to over 180,000 people across 130 villages in Myanmar's western Rakhine state since August last year, the official Global New Light of Myanmar quoted an ICRC statement as reporting Friday.
The statement of ICRC released by its resident public relations officer Corinne Ambler in Yangon Thursday said ICRC has established permanent offices in Sittway, Mrauk U and Maungtaw in Rakhine state, extending the humanitarian assistance to victims of violent terrorist attacks and natural disasters since 2012.
Ambler disclosed that ICRC President Peter Maurer is scheduled to visit Myanmar next week during which he will observe the situation of humanitarian aid given to Rakhine state and will check the red cross activities, including food administration and healthcare provided by mobile clinics as well as other need during the rainy season.
Maurer will also meet with government leadership in Nay Pyi Taw before he travels to refugee camps in Cox Bazar in Bangladesh, she added.

Title: 8-Year-Old Boy Killed in Military Shelling in Shan State, TNLA Claims - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By Lawi Weng 28 June 2018
Mon State — An 8-year-old boy was killed and seven others were wounded in shelling by the Myanmar military in Shan State’s Kutkai Township on Thursday morning, according to the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Metta Shin, a community-funded emergency response team.
They said the casualties occurred between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. when the military’s Infantry Division No. 88, stationed at a Buddhist monastery on a hill outside the victims’ village, shelled the area.
Metta Shin and the TNLA’s Information Department reported that the 8-year-old boy, Mai Ko Ko, was wounded by the shelling and died on the way to a local hospital. They said the shelling also injured the boy’s parents and 7-year-old brother, who were being treated at a military hospital in Kutkai, and a 50-year-old woman.
Major Tar Aike Kyaw, of the TNLA, told The Irrawaddy that his fighters had not engaged Myanmar military troops for the past two weeks but added that they had clashed near the village before.
“We had no troops in the village. There wasn’t even any fighting. But they shelled the village intentionally,” he said.
U Thein Aung, a township resident who lives near the village, told The Irrawaddy that an artillery shell landed in the boy’s house. He said TNLA troops had slept in the village overnight but left early in the morning before the shelling began.
The TNLA has repeatedly accused the military of shelling civilian villages in the past, sometimes fatally, and always with impunity.
Yanghee Lee, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, accused the military of violating human rights in Shan State and elsewhere while addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday.
Though hostilities between the military and Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups typically ratchet down during the rainy season, clashes do occur, and thousands of civilians in Shan and Kachin states remain displaced by previous rounds of fighting.

Title: Myanmar's Ethnic Armed Conflict: Emerging Trends in Violence - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar+ 1 more
Angshuman ChoudhuryResearcher, and Coordinator Southeast Asia Research Programme(SEARP)
2018 has been a violent year in Myanmar. Besides the crisis in the northern Rakhine State concerning the Rohingyas, the country has been engulfed by incessant fighting between the Tatmadaw (the military) and various Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) from almost all sides.
The third iteration of Myanmar's flagship biennial Union Peace Conference/21st Century Panglong Conference (21CPC)—previously scheduled for May 2018—was postponed for the fourth time, and is now rescheduled to June 2018. The 21CPC brings together representatives of the government, military, and ethnic (civilians and armed groups) for peace talks in Naypyitaw. The previous iteration took place in May 2017.
Meanwhile, developments in the January-May 2018 period point to emerging trends in the nature of armed conflict in the post October-2015 landscape in Myanmar. Overall, there were 17 broad instances and at least 60 micro incidents of violence between January-May 2018, and only eight visible instances of dialogue (albeit without settlement) between core negotiating parties. The pattern—some emergent and others a continuation of the past—reflect the complex escalation dynamics in Myanmar’s protracted civil war.
Continuity
Of all broad instances of violence, the most prominent and destabilising has been the protracted war between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) (a non-signatory to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement/NCA) in Kachin and Shan states. The raging war in its current form began in 2015 and has since continued in the form of annual winter offensives and counter-offensives by the military and the KIA respectively.
In 2018, intense clashes internally displaced over 5000 civilians and inflicted significant strategic losses on the KIA. Save for the relatively higher levels of violence this year, the still-open Kachin front reflects continuity in a long-term conflict trend. In another continuing trend, the northern front also witnessed clashes between the Tatmadaw and three other non-signatory EAOs–Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Arakan Army (AA)–who, along with the KIA, are part of the hostile Northern Alliance.
The Arakan Dilemma
May 2018 saw intense clashes between the Tatmadaw and the Rakhine-based AA in Chin state, inflicting heavy casualties on both sides and displacing nearly 1200 civilians into India's Mizoram state. For the first time in years, a conflict inside Myanmar could directly threaten India’s overseas interests: a connectivity project node in Chin's Paletwa township falls in the main conflict zone and could be at risk of sabotage.
Although clashes have subsided for now, the potential for intensification remains high. Since the killing of seven ethnic Rakhine protesters by the police in Mrauk U in January, the AA has only drawn milk from the public anger against the ‘Bamar-dominated’ union government. Even prominent Rakhine politicians have expressed sympathies for an armed struggle against the government.
This puts Naypyitaw in a delicate spot. Currently, the government’s Peace Commission is engaged in mandated talks with the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), which is the only NCA signatory and legitimate dialogue partner in the state. However, the AA's rising stature creates conditions for a bitter power struggle within the Rakhine ethnic setup, which threatens to further destabilise the already precarious situation.
The Karen Standoff
In March 2018, there were fierce clashes between the Tatmadaw and the NCA signatory Karen National Union (KNU) in Karen State's Hpapun district. Since 2017, the KNU and the Karen civil society have accused the Tatmadaw of illegally expanding its presence in Karen in violation of the NCA, and of shooting a local humanitarian worker dead. This created an escalation dynamic despite the existence of a ceasefire arrangement between the two parties, ultimately peaking in violent clashes. Finally, both sides held talks and the military decided to pull back from KNU territory.
The KNU is the most powerful and influential of all NCA signatories, and therefore a crucial dialogue partner for Naypyitaw. A fallout with the group would reverse all positive gains painstakingly accrued over the past five years in this sensitive ethnic state and more importantly, damage the NCA’s credibility as an instrument of reconciliation.
Attacks on Non-combatants
There were three instances of violence against civilian or quasi-civilian targets between February and May 2018: an unclaimed bomb blast at Yoma Bank in Lashio, Shan State, (2 civilians killed); an unclaimed triple bomb blast in Sittwe, Rakhine State (no deaths reported); and a coordinated TNLA attack against security outposts and a casino (at least 15 civilians killed).
EAO attacks on non-combatant targets have been rare, with infrequent exceptions mostly in the north where illicit financial interests often trigger inter-EAO turf wars. The last rebel attack on non-combatants was in March 2017 when the MNDAA launched an assault in Laukkai, Shan State, killing 30 people. However, with the growing intensity of military offensives, more non-ceasefire EAOs seem to be resorting to attack soft targets in urban areas with an objective of bridging the tactical asymmetry in the conflict as well as increasing the Tatmadaw’s costs for attacking rebel positions in the jungles.
Need for Stronger Ceasefire Monitoring
Besides military-rebel clashes, there were several low-grade skirmishes between various EAOs–both signatories and non-signatories–most which erupted over contested territorial blocs.
These low-intensity skirmishes, unlike military-rebel clashes, can be tackled at the ground level by strengthening the ceasefire-monitoring regime spearheaded by the Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC). This would entail further disaggregation of the existing JMC framework to the ground level by instituting more JMC-Locals involving community-level organisations, thereby allowing JMC-Union and JMC-States to process and respond to ground level complaints quicker.

Title: With Camps Slated for Closure, IDPs Fear for Safety in Home Villages - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By NYEIN NYEIN
YANGON – Internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kachin and Shan states in northern Myanmar still do not feel it is safe to return to their homes, and forcing them to do so would be a violation of their rights, women’s rights advocates said.
On June 2, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement announced plans to close IDP camps in Kachin, Shan, Karen and Rakhine states. Armed conflict in Kachin and Shan states in the country’s north, and in Karen State in the southeast, as well as communal conflict in Rakhine State in the west, has forced IDPs to take shelter in more than 100 camps throughout the country.
“We are very concerned about the consequences of the ministry’s announcement, as the IDPs will have to return to their homes, which they do not yet feel are fully safe,” said Lway Poe Ngeal, general secretary of the Women’s League of Burma (WLB). The WLB is an umbrella organization comprising 13 indigenous women’s groups. Among other activities, it gathers information on IDPs and refugees across the ethnic states.
“Only when the fighting has ceased can the villagers return, even though the situation is not completely secure,” she told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday.
Since fighting resumed between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and government forces (known as the Tatmadaw), in June 2011, more than 130,000 IDPs have taken shelter at temporary camps in both government- and KIA-controlled areas, according to figures from the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO).
According to a statement from the KIO’s News and Information Department released on June 9, 19 civilians have been killed and 47 injured by Tatmadaw shelling and landmines, and 450 villages have been destroyed during the seven years since the resumption of hostilities in Kachin and northern Shan.
The frequency of the clashes has increased in the past year. Between May 2017 and May 2018 alone there were 447 engagements between the KIA and Tatmadaw troops.
In late April, intensified fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA in Kachin’s resource-rich Tanai, Hpakant, Injangyang and Mogaung townships displaced 6,041 villagers, who are now taking shelter at Kachin Baptist and Catholic churches, as well as Buddhist monasteries, in Tanai, Myitkyina and Hpakant.
Sr. Naw Tawng, a member of a local IDP relief committee in Tanai, told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that the IDPs there are still dependent on the state government’s assistance, adding that his committee had not heard of any order from the state authorities requiring the refugees/IDPs to return to their homes.
“We were surprised by the Social Welfare Ministry’s plan, as we don’t see any arrangements being made to relocate the existing IDPs to a safer environment. Also, there has been no consultation with the local community on the ground,” said Daw Doi Bu, a Kachin lawyer and outspoken former lawmaker for the Lower House from Injangyang Township, Kachin State.
“Many of the villages were taken over by Tatmadaw troops to house their deployments, and the villagers dare not go back when there are soldiers present,” she told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday.
Besides this, some 60,000 Ta’ang (Palaung) IDPs displaced by fighting between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army South; and between the TNLA and the Tatmadaw, are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
“I am from northern Shan State and I have seen that those IDPs and refugees [displaced since 2012 by frequent fighting in the region] are not ready to go back to their homes,” Lway Poe Ngeal said.
She added that according to the Ta’ang Women’s Organization, more than 60,000 Ta’ang villagers have been displaced, and many have been forced to go back to their villages knowing there is no guarantee of their personal safety.
Many villagers who have fled the fighting — whether it is for a week, a month or three months — have no jobs or means of support in the camps, she said.
She added that these IDPs have been provided with little to no support, in terms of food or landmine awareness, either by the government or non-governmental organizations, partly due to travel restrictions imposed by the Tatmadaw.

Myanmar president calls for increased efforts on drug abuse control - Xinhua | English.news.cn

YANGON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar President U Win Myint has called for putting more efforts in drug abuse control in the wake of increasing drug abuse ruining the lives of youths in the country, Myanmar News Agency reported Friday.
Work needs to be conducted according to the UN Convention and must be done in cooperation with UN member countries, international and regional organizations, local and international non-governmental organizations and the people, U Win Myint told the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) in Nay Pyi Taw Thursday.
He stressed the need to widely communicate the danger of drugs to the public and to conduct treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts, adding that effective punishment must be made for planting, producing, possessing, transporting, distributing and trading drugs.
Myanmar has seen significant decrease in opium poppy cultivation in 2017 to 41,000 hectares which was 25 percent down from the 55,500 hectares recorded in 2015, according to the Myanmar Opium Survey 2017 launched by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in the year-end in cooperation with Myanmar.
Myanmar's eastern Shan State topped the areas with a drop of 37 percent, followed by southern Shan state with a drop of 29 percent of opium poppy cultivation reduction, but there were less than 3 or 7 percent in conflicted areas such as Northern Shan state and Kachin state.
