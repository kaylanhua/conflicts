Exclusive: 300 Rohingya 'terrorists' planning massive attack on Myanmar Army, say intel sources

Amid growing global pressure on Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis, latest intelligence report suggests that some Rohingya extremists are planning a massive attack on Myanmar Army.
Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the insurgent group of Rohingya community is believed to be plotting an attack on army soldiers with heavy weaponry. The report said that around 300 ARSA insurgents have already mingled up with Rohingyas residing in Tumbru border area in Bangladesh.
"ARSA has managed to get suicide vests and gathered big numbers of the improvised explosive devices from Jehadi groups present in Bangladesh. ARSA Commander Master Nurumia is the man behind this conspiracy," a highly-placed source in intelligence agency told Zee News.
On August 25, ARSA had issued a statement expressing grave concerns at sufferings of Rohingyas refugees in Bangladesh and urged all Rohingyas to unite under the common goal of defending the community from 'genocidal army and terrorist government in Myanmar’. The ARSA had also mentioned that its legitimate right to protect Rohingyas from persecution, ensuring their return to 'our ancestral land with safety and dignity' and urged refugees to refrain from indulging and trading in drugs, human trafficking and violence.
ARSA is recruiting people from refugees camps in Bangladesh. They are believed to be radicalising the Rohingyas and giving them weapons so fight against the Myanmar Army, said a source in Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi.
Earlier in May this year Amnesty International in his report blamed ARSA for killing 99 Hindus in Rakhine state of Myanmar.
‘A Rohingya armed group brandishing guns and swords is responsible for at least one, and potentially a second, massacre of up to 99 Hindu women,men, and children as well as additional unlawful killings and abductions of Hindu villagers in August 2017.Based on dozens of interviews conducted there and across the border in Bangladesh, as well as photographic evidence analyzed by forensic pathologists, the organization revealed how Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) fighters sowed fear among Hindus and other ethnic communities with these brutal attacks,’ Amnesty International revealed.
There are reports about Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan's has been providing all logistics and monetary support to ARSA, which has helped them to mount a counter attack on Myanmar Army. Some report says Lashkar terrorists are also reportedly involved in training ARSA terrorists in their camps.

Title: Panicked Rohingyas start leaving the only camp in Kolkata - The Siasat Daily – Archive
NEW DELHI: Fearing crackdown, detention, Rohingya refugee families begin leaving the Hardaha, the only camp on the southern outskirts of Kolkata’s West Bengal.
The development comes following the Central government advisory to states to identifyRohingyarefugees and collect their biometric details
The deportation of seven Muslim men to neighbouring Myanmar after the Supreme Court refused to intervene in the matter further added to the fear.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who chaired the 23rd meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council on October 1 in Kolkata which was attended by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said that states have been asked to identify Rohingya refugees and collect their biometric data, the report of which will be sent to Myanmar.
“They have read reports and are in fear. They have started to leave over the past two weeks. They have faced atrocities inMyanmarand say they will be killed if they return. They have told me that they would rather commit suicide here if they are forced to return than be hacked to death there. In Assam, Rohingya are detained and pushed back to Myanmar,” said Gazi, head of Desh Banchao Samajik Committee, reported The Indian Express.
More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims fledRakhinein August 2017 after Myanmar’s army launched a massive crackdown in its northern state, retaliating the attacks by insurgents, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on the country’s police posts and a military base.
A large number of Rohingya refugees, since then, have taken shelter in India and Bangladesh, and are staying in refugee camps, often raising security concerns.

In September, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina hadaccusedMyanmar of using delaying tactics to block the return of Rohingya refugees to their homes in Rakhine state. Hasina had said her nation was already responsible for its 160 million population and could not provide a permanent refuge for the Rohingyas who were forced across the border.
More than 7 lakh Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since the Myanmar Army started a crackdown in Rakhine state in August 2017 in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, an insurgent group, on police posts and a military base.
In November 2017, Bangladesh and Myanmar had agreed to begin repatriation within two months.

Title:  Bangkok Post - Focus on the cause, not just the solution for Rakhine
PUBLISHED : 29 Oct 2018 at 04:18
NEWSPAPER SECTION:News
WRITER:Laetitia van den Assum & Kobsak Chutikul
Asean's initiative to engage Myanmar on the Rakhine crisis is welcome. Since October 2016, when the first violent attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (Arsa) on border guard posts led to months-long "clearance operations" by Myanmar's armed forces, the crisis has seen more than 800,000 Rohingya Muslims seek refuge in Bangladesh. While Myanmar had every right to defend its territory, its highly militarised and indiscriminate response worsened the situation.
The foreign ministers of Thailand and Singapore, representing the incoming and outgoing chairs of Asean, are expected to visit Nay Pyi Taw soon. Press reports indicate that they hope to focus their discussions with Myanmar on the return of the refugees.
The impact of the long-standing crisis in Rakhine state is not limited to Myanmar and Bangladesh. It is a regional crisis and it is not new. For decades, Rohingya have been fleeing oppression in Myanmar where many prefer to see them as interlopers from Bangladesh rather than recognise that for many centuries Muslims, including Rohingya, have been part of the diverse ethnic and religious makeup of the coastal populations. In addition to those now in Bangladesh, hundreds of thousands find themselves in Malaysia, Pakistan, India as well as in other countries in Asia and in the Middle East. Although it is difficult to find reliable figures for the number of Rohingya remaining in Rakhine state, estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000.
The world is grateful to Bangladesh for providing sanctuary to the refugees and shouldering a very high burden. The exodus from Myanmar rapidly filled what is now the world's largest refugee camp. Many refugees have already spent more than one year in Bangladesh, trying to come to grips with the traumatic events that forced them to leave and hoping to return to their places of origin once the conditions for safe, dignified and sustainable voluntary returns are in place.
Singapore and Thailand are seeking to work with Myanmar and Bangladesh on the development of plans to repatriate Rohingya. On Oct 24 in 2017, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding expressing their preparedness to collaborate to ensure the return of the refugees. But one year on the prospects for voluntary returns remain bleak. Myanmar insists it is ready to receive them but has been unwilling to share full information about the arrangements to receive and house hundreds of thousands of returnees. It has showcased a reception centre and temporary housing for a fraction of the total number of refugees, but is yet to present its vision for a stable and prosperous Rakhine state based on equality and inclusion that are essential for a sustainable flow of returnees and prevention of recurrence. Hopefully, the engagement of Singapore and Thailand will help to speed up a proper and accountable organisational process.
It is important that the outgoing and incoming Asean chairs look carefully at the conditions needed for voluntary returns. They should heed the lessons of earlier major outflows of Rohingya to Bangladesh in 1978 and 1991. Many were ultimately returned to Myanmar against their will, where their oppression actually worsened. Conditions were already appalling but from 2012 onwards a system of ethnic segregation was moved into place. Many observers liken the conditions to apartheid. As a result, the already existing "revolving door" syndrome was reinforced: Rohingya fled again and again because the root causes of their oppression remained unaddressed.
Among those now in Bangladesh there are many who have fled their country twice or even three times. It is highly likely that they will have to flee again, unless this time the reasons for their flight are addressed and conditions are in place that guarantee them lives in dignity and harmony, based on equality of all who reside within Rakhine state's borders.
When asked what they see as important conditions, many Rohingya list freedom of movement, citizenship, equal access to health care and to education, as well as a return to their villages of origin and livelihoods. What they ask is not extraordinary. In fact, it is what people around the world look to their governments for.
An additional important condition is the scrapping of all formal and informal measures that contribute to the apartheid system which has had such profoundly negative consequences and not only in terms of entrenching inequality. It has also increased the fear of the "other" and heightened the risk of radicalisation among both Rakhine and Rohingya. If children and youth are told that others -- whom they no longer mingle with -- are the enemy, they will harbour hatred and fear against them. More young Rakhine now feel attracted to the Arakan Army, while young Rohingya are increasingly vulnerable to radicalisation by Arsa and other groups because they no longer see a future for themselves. Ironically, where both sides meet is in their rejection of the armed forces and the Union government.
The final report of the Rakhine Advisory Commission (2017), chaired by the late Kofi Annan, puts forward recommendations to surmount the political, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges facing Rakhine state. The report is clear about the importance of inclusivity and integration. It says that the state will only prosper when these conditions are met: The question should not be whether Rakhine and Muslims will live together, but rather how they will live together. Reintegration, not segregation, is the best path to long-term stability and development in Rakhine state.
The Annan report has been endorsed by the Union government of Myanmar and also by the vast majority of UN member states. Unfortunately, some voices claim that given the massive flight of Rohingya, it is no longer relevant. Nothing is further from the truth. The crisis has actually underlined its urgency. Neglecting the underlying causes of the present reality will only entrench the conflict further. Part of the present reality is that the strong focus on development as the sole and ultimate solution, will not work. The report identifies three main crises: of security, of development and of human rights. All three have to be addressed simultaneously to guarantee future stability and prosperity for all.
It would be tempting to fall back on economic development as a panacea for all ills in Rakhine state. But this temptation to "move on" should be avoided. Getting the repatriation process going, with the first sizable batch of returnees, in a safe and dignified manner is important. This is the minimum that the international community would agree as progress.
The UN have been working with the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh to find ways out of the present crisis. Asean does not have to start from scratch. The appointment of a Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General Christine Schraner Burgener, has already helped to improve communication with the government. Asean can build on this.
What is needed is an approach that combines political, developmental, security and human rights responses, to ensure that violence and inter-communal tensions are kept under control. Addressing the legitimate grievances of the population will help pave the way towards a better future for all communities in Rakhine state.

Title: Deported Rohingyas ‘will be killed very soon’, fear refugees staying in camp - The Siasat Daily – Archive
NEW DELHI: Rohingya Refugees staying in Indian camps have expressed concern over being deported to Myanmar.
Some 235 refugees staying at Kalindi Kunj camp in Delhi don’t want to return to Myanmar fearing for their lives. Speaking to ANI on Saturday, a refugee said, “We just request Indian government to let us stay here until there is peace in our country. Seven Rohingyas who were deported will be killed very soon.”
“I have been living here since 2012. I only request the government to let us live here. We have faced a lot of hardships in our country. We did not leave our country out of greed, no one really wants to leave their own nation.”

These refugees are not being provided with any amenities and live in deplorable conditions. They still do not ask for anything from the Indian government, they “just want to live here till peace prevails in our country”.
After the Central government deported seven Rohingya refugees to Myanmar on Friday, many now have refused to return to Myanmar, saying they will not rehabilitate until ‘peace is restored in their homeland’.

Title: Landmines Injure 7 Civilians in Northern Shan in October - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By Lawi Weng 29 October 2018
At least seven people have been wounded by landmines in northern Shan State in October, according to local residents, who said the devices posed a serious threat to their livelihoods, as well as their lives.
The incidents followed the deaths of three people and the wounding of seven in landmine blasts in the area in September, according to the Lashio-based Halo Trust.
Lway Ai Aww, a Halo Trust manager based in Lashio, told The Irrawaddy today that the seven landmine victims were from Namsan, Namkham, and Kyaukme townships.
The latest blasts occurred in areas where her organization’s members could not travel to educate locals about landmines due to a lack of security, she said.
Halo Trust is a U.K.-based non-governmental organization that helps landmine victims in Kachin, Shan, and Karen states.
Four landmine blasts occurred in Namsan Township this month, local people said. According to the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), all of the mines were planted by the Myanmar Army, or Tatmadaw, on public routes.
In the first incident, U Aike Nome and his wife were walking to his job on a tea plantation when he stepped on a landmine and injured his leg in Namsan Township on Oct. 18; in the second incident, a man from Namkham Township suffered serious injuries to both legs and one hand when he stepped on a mine while walking to a farm. He was treated at Namkham Hospital, according to local people; in the third blast, a couple were traveling in Namsan Township by motorbike on Oct. 24 when a landmine exploded, injuring the woman’s  right leg; in the fourth,  U Aike Lawy, 65, suffered injuries to his leg and hand when he struck a landmine in Namsan Township while on his way home after taking a girl to school at 8 a.m. on Oct. 27.
Recently, northern Shan State has seen frequent clashes between the Myanmar Army and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) including the TNLA, the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). However, clashes frequently erupt between the EAOs themselves, often between the TNLA, SSPP and Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS), especially in Namtu Township.
Determining who planted particular landmines can be difficult due the number of armed groups based in northern Shan. The Myanmar Army and ethnic rebel groups use landmines to target their enemies, but always deny it when accused by local people.
Landmines threaten the livelihoods of local people in northern Shan State, according to Lower House lawmaker Mai Win Htoo of the Ta’ang National Party.
“Many people are too afraid of landmines to go and work on the tea plantations,” said Mai Win Htoo, whose constituency is in Namsan Township.
He said the landmines that exploded recently were planted on public roads, not in areas considered conflict zones.
The government failed to educate local people about landmines, and NGOs were the only ones doing so, he said.
“It is the dry season, and many local people in Namsan go to harvest tea on the plantations,” said Mai Win Htoo. “They are afraid of landmines, but they have no food to eat, so they have to go and work at the plantations despite the danger.”
With more and more local people being wounded from landmines, the TNLA issued a statement on Oct. 26 alerting ethnic Ta’ang to be careful while traveling, as many Myanmar Army troops have been deployed to TNLA-controlled areas.
In the statement, the TNLA accused the Myanmar Army of deliberately targeting local travelers with landmines in order to create mistrust between local ethnic Ta’ang and the TNLA.
The Myanmar Army recently launched a military offensive in TNLA-controlled areas. According to the TNLA statement, the Tatmadaw has deployed not only battalions, but whole infantry divisions including Nos. 11, 66, 77,88 and 99. The Tatmadaw has even deployed some battalions from its Mandalay-based Central Command in the areas, the EAO said.
The Myanmar Army has shelled villages in an effort to drive residents out of the area, and targeted civilians with landmines, according to the TNLA.
The statement advised all people to be careful when traveling, warning that the Myanmar Army typically planted landmines near its bases and areas through which it traveled.
There were 119 landmine explosions in Myanmar last year, killing 52 people and injuring 124, according to Halo Trust. Of the 119 explosions, 45 occurred in Shan State, killing 22 people and injuring 54.
This year, from January through May, there have already been 127 landmine explosions, which have killed 23 people and injured 136. Forty-nine of the explosions were in Shan, killing nine and injuring 49.

Title: TNLA, Tatmadaw Engage in Two Days of Clashes Near Muse - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By Lawi Weng 1 October 2018
Fighting broke out between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Myanmar Army (or Tatmadaw) in Muse and Kukai townships in northern Shan State over the weekend, displacing around 200 people, according to local sources.
The fighting erupted after Tatmadaw troops tried to apprehend TNLA soldiers who were reportedly demanding money from drivers on the Muse-Lashio highway.
The TNLA reported multiple clashes on Sept. 29 in the Kung Hka, Nam Paw, Man Peng and Num Um areas of Muse Township.
The longest clash, in an area between Kung Hka and Num Um villages, lasted from 8:30 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. on Sept. 29.
According to the TNLA’s Brigadier-General Tar Phone Kyaw, both sides suffered causalities. “Some of our men were wounded; I do not have detailed information about the death toll on either side.”
The TNLA seized some military equipment from the Myanmar Army, including M60 rifles and Army uniforms.
Another clash broke out on Sept. 30 in the Tar Moe Nyar area of Kukai Township as the Tatmadaw continued to hunt members of the TNLA.
The TNLA’s demanding of money from drivers came to light after travelers on the road from Muse to Lashio posted video online showing members of the armed group stopping vehicles.
Upon learning of the activity, Myanmar Army troops set out in pursuit of the TNLA units, triggering the clashes. “The highway has been improved, making it easy for [the Tatmadaw] to reach the place where we were taxing drivers,” Brig-Gen. Tar Phone Kyaw said.
About 200 residents of Man Peng village fled as the clashes neared their homes.
The IDPs took refuge in a church in Hsenwi Township. “They arrived at our church in the evening,” said Hkun Gam, a religious leader.
Township authorities met the IDPs yesterday evening and told them to return as the fighting in the village had ceased. The IDPs went back to their village on Monday morning, Hkun Gam said.
The TNLA is active in northern Shan. It has not signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with the Myanmar Army, though peace negotiations between the government and the ethnic armed group are ongoing.

Title: Myanmar: Insurgents Destroy Poppy Fields but Extort Civilians | OCCRP

New eyewitness reports say that the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an armed insurgent group in Myanmar, is extorting money from vehicles traveling along the Mandalay-Muse highway in the war-torn Shan state in the country’s north.
The TNLA is the armed insurgent wing of the Palaung State Liberation Front (PSLF), a political organization who advocates for the self-determination of the Palaung people, an ethnic minority found in Burma’s Shan, China’s Yunnan Province and Northern Thailand.
Armed members of the group are reportedly collecting “taxes” from vehicles on the highway, depending on their size: US$64 (K100,000) for small cars and over $300 for larger vehicles.
“I’ve heard that vehicles refusing to pay the tax like mine will eventually have to pay K200,000 [$130]. I went to Nam Um village, but when I got there, I heard gunfire, so I came back here,” a truck driver told the Myanmar Times.
After paying the tax, the TNLA issues drivers a receipt. If drivers do not have a receipt, armed men at checkpoints will charge them more, according to one driver. One TNLA leader said that drivers holding receipts will not be bothered.
For decades, the TNLA, along with three other ethnic insurgent groups that comprise theNorthern Alliance, have been engaged in vicious armed conflict with the government army, officially called the Tatmadaw.
A2017 reportby Amnesty International estimates that nearly 100,000 people have been displaced by the conflict, and alleges that many actions carried out by the Tatmadaw constitute war crimes.
Armed groups in conflict areas often finance their operations through illegal trade of wood, drugs, oil or people.
Taliban, al Qaeda and its affiliates in Pakistan, Central Asia, Africa and Latin Americahave been profitingfrom illegal drug business, mostly Afghan heroin.
Islamic extremists have been helping Colombian guerrillas smuggle cocaine through Africa on its way to European consumers,Reutersreported.
Myanmar was the world’ssecond-largest opium producerin 2015, with an estimated98 percentthat year grown in Shan and Kachin states, where the conflict is the strongest.
However, a2017 reportby the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says opium production has scaled back in recent years, with a 25 percent decrease recorded in those two states between 2015 and 2017.
The TNLA isknown for its opposition to opium poppy cultivation, destroying fields, heroin refineries, and meth labs whose profits are funding the same government-backed militias the TNLA are fighting.
However, the TNLA for its part seems to be making money from various types of extortion.
Last July, more than 700 locals from the village of Kham Tengfledfollowing alleged extortion of more than $45,500 from villagers by the TNLA.
Just last monthreportssurfaced that armed groups were demanding money from trucks carrying buffaloes and cattle in the area around Kyaukme Township.
“If they [buffalo and cattle traders] refuse to or are unable to pay the money, the armed groups will shoot them,” a local from Kyaukme said.

The government failed to educate local people about landmines, and NGOs were the only ones doing so, he said.
“It is the dry season, and many local people in Namsan go to harvest tea on the plantations,” said Mai Win Htoo. “They are afraid of landmines, but they have no food to eat, so they have to go and work at the plantations despite the danger.”
With more and more local people being wounded from landmines, the TNLA issued a statement on Oct. 26 alerting ethnic Ta’ang to be careful while traveling, as many Myanmar Army troops have been deployed to TNLA-controlled areas.
In the statement, the TNLA accused the Myanmar Army of deliberately targeting local travelers with landmines in order to create mistrust between local ethnic Ta’ang and the TNLA.
The Myanmar Army recently launched a military offensive in TNLA-controlled areas. According to the TNLA statement, the Tatmadaw has deployed not only battalions, but whole infantry divisions including Nos. 11, 66, 77,88 and 99. The Tatmadaw has even deployed some battalions from its Mandalay-based Central Command in the areas, the EAO said.
The Myanmar Army has shelled villages in an effort to drive residents out of the area, and targeted civilians with landmines, according to the TNLA.
The statement advised all people to be careful when traveling, warning that the Myanmar Army typically planted landmines near its bases and areas through which it traveled.
There were 119 landmine explosions in Myanmar last year, killing 52 people and injuring 124, according to Halo Trust. Of the 119 explosions, 45 occurred in Shan State, killing 22 people and injuring 54.
This year, from January through May, there have already been 127 landmine explosions, which have killed 23 people and injured 136. Forty-nine of the explosions were in Shan, killing nine and injuring 49.

Title: Myanmar’s Ethnic Armies to Meet to Sort Out Approach to Stalled Peace Process - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
Some of the five ethnic armed groups that have not signed Myanmar’s nationwide cease-fire accord will attend talks with the committee responsible for holding political dialogue and convening peace conferences, as stakeholders in the country’s stalled peace process continue to iron out their differences, those involved said on Tuesday.
The Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) invited the United Wa State Army (UWSA), National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA), Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA), and the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP)/Karenni Army for a meeting on Nov. 1-3 at the National Reconciliation and Peace Center (NRPC) in Yangon, said Hla Maung Shwe, a member of the UPDJC’s secretariat group.
“Because this meeting will be held by a decision of the members of the UPDJC’s secretariat group, we have to hold it even if some representatives from the ethnic armed groups don’t attend,” said Hla Maung Shwe, who has been advising the government’s peace team under the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led administration.
The UPDJC’s 15-member secretariat group includes five members of the Myanmar military, government, and national parliament, as well as five representatives chosen by the ethnic armies, and five selected by political parties.
So far, only the NDAA and SSPP have confirmed their attendance, said Zaw Htay, spokesman for State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi’s office, at a press conference on Monday in the capital Naypyidaw.
Khu Nyae Yel from the KNPP’s Loikaw office told RFA’s Myanmar Service that he forwarded the invitation to the group’s central executive committee for consideration.
“I heard that the committee members are having a meeting to decide whether the KNPP will attend,” he said. “I don’t know their decision yet.”
Current fighting between KNPP troops and Myanmar forces is creating more obstacles to the nation’s peace process, said political analyst Than Soe Naing.
Colonel Naw Bu of the KIO, the political wing of the KIA which has been engaged in skirmishes with Myanmar forces in northern Myanmar’s Kachin state, said the ethnic army hasn’t yet received any instruction to attend the meeting, and that a key decision maker — KIO Vice Chairman General Gwan Maw — is traveling.
Nyi Yan, a spokesman at the UWSA’s office in Lashio in Shan state, said the Wa Army — Myanmar’s largest non-state military — would not attend the talks, state media reported.
RFA’s Myanmar Service was unable to reach him for comment.
The five invited ethnic armies are among the 11 groups that have not signed the government’s October 2015 nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA).
In the meantime, the government has invited leaders from the UWSA and KIA to a meeting on Wednesday with representatives from both the Myanmar Peace Center and the Northern Alliance, a grouping of four ethnic armies, including the KIA, that have not signed the NCA, in Kunming, capital of southwestern China’s Yunnan province.
The meetings are being held to try to overcome deadlocks in the country’s ongoing peace process.
The current government has held three formal rounds of its 21st-Century Panglong Conference since August 2016 and intends to hold three more during the remainder of 2018 and in 2019.
KNU’s participation on hold
Of the 10 armed groups that have signed the NCA, the Karen National Union (KNU) sent a letter on Oct. 27 to Aung San Suu Kyi, chairwoman of the National Reconciliation and Peace Center, saying that it is putting its participation in the talks on hold amid ongoing obstacles to the peace process.
The group cited displeasure with high-level discussions among the government, Myanmar military, and the NCA signatories that took place earlier this month to try to kick-start the country’s stalled peace process.
The participants at that meeting decided to extend dialogue to non-NCA signatories, and the ethnic armies agreed in principle to a key military demand that they fold their militias into a single national army, though they emphasized the need for further talks on integrating the various armed forces into one defense force.
But they balked at the Myanmar military’s demand that they agree never to secede from the union.
KNU Vice Chairman Padoh Saw Kwe Htoo Win told the online journalThe Irrawaddyon Tuesday that top leaders from the ethnic armies, government, and military had failed to make progress on the issues of non-secession and a single, unified army when they met for the tripartite summit in Naypyidaw on Oct. 15-16, though they did agree did agree to hold further talks.
Another NCA-signatory group, the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS)/Shan State Army-South, has said that it will not accept the Myanmar military’s conditions for non-secession and the integration of ethnic forces into the national army without a referendum on the issues in Shan state, Than Soe Naing said.
The KNU has said that it will not participate in the political dialogue framework review meeting on Nov. 1-3 in Yangon, nor in a meeting of the Peace Process Steering Team (PPST), a group comprising NCA non-signatory groups which the KNU chairs, on Nov. 5-7 in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

Title: Report: More African ivory being smuggled into China despite ban - The Standard
More African ivory is being smuggled into China from Myanmar and Beijing’s ban on trade in ivory has failed to dampen imports, a report by conservation group Save the Elephants said on Tuesday.Wildlife activists said they welcomed China’s ban this year on the ivory trade, arguing the step by a country that is the world’s largest importer and end user of tusks was vital to reducing the slaughter of the endangered species.But it has not stopped what Save the Elephants called the “prolific growth” in trading in a town in the “Golden Triangle” area, where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet at the confluence of the Ruak and Mekong Rivers, south of China.There has been a 60 percent growth in new ivory items seen for sale in the Myanmar-China border town of Mong La in the past three years and 90 percent of buyers are Chinese wishing to smuggle the ivory home, the report said.It gave no separate figures for the period since the ban was introduced..Keep ReadingChinese investors eye Kenya as new manufacturing hubJKIA-Adani deal whistleblower fears for his life after DCI visit - VIDEOWill China outdo the West in transforming Africa?Water project to benefit 1,000 households in Nandi HillsMyanmar has the world’s largest population of captive elephants, 5,000 in all, but trade in tusks at Mong La and elsewhere increasingly comes from elephants of African origin, the report said.Myanmar’s government spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment.“Demand is still very high in China ... Myanmar has over 2,000 kilometres of borderline with China which is very easy for smugglers to bring ivory across,” said researcher Lucy Vigne.She co-authored the report with Esmond Bradley-Martin, a prominent American investigator of the illegal ivory and rhino horn trade who was found dead in his home in the Kenyan capital with an unexplained stab wound in his neck in February.He had spent decades tracking the movement of animal products, mostly from Africa to markets in Asia.

Title: Burma’s Beleaguered Baptists - Christianity Today
Advancing the stories and ideas of the kingdom of God.
Lee Williams in Myitkyina
Rohingya Muslims aren’t the only religious minority under fire in Myanmar.
They drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from their homeland from 2016 to 2017. Now many of the same Burmese troops that purged southwest Myanmar have moved north to another beleaguered religious and ethnic minority: the Christian Kachin.
Thousands of Kachin have been driven out of more than 50 villages as of June 2018, adding to a tally of more than 400 villages, 300 churches, and 100 schools destroyed or damaged by soldiers since 2011, according to the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO).
Fleeing their homes and villages has not always offered the Kachin security. Myanmar’s armed forces, the Tatmadaw, have cut off humanitarian aid for scores of camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) in areas controlled by the KIO’s armed wing, the KIA. Meanwhile, Baptist and Catholic churches have stepped up to host many of the camps.

About 130,000 Kachin are displaced in Kachin state and bordering Shan state, fleeing to IDP camps since the Southeast Asian nation’s civil war rekindled after a 17-year ceasefire.
But while the Tatmadaw’s scorched-earth warfare against the Rohingya has been reported on regularly by global news outlets, awareness of similar human rights violations—rape, torture, and murder—against the Kachin has yet to become widespread. A United Nations investigation in March noted that there were “marked similarities” between the violence against the Rohingya and the Kachin.
“I understand if the secular world has no interest in us, but where is the body of Christ?” ~Layang Seng Ja
The eyes of the world turned briefly to the ethnic group during a visit to Myanmar by Pope Francis last fall, where he was welcomed by more than 7,000 Kachin. But since then many feel that the global body of Christ has ignored them.
“The Tatmadaw has forced villagers from their homes and disgraced our churches,” said Layang Seng Ja, a New Testament professor at Kachin Theological College and Seminary. “I understand if the secular world has no interest in us, but where is the body of Christ?
“We are the fruit and labor of American missionaries,” she said. “So where are the Christians?”
The atrocities against the Kachin reached a peak this spring. The Myanmar army has justified its actions, claiming that the KIA is a terrorist group and that much of the violence incurred in villages is collateral damage. But local leaders and outside religious freedom observers say the attacks on Kachin villages are also attacks on Christianity.
The Kachin people have long embraced their Christian heritage, dating back to the early 1800s when missionary Adoniram Judson came to then-Burma and translated the Bible into Burmese. He planted a number of Baptist churches, and his spiritual descendants make up much of the Kachin’s 1.2 million people.
“We don’t like to use the term ‘religious persecution’ lightly,” said Nsang Gum San, president of the Kachin Alliance, a US-based advocacy group. “But the systematic ransacking of churches certainly qualifies.” He and authorities within the Kachin Baptist Convention (KBC) say that in villages where churches have been destroyed, the Burmese have erected pagodas as Buddhist shrines.
There are more than 165 IDP camps spread across Kachin and northern Shan, most run by Baptist churches. Hkawn Nu fled to one in May. Months into her pregnancy, she did not want to leave, “but to stay meant I would have gone hungry … or been killed. All we knew was fear.”
A little over two weeks after arriving at the camp, she gave birth to a little girl. Barely two weeks old on the afternoon her mother was interviewed, the baby slept peacefully as Nu and her daughter shooed away flies. In the camps, time ticks by slowly. There is little to do but sit, sleep, and wait for a meal of rice and a thick soup.
Despite the tight living spaces, swarms of mosquitoes, and copious amounts of mud, the camps are sanctuaries to the refugees. On this day, a health fair was underway at a camp run by the Waingmaw Baptist Association (WBA); doctors and nurses examined eyes and teeth and took vital signs. The WBA has received help from groups such as World Concern and World Vision, said Hpauyu Tang Ze, director of men’s ministry.
The WBA camp, where 350 IDPs share a space the size of half a basketball court, is 1 of 8 on this side of the Ayeyarwady, Myanmar’s largest river, that houses more than 10,000 displaced villagers. One resident, Bawn Sau, explained how his family fled their village near the China border when the gunfire they heard drew too close, like thunder before lightning. “You know when you have to leave,” said the 15-year-old.
The rift between the Kachin and the national government dates back to 1948, when then-Burma gained its independence from Britain. The KIO and KIA were formed in the 1960s, after Buddhism was declared the state religion. In recent years, the Kachin, along with the Karen, Shan, Chin, Rohingya, and other ethnic minorities, have been victims of forced closures of churches and mosques as well as forced conversions to Buddhism. Many have fled en masse to neighboring Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, and India.
A ceasefire started in 1994. But tensions between the Kachin and the national government began to rise in 2008, after some proposed changes to Myanmar’s new constitution did not sit well with the KIO, said spokesman Dumsa Dau Hka. In 2011, when the Burmese army attacked the KIA and tried to put its own security forces around a KIO-controlled hydropower plant, the ceasefire fell apart, spurring a civil war.
In carrying out its current strikes, the Tatmadaw employs fighter jets, helicopters, and heavy artillery to bomb, burn, and fire at Kachin villages. While the KIA has no air force, its ground forces use AK-47s and short-range rocket launchers, said Dau Hka. “The situation is getting worse.”
For now, the refugees are adjusting to their new lives, praying for peace and harmony. Their misery is not camp life, but uncertainty of what will come next.
“What will happen to them? Where will they go? That’s the answer we’re looking for,” said Zau Rat, pastor of Jaw Masat Baptist Church, which hosts 450 IDPs—including 150 children—on the outskirts of Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state. Volunteers spend time counseling the victims, “trying to keep them focused and looking forward,” he said. “The most important thing to contribute is our time and worship.”
Across the Ayeyarwady, church bells at Maina KBC Camp ring three times a day, signaling worship. On this rainy day, a handful of teens circled for prayer just before lunch. The camp is the largest of 13 in Myitkyina, with rows of barrack-like huts with tin roofs housing 2,800 IDPs from 47 villages, said Maran Zau Lone, the camp’s self-described chief. His consistent message to the displaced: “Be patient and have faith.”
Gum San is not optimistic the displaced will be able to resettle after the “implosions” of their communities. Once a village is attacked and people are forced out, it falls under the control of the Myanmar government, which reaps the revenue from such natural resources as banana plantations and jade mines.
Another pressing issue, especially in areas once controlled by the KIA, is land mines, said the WBA’s Tang Ze. From January to May this year, 13 civilians were killed and 39 injured by land mines, according to theKachinland News.
Tang Ze said some permanent shelters are being built by the government; in June, 95 displaced families were moved from camps into low-cost housing near Waingmaw. But for most of the displaced, they wait. And wait. And wait.
Supna Hkawn Bu, who is over 100 years old, spends her days at a Catholic-run camp in the mountains. She is frail and unable to walk, and had pleaded with family to let her stay in their village devastated by an air strike in April. Her grandson carried her on his back to the camp; a photo of the two went viral on Facebook.
She is weary of the civil war that has lasted half of her life. She’s been a refugee three, maybe four times. She’s had enough. “It was really scary when I was young,” she said. “But now I just really want to go home. I don’t want to die here.”
Bob Roberts, senior pastor of NorthWood Church in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Texas, went to Myanmar in June to see the Kachin crisis firsthand. “The same army units that slaughtered and raped the Rohingya are now in Kachin state doing the same thing to the Christians, and the persecution is picking up,” he said.
Roberts is part of the Faith Coalition to Stop Genocide in Burma, which is urging the US government to impose sanctions. “Now is the time to speak up while there is hope,” he said. “After the fact is too late.”

CT offers an in-depth look at the precarious situation in which many Nigerian Christians find themselves, terrorized on two fronts between Boko Haram and nomadic Fulani herdsmen. The two Muslim groups represent two very different kinds of threats to Africa's largest Christian community. But at their core, both conflicts are about land, power, and religious identity.
