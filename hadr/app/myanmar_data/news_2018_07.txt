Despite K-Pop’s explosive global popularity, the industry faces a potential future hurdle: a lack of trainees.
A recent report by the Korea Creative Content Agency reveals a staggering decline in trainee numbers. From 2020 to 2022, the pool of trainees dropped a worrying 38.3%, falling from nearly 1,900 to just over 1,170.
This shortage isn’t just from a lack of new aspiring idols. Dropout rates among existing trainees have also risen significantly. The odds of successfully debuting have shrunk from a promising 80% in 2016 to a much less encouraging 65% in 2022. This harsh reality, coupled with the intense training process, is causing many to abandon their K-Pop dreams.
Practice rooms are empty since aspiring dancers are abandoning K-pop dreams.
Experts point to a shift in career aspirations among teenagers as a key reason. Government surveys show a dramatic decline in the “singer” career path on students’ wish lists. From ranking high in the early 2000s, “singer” has fallen out of favour with younger generations, who are increasingly drawn to the quicker success and financial rewards offered by careers like social media influencing.
While K-Pop enjoys a global boom, the industry’s future talent pipeline seems to be drying up. Efforts to recruit internationally and hold global auditions are underway, but addressing the root causes behind this decline is critical.
South Korea for the time is facing a K-pop trainee crisis.
The K-Pop industry needs to find ways to make the path to idol-dom more enticing and sustainable for aspiring stars.

An armed group blamed for attacks against the Myanmar military has said that it poses no threat to India and expressed “heartfelt appreciation” for Indian support to the Rohingya refugees.
In a statement released to the media, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) said that its struggle is to ensure the rights of the Rohingya refugees and that it is not connected to the Islamic State (IS) or Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.
“ARSA would like to convey to the Indian Government that our military activities against our legitimate target within Arakan State is far from being a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India in any way whatsoever. ARSA would like to express its heartfelt appreciation to Indian Government for sheltering Rohingya Refugees,” said the group on Sunday in a statement signed by its “commander-in-chief” Al Yaqeen.
The statement was issued following reports in an Indian daily that the group had targeted the Assam Rifles recently near the India-Myanmar border and that it aims to build training camps in the Myanmar territories close to Indian frontiers. ARSA denied the attack and termed the news report as “blatant manipulation”.
The group also claimed that it opposes terrorist attacks and gave assurances of peace to Bangladesh. “ARSA has never carried out and will not carry out any military activity in the territories of any State except in its ancestral home land (Arakan State)...” it said.

Title: Mizoram: Myanmar refugees reluctant to return to their villages
NORTHEAST NOW
NORTHEAST NEWS
Over 300 Myanmar refugees inMizoramwho were evicted from their homes last November are reluctant to return to their villages.
The conflict between the Myanmar Army and a rebel outfit called the Arakan Army resulted in the influx of around 1,600 Myanmar refugees who were rehabilitated in Lawngtlai district, about 280 km south of Mizoram’s capital Aizawl, after they crossed the border to Mizoram on November 25.
Most of the refugees were Buddhist tribals belonging to the Chin community who speak the same language as the Lai in Mizoram who are mainly Christians.
The 30 odd families who are reluctant to go back to Myanmar are apprehensive of violence which according to them could escalate anytime.
“About 300 of them are still languishing in thatched houses at Hmawngbuchhuah village, they have been lamenting tales of violence and discrimination by the Burmese Army,” Central Young Lai Association (YLA) leaders said.
Their tales of sufferings seem to have won the sympathy of the locals at Hmawngbuchhuah; the refugees said that all their houses were burnt down by the Burmese Army and they pleaded the local NGOs to accommodate them.
“We have nothing there anymore, here (in Mizoram) at least we have shelter and above all peace and tranquility,” the refugees told the leaders of the Central YLA.
The crisis erupted at Paletwa after 11 soldiers of the Myanmar Army were reportedly killed on the Kaladan river after being ambushed by the Arakan Army on the border of Myanmar’s Chin and Rakhine State, the Burmese Army retaliated by thrashing anything that came in their way and many civilians became victims of the retaliation and were forced to flee their villages.

Title: Rakhine violence probe panel could be named soon
The Myanmar government could announce as early as next week the members of an independent commission who would investigate alleged human rights abuses in northern Rakhine state, the Myanmar Times newspaper reported.
Executive committee member of the opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), U Maung Myint said the government may make an announcement about the commission in a few days.
“This is a good time. I think they might release a statement, but I have no details,” he said.
U Phay Than, a member of parliament from the Arakan National Party, on Wednesday said the three-member body, which would include a foreign expert, would likely be announced next week.
“I think it may come out in the next 10 days or a bit more,” he said.
On May 31, the government announced plans to establish an independent commission to investigate alleged human rights violations by the Myanmar military and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army in northern Rakhine last year.
It said the commission would consist of three members and be assisted by local and international legal experts. The President’s Office envisioned a panel of two local and one foreign member.
The establishment of the commission was strongly opposed by the military and military-backed lawmakers, who argued that including a foreigner on the commission would be deemed as interference in the country’s domestic affairs.
A source close to the selection process, the government is having difficulty setting up the commission because some of those who were asked to join the commission declined.
The international community, including the UN accused the Myanmar military of large-scale human rights violations against the Muslim minority in northern Rakhine, forcing them to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
The UN estimates that over 700,000 refugees from northern Rakhine are living in cramped camps in Bangladesh.

Myanmar has set up a commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the Rakhine state,Reutersreported on Monday. Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo will head the four-member panel.
“The independent commission will investigate the allegations of human rights  violations and related issues, following the terrorist attacks by ARSA [Arakan  Rohingya Salvation Army],”  the office of President Win Myint said on Monday.
The Arakan  Rohingya Salvation Army is an armed Rohingya group, whose alleged attacks led to a military crackdown in Rakhine state in August 2017. Lakhs of Rohingya Muslim residents fled the country to neighbouring Bangladesh amid the crackdown. The United Nations and the United States have called it “ethnic cleansing”, and de factor leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism for not doing enough to stop the persecution.
The panel will have two local members – lawyer Mya Thein and economist Aung Tun Thet. Aung Tun Thet is a former United Nations official, and was last year appointed by Suu Kyi to a key role in Myanmar’s response to the  Rakhine crisis. The commission also has Japan’s former ambassador to the United Nations, Kenzo Oshima.
The panel is “part of [Myanmar’s] national  initiative to address reconciliation, peace, stability and development  in Rakhine”, the government said.

Kutupalong (Bangladesh):Hundreds of Rohingyas on Monday called for support from the international community during a visit of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to refugee camps in Bangladesh, which host more than 915,000 members of the Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar.
Mud and heavy monsoon rains did not prevent hundreds of Rohingyas from leaving their huts with banners and chanting slogans as Guterres, who is on a two-day official visit to Bangladesh, visited the camps, Efe news reported.
"We want to return to Myanmar as dignified citizens, with security and our all rights," Amir Ahmed, one of the demonstrators in the massive Kutupalong camp, told the news agency.
The camps in Bangladesh host some 915,000 Rohingyas, including around 700,000 who have sought refuge in the country since August 25, 2017 when the Myanmar military launched an offensive in retaliation to an attack on multiple government outposts by Rohingya rebels in the western state of Rakhine.
A Rohingya representative in Kutupalong, Mohammad Mohibulla, said they had 13 demands to deliver to Guterres, who was accompanied by World Bank president Jim Yong Kim.
Mohibulla, who is chairman of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, said their requests included the need for those who committed "genocide" against members of their community in Myanmar to be tried and for compensation for human and material losses.
"We want the UN to deploy troops in an uninterrupted manner in Arakan (Rakhine), we want full citizenship under the name of ethnic Rohingya," instead of identity cards announced by Myanmar in which they would be recognized only as "Bengali", he said.
Myanmar authorities do not recognize the Rohingyas as a distinct ethnic group and instead consider them illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and deny them citizenship and other basic rights.
International pressure led Myanmar and Bangladesh to ink a deal on November 23 to repatriate the Rohingya refugees starting from January 23. However, seven months later, the formal repatriation process is yet to begin.

Title: Families Displaced by Latest Fighting in Shan Start Heading Home - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By NYEIN NYEIN
YANGON — Nearly half of the roughly 1,500 people displaced by inter-ethnic fighting in Shan State’s Namtu Township on Monday have returned to their villages as of this morning or were on their way back, according to local lawmakers.
The villagers fled their homes for other villages in Namtu or neighboring Hsipaw Township whenfightingbroke out between the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army South (RCSS/SSAS) and a combined force from the Shan State Progressive Party/Stan State Army North (SSPP/SSAN) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
About 670 people who took shelters at the Bodaw and Moetay monasteries in Hsipaw have returned as of Friday or would be returning soon now that the fighting around their villages was over, said Nang San San Aye, a state lawmaker representing Hsipaw.
However, nearly 800 people who took shelter at monasteries in the villages of Panlon and Manlay in Namtu were still afraid to head back because fighters continued to patrol near their homes, according to Nang Sam Hom, a state lawmaker representing Namtu.
Nang Sam Hom told The Irrawaddy that the displaced families from five villages — Pan Hat, Manhsar, Man Khe, Man Pan and Nam Si Lin — were staying put for now.
She said 139 people were taking shelters in Panlon and 653 in Manlay and that they were all either ethnic Shan or Ta’ang.
“There is no safety for the local residents; our people have adapted to this,” Nang Sam Hom said.
“Many tend not to leave their homes unless there is heavy fighting,” either between the ethnic armed groups or between the groups and the Myanmar military, she added.
Some people displaced by earlier bouts of fighting in the region have been taking shelter in downtown Namtu for more than seven years and surviving mostly on the charity or local residents and aid groups, Nang Sam Hom said.
Shan State is home to a number of ethnic armed groups formed by ethnic Shan, Ta’ang, Kachin, Wa, Mongla or Kokang as well as various militias.
Most of the fighting has been between the SSAS and either the Myanmar military, TNLA or combined forces of the TNLA and SSAN.
RCSS spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Sai Oo blamed the latest fighting on the TNLA and SSAN for moving into areas long claimed and controlled by his group.
“They [the TNLA and SSAN] don’t want the RCSS to be there,” he told The Irrawaddy.
The TNLA and SSAS have fought many times over the past few years amid on-and-off negotiations.
Over the past two weeks, the SSAS has also had clashes with the Myanmar military in southern Shan State’s Mong Kung Township that have displaced hundreds more.

Title: 3 Civilians Reportedly Killed by Landmines in Shan State in June - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG 4 July 2018
Mon State — At least three people were killed by landmines in northern Shan State last month, according to a local resident and an aid group, amid ongoing fighting in the area between the Myanmar Army and ethnic armed groups.
A man and woman from Kyaukme Township were killed on June 20 when their motorbike hit a mine in a conflict area, according to a resident.
Some locals in Kyaukme believe the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) planted the mine after it heard that the Myanmar Army was heading that way, but the pair ran over the mine before any soldiers arrived.
“The TNLA already warned locals not to travel in the area. But those two were not from the area, so they did not know about it,” said Mai Yan Naing, a township resident.
In another incident, Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid group, reported that a 65-year-old man in Kutkai Township was killed when he stepped on a mine while foraging for mushrooms on June 17.
The Myanmar Red Cross reported that 95 people were killed and 106 were wounded by landmines between 2014 and 2018.
The Myanmar Army usually blames ethnic armed groups for laying the mines, mainly the TNLA and Kachin Independence Army (KIA), while the armed groups tend to blame the army or each other. The KIA has accused the army of planting many mines in Kachin State’s Tanai and Injangyang townships recently while withdrawing their troops.
“They withdrew from some amber and gold mining areas, but they did not withdraw from all of their bases. They continue to be based in some important areas,” Colonel Naw Bu, a spokesman for the KIA, told The Irrawaddy.
The KIA says its fighters recently defused about 80 landmines in Injangyang, in northern Kachin.
“The Tatmadaw [Myanmar Army] planted those landmines,” Col. Naw Bu said.
The colonel said the army had also planted many mines in areas the KIA claims in Tanai, but he did not know how many of those the KIA had defused to date.
Col Naw Bu said KIA and army mines were easy to distinguish because the KIA’s mines were improvised and the army’s were factory-made.
Free Burma Ranger also reported that four civilians were killed and four were wounded by mines in Kachin since April. It accused the army of laying the mines.

Title: Six Medics Found Dead After Clashes in Myanmar’s Volatile Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
An ethnic armed group engaged in hostilities in Myanmar’s Shan state said Tuesday that government troops killed six female medics held in captivity, amid ongoing fighting in one of the most volatile regions of the country.
The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said government forces took the women as prisoners of war after ambushing them on the afternoon of July 11 in northern Shan’s Namkham township as they were traveling to a village in the northern part of the state, killing a TNLA soldier trying to protect them.
Major Mai Aik Kyaw, a TNLA spokesman, said the abductions took place during hostilities between TNLA troops and the government army’s Infantry Battalion 301.
“The government army attacked us on July 11 at Arlaw village of Mangton township,” he told RFA's Myanmar Service. “One [soldier] was killed during the fighting, and six female medics were arrested and taken.”
“The bodies of the six female medics and one soldier were found together in a grave on July 14,” he said.
When the women’s bodies were found on July 14, two had gunshot wounds and the other four had stab wounds and bruises from beatings, said a statement issued by the TNLA on Tuesday.
Other soldiers were injured during fighting on July 11 when the medics were taken away, but they managed to escape and reported the abductions, it said.
Government soldiers took three guns from the women who were traveling in the area to provide medical treatment to villagers, the statement said.
After local residents discovered the bodies of the women in a forested area outside a village, they buried them the same day, it said.
So far, Myanmar’s Commander-in-Chief’s Office has not issued news of the killings.
RFA’s Myanmar Service was unable to reach spokesmen from the Ministry of Defense for confirmation and additional information.
The killings have sparked outrage among ethnic Ta’ang residents, who accuse government forces of violating the rights of prisoners of war, the online journal The Irrawaddy said.
Ethnic rivals clash
Meanwhile, a clash between rival ethnic armies on Monday forced nearly 1,000 local residents of Mingmu village in Shan state’s Namtu township to flee their homes and seek safety in Buddhist monasteries in the nearby townships of Namtu and Thibaw, also known as Hsipaw.
“About 500 people fled to Hsipaw township, and the rest went to Mangsan village in Namtu township,” Nang Kham Aye, a lawmaker from the Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD) who represents Namtu Township in the lower house of parliament, told RFA on Tuesday.
Local residents, civil society organizations, and local government departments are providing food and medicine to the displaced persons, some of whom are in need of clothing after fleeing their farms, sources said.
Fighting broke out on Monday between the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S), and a joint force of the TNLA and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) near Mingmu village.
The RCSS blamed the hostilities on an offensive launched by the TNLA and SSPP against the ethnic militia’s positions, The Irrawaddy reported.
The militia said it had withdrawn its troops on four different occasions to avoid clashes with Northern Alliance armies, but that TNLA-SSPP joint forces attacked its units, the report said.
The Northern Alliance is a military coalition of four ethnic armies — the Arakan Army (AA), Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) — that have been engaged in fighting with government troops in Shan and neighboring Kachin state.
The TNLA has been fighting the Myanmar army and the RCSS in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and some of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The RCSS is one of 10 signatories of the NCA, while the TNLA has been excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar’s armed forces.
In March, the TNLA engaged in hostilities against the Myanmar military along the border between Kyaukme and Namhsan townships and in Namtu township, but began to fight the RCSS when its troops entered TNLA-controlled territory and harassed local villagers, took some farm animals, and laid mines in the area’s outskirts, Mai Aik Kyaw told RFA at the time.
Four days of fighting between Myanmar forces and the RCSS that began on July 9 in two villages in Shan state's Mong Kung township forced about 500 residents to flee to safety in monasteries.
Hostilities between the two sides flared when Myanmar forces entered areas controlled by the RCSS and warned the ethnic army to leave new areas that its soldiers had moved into in the southern part of the state, which the government army said were not included in the NCA.
The fresh clashes began two days before the Myanmar government opened the third session of its 21st-Century Panglong Conference to bring ethnic armies, the military, and other stakeholders to the negotiating table in a bid to end decades of armed conflict and strained relations with ethnic minority groups.
The session ended on Monday after the 700 delegates in attendance agreed to 14 basic principles covering social issues, the political sector, the economy, and land issues, though no agreement was reached in the security sector, where the powerful national military and the ethnic militias remain at loggerheads.

Shan-ni tongue and culture revive after years of suppression and conflict
LONE TON, Myanmar -- A punchy cadence echoes from a one-story school building toward verdant mountains -- the familiar sound of children reciting lines to learn a language. But in this part of northern Myanmar, speaking Shan-ni, the local dialect, only a decade ago was seen as taboo, and treated as a crime.
Soldiers on both sides of a long-running conflict would punish those who spoke it, according to locals, and for decades the government banned the language in schools. Yet on the shores of Indawgyi Lake, Myanmar's biggest lake, determination to restore the tongue is strong.

Title: Hundreds of Shan Villagers Flee Mong Kung as Tatmadaw Assaults RCSS Positions - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG
MON STATE — More than 450 ethnic Shan have been displaced from five villages in Mong Kung Township, Shan State, by three days of fighting between the Myanmar Army and RCSS/SSA-South troops, according to local sources.
Sai Sam Mong, a lawmaker from Shan’s Kyethi Township, told The Irrawaddy that the villagers fled Tuesday and Wednesday amid near constant fighting near their villages.
“They fled early in the morning. In total there were 451 villagers. They fled from five villages today [Wednesday] and yesterday,” Sai Sam Mong said.
All of the displaced people were sheltering at a Shan Buddhist monastery, where monks had offered them food. The IDPs will need more supplies, as they do not know when they will be able to return to their villages.
Authorities from Mong Kung planned to visit the IDPs today and will distribute some food, according to Sai Sam Mong.
The IDPs were able to hear artillery fire on Wednesday morning, according to Sai Sam Mong, who visited to IDPs at the monastery on the same day.
The fighting took place in forested areas not far from the IDPs’ villages, and some shells had landed in their rice fields, forcing them to flee.
On Tuesday, the fighting lasted almost the whole day, according to local IDPs. They said the latest round of fighting erupted the previous day when the Myanmar Army attacked an RCSS base in the area.
“We heard the fighting from 7 a.m. until nightfall [on Tuesday]. Some IDPs fled without any belongings because they were so afraid of the artillery,” Sai Sam Mong said.
According to local IDPs, prior to the latest attack, the Myanmar Army had not been active in the area since the RCSS signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) in October 2015.
The Myanmar Army’s attack followed a warning to RCSS troops to return to their old bases from new areas in southern Shan that the Tatmadaw claims are off limits to the ethnic armed organization under the terms of the NCA.
More Myanmar Army troops have been deployed in RCSS areas recently, and the Tatmadaw has engaged in large troop movements, according to the RCSS.
Lieutenant-Colonel Sai Oo, an RCSS spokesperson, said the current attacks by the Myanmar Army were related to their warning last week.

Title: Six Medics Found Dead After Clashes in Myanmar’s Volatile Shan State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
An ethnic armed group engaged in hostilities in Myanmar’s Shan state said Tuesday that government troops killed six female medics held in captivity, amid ongoing fighting in one of the most volatile regions of the country.
The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said government forces took the women as prisoners of war after ambushing them on the afternoon of July 11 in northern Shan’s Namkham township as they were traveling to a village in the northern part of the state, killing a TNLA soldier trying to protect them.
Major Mai Aik Kyaw, a TNLA spokesman, said the abductions took place during hostilities between TNLA troops and the government army’s Infantry Battalion 301.
“The government army attacked us on July 11 at Arlaw village of Mangton township,” he told RFA's Myanmar Service. “One [soldier] was killed during the fighting, and six female medics were arrested and taken.”
“The bodies of the six female medics and one soldier were found together in a grave on July 14,” he said.
When the women’s bodies were found on July 14, two had gunshot wounds and the other four had stab wounds and bruises from beatings, said a statement issued by the TNLA on Tuesday.
Other soldiers were injured during fighting on July 11 when the medics were taken away, but they managed to escape and reported the abductions, it said.
Government soldiers took three guns from the women who were traveling in the area to provide medical treatment to villagers, the statement said.
After local residents discovered the bodies of the women in a forested area outside a village, they buried them the same day, it said.
So far, Myanmar’s Commander-in-Chief’s Office has not issued news of the killings.
RFA’s Myanmar Service was unable to reach spokesmen from the Ministry of Defense for confirmation and additional information.
The killings have sparked outrage among ethnic Ta’ang residents, who accuse government forces of violating the rights of prisoners of war, the online journal The Irrawaddy said.
Ethnic rivals clash
Meanwhile, a clash between rival ethnic armies on Monday forced nearly 1,000 local residents of Mingmu village in Shan state’s Namtu township to flee their homes and seek safety in Buddhist monasteries in the nearby townships of Namtu and Thibaw, also known as Hsipaw.
“About 500 people fled to Hsipaw township, and the rest went to Mangsan village in Namtu township,” Nang Kham Aye, a lawmaker from the Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD) who represents Namtu Township in the lower house of parliament, told RFA on Tuesday.
Local residents, civil society organizations, and local government departments are providing food and medicine to the displaced persons, some of whom are in need of clothing after fleeing their farms, sources said.
Fighting broke out on Monday between the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S), and a joint force of the TNLA and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) near Mingmu village.
The RCSS blamed the hostilities on an offensive launched by the TNLA and SSPP against the ethnic militia’s positions, The Irrawaddy reported.
The militia said it had withdrawn its troops on four different occasions to avoid clashes with Northern Alliance armies, but that TNLA-SSPP joint forces attacked its units, the report said.
The Northern Alliance is a military coalition of four ethnic armies — the Arakan Army (AA), Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) — that have been engaged in fighting with government troops in Shan and neighboring Kachin state.
The TNLA has been fighting the Myanmar army and the RCSS in Shan state since late November 2015, about six weeks after the signing of a nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA) between the government and some of the country’s more than 20 ethnic armed groups.
The RCSS is one of 10 signatories of the NCA, while the TNLA has been excluded from signing the accord because of its ongoing hostilities with Myanmar’s armed forces.
In March, the TNLA engaged in hostilities against the Myanmar military along the border between Kyaukme and Namhsan townships and in Namtu township, but began to fight the RCSS when its troops entered TNLA-controlled territory and harassed local villagers, took some farm animals, and laid mines in the area’s outskirts, Mai Aik Kyaw told RFA at the time.
Four days of fighting between Myanmar forces and the RCSS that began on July 9 in two villages in Shan state's Mong Kung township forced about 500 residents to flee to safety in monasteries.
Hostilities between the two sides flared when Myanmar forces entered areas controlled by the RCSS and warned the ethnic army to leave new areas that its soldiers had moved into in the southern part of the state, which the government army said were not included in the NCA.
The fresh clashes began two days before the Myanmar government opened the third session of its 21st-Century Panglong Conference to bring ethnic armies, the military, and other stakeholders to the negotiating table in a bid to end decades of armed conflict and strained relations with ethnic minority groups.
The session ended on Monday after the 700 delegates in attendance agreed to 14 basic principles covering social issues, the political sector, the economy, and land issues, though no agreement was reached in the security sector, where the powerful national military and the ethnic militias remain at loggerheads.

Title: 3 Civilians Reportedly Killed by Landmines in Shan State in June - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By LAWI WENG 4 July 2018
Mon State — At least three people were killed by landmines in northern Shan State last month, according to a local resident and an aid group, amid ongoing fighting in the area between the Myanmar Army and ethnic armed groups.
A man and woman from Kyaukme Township were killed on June 20 when their motorbike hit a mine in a conflict area, according to a resident.
Some locals in Kyaukme believe the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) planted the mine after it heard that the Myanmar Army was heading that way, but the pair ran over the mine before any soldiers arrived.
“The TNLA already warned locals not to travel in the area. But those two were not from the area, so they did not know about it,” said Mai Yan Naing, a township resident.
In another incident, Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid group, reported that a 65-year-old man in Kutkai Township was killed when he stepped on a mine while foraging for mushrooms on June 17.
The Myanmar Red Cross reported that 95 people were killed and 106 were wounded by landmines between 2014 and 2018.
The Myanmar Army usually blames ethnic armed groups for laying the mines, mainly the TNLA and Kachin Independence Army (KIA), while the armed groups tend to blame the army or each other. The KIA has accused the army of planting many mines in Kachin State’s Tanai and Injangyang townships recently while withdrawing their troops.
“They withdrew from some amber and gold mining areas, but they did not withdraw from all of their bases. They continue to be based in some important areas,” Colonel Naw Bu, a spokesman for the KIA, told The Irrawaddy.
The KIA says its fighters recently defused about 80 landmines in Injangyang, in northern Kachin.
“The Tatmadaw [Myanmar Army] planted those landmines,” Col. Naw Bu said.
The colonel said the army had also planted many mines in areas the KIA claims in Tanai, but he did not know how many of those the KIA had defused to date.
Col Naw Bu said KIA and army mines were easy to distinguish because the KIA’s mines were improvised and the army’s were factory-made.
Free Burma Ranger also reported that four civilians were killed and four were wounded by mines in Kachin since April. It accused the army of laying the mines.

Title: Analysis of the FPNCC/Northern Alliance and Myanmar conflict dynamics - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
With the Myanmar military pressuring all ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) to sign the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), non-signatory EAOs have responded by forming a loose military alliance, called the Northern Alliance, to strengthen their position against the military. As with many alliances in Myanmar’s history, the cohesiveness and long-term viability of the alliance is uncertain. Increased military operations by the Myanmar military against the groups in this alliance, particularly the increased use of remote violence, has resulted in the alliance groups shifting their tactics both politically and militarily.
In 2016, four EAOs formed the Northern Alliance. The driver behind the formation of the Northern Alliance was the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) which has been in conflict with the Myanmar military for several decades. From 1994-2011, the KIA had a bilateral ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar military which held. The conflict reignited in 2011 after the KIA rejected the military’s Border Guard Force (BGF) scheme which would have placed the KIA under the control of the military. At the time, the Myanmar military also had increased its presence in the Kachin region to guard the Chinese construction of the Myitsone Hydropower Dam which exacerbated tensions, leading eventually to the start of the current war.
The KIA has since sought to strengthen its position by providing training and support to the Arakan Army (AA), the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). These four groups have fought alongside one another as allies in many battles, sometimes fighting as the ‘Northern Alliance’ and other times fighting jointly without the moniker.
Since 2016, there has been a significant increase in the use of remote violence between Myanmar state forces and the Northern Alliance groups (see Figure 1). This is primarily due to the Myanmar military’s increased use of air strikes, mortars, and heavy artillery to attack the groups’ positions. When the conflict with the KIA restarted, the KIA was at a slight advantage for a ground war given their familiarity with the mountainous terrain in Kachin and northern Shan state. The Myanmar military’s increased use of remote violence to wage war has put the KIA and allied groups at a disadvantage and has contributed to a shift in the alliance’s tactics. When the Northern Alliance attacked military and police outposts in northern Shan state in November 2016, they attributed their actions to the losses that they were suffering due to the Myanmar military’s aerial offensives and the resulting difficulty of fighting in the jungle, thus leading them to carry out an offensive on state forces based in an urban area.

Title: 400 Returned IDPs Facing Food Shortages in Kachin State - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
By Lawi Weng 9 July 2018
Two local Kachin aid groups have appealed to other aid organizations to help provide food for almost 400 ethnic Kachin IDPs who returned to their three villages in Injangyang Township, northern Kachin State, last month.
The 397 IDPs went back to the villages of Njang Yang, Nlawt Yang and Ngyeng Kawng on June 18 and 19 after the Kachin State government told some religious leaders to send the IDPs home as there had been no fighting in Injangyang Township recently.
“We can say it was okay for them for to return to their villages. Their houses were not destroyed by fighting, so they could go straight back to stay in their homes,” said Seng Nu, program coordinator with the Myitkyina-based Karuna Mission Social Solidarity (KMSS), which is one of two groups providing assistance to the IDPs.
“For food, we only have enough for one month, and we do not have any agreement with other aid groups to provide food for them for other months,” she said. “Therefore, we are still appealing for food from other organizations.”
The IDPs initially stayed at Tanghpre IDP camp in Injangyang Township, where KMSS and the Diocese of Myitkyina-Myanmar provided food for them. They fled from their homes when the Myanmar Army launched a major military offensive against the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in April.
The resettlement plan was set in motion after the Myanmar Army, Kachin State Government, and lawmakers told some senior Kachin Catholic leaders to send the IDPs back to their villages. The authorities firstly told the bishop in Myitkyina, who then passed the order on to the parish priest. But the two religious leaders did not discuss what help the IDPs would need with local aid groups.
“It was a personal decision to send the IDPs back, not an organizational one,” said a statement issued on June 26 from the Diocese of Myitkyina-Myanmar, the second aid group helping the IDPs.
Seng Nu said those who work with the IDPs did not know anything about the resettlement plan. “For the KMSS, as soon as we heard they had gone back to their villages, we went to find them to see what condition they were in.”
The Myanmar Army and KIA have not recently engaged in hostilities in Injangyang Township. But the IDPs will not be safe if they try to find food in the jungle. Therefore, the two local aid groups said that they would need supplies until October.
Groups that work with IDPs normally send them back home when they feel it is safe for them to return. The aid groups provide sufficient food to help the IDPs stay at their village based on the resettlement plan.
“Based on our timeframe, and their demands, they will need food until on October,” Seng Nu said.
There are more than 10,000 IDPs in Kachin State. Some IDP camps are in government-controlled areas, but there are also some in KIA-held areas near the Chinese border.
The government wants to shut down some IDP camps in Kachin, northern Shan, and Karen State, as well as in Rakhine, but it has not revealed details of its plan yet.
