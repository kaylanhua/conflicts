The rebel faction Arakan Army in Myanmar has released 52 villagers from the predominantly Christian Khumi community in the Western Chin state after they were detained for six months in a border camp.
Radio Free Asiareportedthe release last week, citing a local pastor and the Arakan Army. The Khumi villagers were abducted in February from their communities following a battle with Myanmar's military troops.
Although the Khumi Affairs Consultative Council accused the Arakan Army of taking the villagers by force, the rebel group vehemently denied that accusation.
In April, a spokesperson for the rebel faction said the Arakan Army helped the villagers flee to safety after fighting in Chin's Paletwa township. The spokesperson claimed that the Arakan Army did not take the villagers by force.
Fifty-four villagers were initially said to have been detained by the Arakan Army but two villagers were able to escape.
KACC chairman Kyaw Nyeinsaid in Aprilthat the villagers who escaped said the rest of the villagers were being held at an Arakan Army outpost along the border of Myanmar, India, and Bangladesh.
According to Radio Free Asia, the Arakan Army released the Khumi villagers and sent them to community leaders in the Ohnthee Wa village. The released villagers are expected to stay at an internally displaced persons camp in Meezar.
“They said that all have been released," Pastor Moses told Radio Free Asia.The release of the villagers was praised by the U.S.-based persecution watchdog and charity International Christian Concern.
"For the Chin captives who were held against their will for months, this is definitely encouraging news that they could finally return home," ICC Regional Manager Gina Goh said in astatement. "We rejoice with them and their loved ones. However, the AA should not have taken them in the first place. Civilians have the right to live without fear despite ongoing armed conflicts between the AA and Tatmadaw [Myanmar military]."According to theJoshua Project, the Khumi community in Myanmar is about 66,000 in population with 80 percent being Christian.
Myanmar, a Buddhist-majority country, ranks as the 18th-worst persecutor of Christians in the world, according to Open Doors USA's 2019 World Watch List.
Open Doorswarnsthat churches are being attacked even in predominantly Christian states like Kachin, Karen and Shan. With increased fighting in 2018 in places like Kachin state, Open Doors estimates that over 100,000 Christians have been forced out of their homes as internally displaced persons.
"And radical Buddhist monks, generally tolerated by the government, have invaded church properties and built Buddhist shrines on church premises," an Open Doors factsheet reads. "Anyone deviating from the Buddhist heritage is regarded as an outsider and as potentially dangerous."Last year, it wasreportedthat as many as 90 Christian leaders were detained by the United Wa State Army, another rebel faction in Eastern Myanmar. Additionally, over 50 churches were said to have been closed down.
In the Kachin state, it was reported last July that the Myanmar army hadbombed 60 churchesand replaced some of them with Buddhist pagodas.
The U.S. State Department has designated Myanmar as a "country of particular" concern for egregious religious liberty violations.
The predominantly-Muslim Rohingya community in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state has faced what advocates are calling a "genocide"systematically plannedby the Myanmar military.
Because of themilitary onslaughtof their communities in 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas have been forced to flee as refugees into neighboring Bangladesh.
This week, a United Nationsfact-finding reportcalled on the international community to "sever ties with Myanmar’s military and the vast web of companies it controls and relies on."
The U.N. report details how the Myanmar military profits from domestic and foreign business deals to bolster its ability to carry out "gross violations of human rights with impunity. The report called for U.N. member states to impose targeted sanctions against companies run by the Myanmar military.
The U.N. fact-finding mission also called for the imposition of an arms embargo as over 14 firms from seven nations have supplied weaponry to Myanmar since 2016.
"During this period the military carried out extensive and systematic human rights violations against civilians in Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states, including the forced deportation of more than 700,000 ethnic Rohingya to Bangladesh," the report explains.

A Myanmar court yesterday charged eight people with financing terrorism, including six deported from Singapore last month over allegations they had sent money to ethnic rebels in the conflict-torn Rakhine region.
Recently, civilians have been caught up in clashes between the military and the Arakan Army, an insurgent group that recruits from the mainly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine population and is fighting for greater autonomy for the state.
Myanmar has designated the Arakan Army a terrorist organization.
The Myanmar army has battled various autonomy-seeking ethnic minority insurgent groups for decades but several have agreed to make peace in recent years.

Title: Myanmar Army Warns of Full-Blown War in Shan, Deploys Aircraft in Rakhine

2019-08-23 -- The Myanmar military on Friday accused an ethnic armed group operating in Myanmar's northeastern Shan state of terrorism and drug trafficking, and issued a strong warning that it is ready to engage in full-blown armed conflict a week after the rebel force and two other ethnic armies conducted coordinated attacks on roads, bridges, and military and police buildings.
The Aug. 15 attacks by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic Palaung group, and two other ethnic armies – the Arakan Army (AA), and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) – left 15 people dead, including nine soldiers, and more than a dozen other people injured.
In the days following the violence, the alliance of ethnic armies has carried out additional armed assaults and clashes with Myanmar forces, leaving a few more people dead and forcing thousands of residents to temporarily flee their homes.
Late last year, the Myanmar military declared a temporary unilateral cease-fire in five of its regional commands in a bid to boost the prospects of ending hostilities with ethnic armies, though the suspension has not held up in Shan state. The cease-fire expires on Aug. 31.
"Most of the attacks on Aug. 15 were not in military-related places," said Myanmar military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi at a press conference in Naypyidaw.
"These are not only terrorism acts, but also [acts] that tarnish the country's and government's images," he said. "They were more than terrorist attacks. They were an act of brutality and could be described as a war crime."
He admonished the TNLA for allegedly setting fire to a soldier and a civilian who were on duty at a police checkpoint for illegal drugs in Shan's Nawngkhio township, calling it a brutal and inhumane act.
His comments prompted a swift denial by TNLA spokesman Major Mai Aik Kyaw, who said the attacks were in response to Myanmar Army offensives.
"We attacked on Aug. 15 because of the army's offensives on us," he told RFA's Myanmar Service. "If they hadn't carried out these attacks, we'd have no reason to attack them back."
"We didn't set fire to anybody," he added. "Yes, we had a brief fight at the drugs checkpoint, and a car caught on fire during the fighting. Some people who already had been shot were in the car and caught on fire from the flames. We didn't deliberately set them on fire."
'We are ready'
The three armed groups that staged the Aug. 15 attacks are fighting for greater autonomy, territory, and access to resources in their respective areas.
At times, they also have been involved in illegal drug trafficking in northern Shan state, though the TNLA has an avowedly anti-drug policy.
Nevertheless, another Myanmar military spokesman accused the Ta'ang force of drug trafficking on a mass scale.
"We have seized more than a billion kyats [U.S. $629,000] worth of drugs in the ethnic armed groups' control areas," said Major General Soe Naing Oo, chairman of the military's True News Information Team.
"Working on anti-drug operations is our duty, and we will keep working on it," he said.
But Mai Aik Kyaw denied this accusation as well.
"No, the TNLA doesn't do any drug business," he said. "Drug dealers sometimes pass through our controlled area though, but it is not related to us."
The Myanmar military, meanwhile, said it still wants to hold peace talks with Myanmar's ethnic armed organizations at a location in Shan state, though it was not immediately clear whether the TNLA, AA, and MNDAA would participate.
"If the TNLA comes to the peace talks, then the military welcomes it," Soe Naing Oo said. "If the TNLA wants to continue fighting against us, we are ready."
In response, Mai Aik Kyaw signaled the TNLA's equal readiness to begin full combat against Myanmar troops.
"If the military launches its offensive, we are ready to fight them back," he said.
Mai Ohn Kyaw, a lawmaker from the Ta'ang National Party, warned that both sides must come to the negotiating table to discuss ending one of Myanmar's long-standing civil wars.
"If both sides keep on accusing one another, the war will never end," he told RFA. "The best way is to talk. If we want peace, we have to talk. We will never have peace if we keep fighting each other like this."
Civilian shot in the back
Also on Friday, Myanmar forces deployed aircraft during intense fighting with the AA in a village in war-torn Rakhine state's Minbya township amid ongoing armed conflict in the western region that has left more than 100 civilians dead and more than 80 wounded, and displaced tens of thousands of others during the last eight months.
Local witnesses said hostilities in Panmyaung village began on Thursday morning and that two Myanmar fighter jets launched air attacks after the battle intensified near Shwekyin, an area downstream along the Laymyo River.
Two helicopters also attacked targets near Kyaung Taung village along the river's upper reaches, they said.
"Around 11:55 a.m., two helicopters flew over the village and fired their guns toward the mountain," said a Kyaung Taung resident who declined to be named out of fear for his safety.
"The shells from their guns fell onto houses in the village," he said. "They also fell onto the monastery. All the people who were in the monastery for a religious observance ran into the village, and the villagers witnessed the attacks as the [helicopters] flew overhead."
AA spokesman Khine Thukha said three AA soldiers were killed and others were injured during fighting on Thursday, and that more than 40 Myanmar soldiers died.
He said he did not have information about Friday's battle.
Commenting on the airstrikes by Myanmar forces, he said: "I think they must have lost many soldiers yesterday, and that's why they were using helicopters to bomb us. It is the same with the fighting today. Some of their soldiers were trapped. That's why they were attacking with helicopters as a last resort."
But Win Zaw Oo, spokesman for the Myanmar military's Western Regional Command responsible for Rakhine state, said few soldiers were injured.
"There were a few injuries on our side," he said. "I don't know the exact numbers."
"The AA must have suffered casualties too because the clashes were not minor," he added. "I don't know the details of their causalities."
RFA could not independently confirm information about the battles in Minbya township.
Shots fired into village
Also on Friday, Myanmar soldiers fired shots into a village after a military column was hit by a mine blast near Tun Rawae Bridge in Rathedaung township, hitting a 20-year-old woman in the back as she ran away with other villagers, a local monk said.
Khin Win Shwe from Tun Rawae village was taken to Sittwe General Hospital for urgent treatment, said Taza Bala, abbot of a Buddhist monastery.
Volunteers helping Khin Win Shwe said they were preparing to take her to Yangon for medical care because she was in critical condition, he said.
"I heard a blast like a bomb explosion around 7 a.m.," he said. "Afterwards, the military column fired with small weapons into the village. People ran in a panic, and a woman was hit. All the people from the village saw them shooting into the village."
Taza Bala said the shots were fired by as soldiers as they conducted clearance operations following a mine explosion.
Win Zaw Oo told RFA he had no information about the shooting or the mine attack.
The AA claimed responsibility for the blast, though it said it did not know the number of dead and wounded from the Myanmar Army column.

Title: Villagers Killed By Artillery In Northern Myanmar
31.08.2019 15:05
Five civilians, including two children, were killed in northeastern Myanmar Saturday when artillery hit a village amid talks between rebel groups and the government to end the conflict.Heavy fighting broke out for more than six hours between Myanmar's military and the Northern Alliance rebel coalition near the town of Kutkai in the northern Shan state early on Saturday, according to local media reports and activists.The Radio Free Asia Burmese service reported artillery shells landed in the village of Mawhit, killing three women and two children.It added that three others were injured and taken to hospital in Lashio, the capital of northern Shan.Lwan Nyel, vice-chair of the Kachin Literature and Culture Association in Shan state, told Anadolu Agency that three shells hit Mawhit."A shell hit a house directly, and killed a mother and her 5-month old daughter in the house," she said by phone from the village.She added that a nine-year-old boy was also among the five casualties.It is unclear which groups â€“ military or rebel groups â€“ fired the shell."We don't know, and don't want to know who is responsible for this incident," said Lwan Nyel. "We just want this kind of incident to never happen again."There has been fighting on a daily basis since the Northern Alliance -- a rebel collation of the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Arakan Army, and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army -- last month launched synchronized attacks on a major military training academy and several positions in Shan state, halting Myanmar-China cross-border trade.The Myanmar government's Union Peace Commission and rebel representatives on Saturday held a meeting in Kengtung, a town near Myanmar's northeastern border with China.It brought no breakthrough, but parties said that they agreed to meet again on Sept. 16-17 to end fighting and reach a deal for a bilateral cease-fire. -


Title: Fresh Clash in Myanmar's Northern Shan State Drives Ethnic Villagers From Homes

2019-08-07
More than 200 villagers fled their homes in Tangyan township on Tuesday to escape nearby fighting between the Myanmar military and Shan State Army-North troops in northeastern Shan state, local residents said.
The clash between the two warring sides near Narpain village in Tangyan township forced the villagers to take shelter in Buddhist monasteries, about seven miles from Tangyan town, they said.
"More than 70 are in Lonehomone monastery, over 80 are in Homen monastery, and over 70 are in Tautlot monastery," one resident who declined to be named out of fear of retribution told RFA.
Most of the villagers who fled their homes amid the skirmish were children and the elderly who are Shan and Palaung (Ta'ang) ethnics, residents said.
Shan ethnics have taken shelter in Tautlot monastery, while the Palaung people went to Homen monastery after SSA-N troops asked them to leave the area before the battle began, the first resident said.
"We are now trying to find food supplies for them in the monastery compound," he added.
"Nearly 90 people arrived yesterday from villages close to the battle," said Abbot Umeintika of Lonehmone monastery.
"Some have now returned home, and only 70-some people are left," he said. "Some went to stay with their relatives in town."
Lieutenant Colonel Sai Hsu from the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP), the political wing of the SSA-N, said the fighting was sparked by measures it is taking under its drug eradication campaign in the state, as announced at an Aug. 2 meeting.
"In areas where our members are active, we are taking urine samples from travelers to see if they are using illegal drugs," he told RFA's Myanmar Service. "It led to the armed confrontation with the military."
So far, the SSPP has arrested more than 100 people on drug-related crimes since it began its latest campaign, Sai Hsu said.
Those whose urine tests confirm the presence of an illegal substance face two to six months of detention in rehabilitation centers, while drug dealers will face three to five years in prison, he said.
Though the SSPP had been accused of recruiting new members under the guise of arrests made under its drug eradication program and of demanding money from the family members of those arrested to secure their release, the ethnic armed group denies the accusation, he said.
Military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said there were no casualties from the fighting that occurred about six miles southeast of Tangyan town.
The hostilities took place despite state and national level cease-fire agreements that the SSPP has signed with the government military.
The SSPP said it will not curtail its drug eradication measures because of clashes with the Myanmar Army, which engaged in fighting with the group in spite of a temporary unilateral cease-fire that the government military declared in its regional command zones in Shan state.
Shan state and neighboring Kachin state are hotbeds of illegal drug and smuggling activities where ethnic rebel groups – some of which take part in the illegal activities – have engaged in periodic hostilities with Myanmar's armed forces during the last few years.

Title: Myanmar ethnic rebel alliance makes coordinated attacks
MANDALAY, Myanmar (AP) — Ethnic rebels in Myanmar staged coordinated attacks Thursday in five locations, including at a military academy outside normal combat areas, where a civilian was killed and a soldier wounded.
The Northern Alliance, a coalition of armed groups from the Kokang, Rakhine and Ta-ang, or Palaung, minorities, claimed responsibility for the attacks in Mandalay Region, where the Defense Services Technology Academy is located, and in Northern Shan state, where 14 people were reported killed.
The rebel alliance said they launched the attacks in self-defense because the Myanmar military didn't stop offensive operations in areas where the minorities live.
The rebels are active in northern Myanmar, including Northern Shan State's Naung Cho township, where they damaged a bridge and attacked a police outpost.
A volunteer from the Saydanarmon Civil Society group in Naung Cho said they had recovered 14 bodies from Thursday's fighting, including two civilians and members of the security forces.
A Defense Ministry statement acknowledged attacks in five places, and charged that they were carried out in retaliation for government raids on illicit drug operations. It noted the death of a civilian staff member of the military academy and the wounding of a soldier. Combat in Northern Shan State is not unusual, but attacks in Mandalay region, the country's heartland, are virtually unprecedented.
The military's statement also said the rebels in a separate attack seized six 107-mm rockets.
Since getting independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has been wracked by fighting with minority groups in border areas seeking greater autonomy from the central government. In the past three decades, the government has reached various cease-fire arrangements with many groups, but it is striving for a comprehensive, more permanent political situation. Most of the groups have so far rejected the government's attempts at a settlement, and combat is ongoing in northern and western areas of the country.
The rebel alliance comprises the Kokang minority's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army), and the Arakan Army. It posted its statement on the attacks on the Russian social media site VK, where it established an account just days ago under the name "Three Brother Alliance Group."
The Kokang minority was long associated with the production of illicit drugs, such as opium and its derivative, heroin, but claims to have left the trade. The Ta'ang group in recent years has staged a number of deadly hit-and-run raids in northern cities. The Arakan Army, which claims to act on behalf of the Buddhist Rakhine minority in the western state of Rakhine, has been carrying out large-scale stacks on government forces on its home ground since late last year.
Myanmar's military warned in a statement Wednesday that a general cease-fire it declared last year "paving the way for the ethnic armed organizations to engage in peace talks without being forced or pressured" will expire at the end of this month. Reports from both the government and rebels suggest that the cease-fire was rarely observed.

Title: Northern Alliance Agrees to Meeting With Myanmar Government Negotiators - Myanmar | ReliefWeb
Myanmar
An alliance of ethnic armed organizations agreed on Thursday to meet with Myanmar government peace negotiators in war-torn Shan state on Saturday to discuss a possible end to recent clashes with national troops, following an assurance from neighboring China that the rebels will be safe during the talks, those with knowledge of the matter said.
The four groups that comprise the Northern Alliance — the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Arakan Army (AA), will hold discussions with members of the Myanmar Peace Commission (MPC) in the eastern Shan town of Kengtung, sources said.
The TNLA, MNDAA, and AA have been engaged in fierce clashes with Myanmar forces since Aug. 15 when they launched coordinated attacks on five locations in northern Shan state and Mandalay region, killing 15 Myanmar soldiers, policemen, and civilians. The KIA was not involved in the attacks.
The three ethnic armies said they conducted the armed assaults in retaliation for offensives by Myanmar soldiers against them in areas under their control.
The attacks sparked fresh fighting in Shan’s Kutkai, Muse, Lashio, and Kyaukme townships, forcing thousands of villagers to flee their homes and breaching a temporary cease-fire that the Myanmar military declared in five of its military command regions, including Shan state.
The cease-fire expires on Aug. 31, the day of the meeting.
The groups decided to participate in the meeting after China said it would guarantee them safety during the talks amid heightened mutual distrust on both sides because of the hostilities.
Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs from China’s foreign ministry, met last week with the ethnic armies to tell them that Beijing did not accept the armed conflict, which has increased instability in the border region, and pressured them to stop fighting ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1.
“We agreed to meet because the Chinese government said it would be responsible for safety during the Kengtung talks,” said AA spokesman Khine Thukha, adding that the Arakan force would be represented by AA deputy chief Major General Nyo Tun Aung at the meeting.
“The talks will focus on a bilateral [cease-fire] agreement,” he said. “We believe the talks will be constructive if there is a sincere will for having peace in the nation. But they [government negotiators] will be the ones who destroy the peace process should they force what they want.”
The ruling civilian-led National League for Democracy (NLD) government under leader Aung San Suu Kyi wants to end decades of civil war in the county to move ahead with the creation of a federal democratic union.
But the process has stalled, and only 10 of Myanmar’s more than 20 ethnic armies have signed the government’s nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA).
‘Fighting will continue’
The members of the Northern Alliance have not signed truces with the government and continue to engage in sporadic fighting with Myanmar forces in their quest for greater autonomy and ethnic minority rights within a federal system.
When the Northern Alliance met informally with the MPC earlier this year, however, the ethnic armies expressed a willingness to sign bilateral peace pacts with the Myanmar military before holding discussions on whether to join the NCA. They exchanged further proposals in subsequent meetings in two different towns in Shan state in April and June.
One of the sticking points in the discussions has been the government’s insistence that the AA stop its military operations in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, and limit its activities to Laiza, headquarters of its Northern Alliance partner, the KIA, since the AA was formed a decade ago to wage war against the national military.
Hostilities between the AA and Myanmar forces intensified in northern Rakhine state in late 2018 and again in January, when Arakan fighters attacked police outposts. Ongoing clashes have driven tens of thousands of civilians from their homes, and left dozens of others dead and injured.
San Aung from the Peace-Talk Creation Group said another bone of contention has been getting the parties involved to agree on mutually convenient locations to meet.
“Ethnic armed groups have often been unable to attend talks in placed designated by the government,” he said. “The government can’t go where ethnic armed groups can go, so this has delayed [the process], but they eventually agreed on Kengtung after some negotiation.”
Given the severity of ongoing clashes in both Shan and Rakhine state, the meeting participants will not likely reach an agreement to end the hostilities, said military and political analyst Maung Maung Soe.
“The fighting will continue,” he said. “Intense fighting has occurred in Rakhine state with attacks on a strategic hill on which government troops are stationed, so I don’t see that the fighting will ease up.”
“Talks may be possible amid intense fighting, [but] it will be difficult to discuss a cease-fire in Rakhine state,” he said. “It’s impossible for them to come to terms unless one or the other genuinely compromises.”

An alliance of ethnic armed organizations agreed on Thursday to meet with Myanmar government peace negotiators in war-torn Shan state on Saturday to discuss a possible end to recent clashes with national troops, following an assurance from neighboring China that the rebels will be safe during the talks, those with knowledge of the matter said.
The four groups that comprise the Northern Alliance — the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Arakan Army (AA), will hold discussions with members of the Myanmar Peace Commission (MPC) in the eastern Shan town of Kengtung, sources said.
The TNLA, MNDAA, and AA have been engaged in fierce clashes with Myanmar forces since Aug. 15 when they launched coordinated attacks on five locations in northern Shan state and Mandalay region, killing 15 Myanmar soldiers, policemen, and civilians. The KIA was not involved in the attacks.
The three ethnic armies said they conducted the armed assaults in retaliation for offensives by Myanmar soldiers against them in areas under their control.
The attacks sparked fresh fighting in Shan’s Kutkai, Muse, Lashio, and Kyaukme townships, forcing thousands of villagers to flee their homes and breaching a temporary cease-fire that the Myanmar military declared in five of its military command regions, including Shan state.
The cease-fire expires on Aug. 31, the day of the meeting.
The groups decided to participate in the meeting after China said it would guarantee them safety during the talks amid heightened mutual distrust on both sides because of the hostilities.
Sun Guoxiang, special envoy for Asian affairs from China’s foreign ministry, met last week with the ethnic armies to tell them that Beijing did not accept the armed conflict, which has increased instability in the border region, and pressured them to stop fighting ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1.
“We agreed to meet because the Chinese government said it would be responsible for safety during the Kengtung talks,” said AA spokesman Khine Thukha, adding that the Arakan force would be represented by AA deputy chief Major General Nyo Tun Aung at the meeting.
“The talks will focus on a bilateral [cease-fire] agreement,” he said. “We believe the talks will be constructive if there is a sincere will for having peace in the nation. But they [government negotiators] will be the ones who destroy the peace process should they force what they want.”
The ruling civilian-led National League for Democracy (NLD) government under leader Aung San Suu Kyi wants to end decades of civil war in the county to move ahead with the creation of a federal democratic union.
But the process has stalled, and only 10 of Myanmar’s more than 20 ethnic armies have signed the government’s nationwide cease-fire agreement (NCA).
‘Fighting will continue’
The members of the Northern Alliance have not signed truces with the government and continue to engage in sporadic fighting with Myanmar forces in their quest for greater autonomy and ethnic minority rights within a federal system.
When the Northern Alliance met informally with the MPC earlier this year, however, the ethnic armies expressed a willingness to sign bilateral peace pacts with the Myanmar military before holding discussions on whether to join the NCA. They exchanged further proposals in subsequent meetings in two different towns in Shan state in April and June.
One of the sticking points in the discussions has been the government’s insistence that the AA stop its military operations in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, and limit its activities to Laiza, headquarters of its Northern Alliance partner, the KIA, since the AA was formed a decade ago to wage war against the national military.
Hostilities between the AA and Myanmar forces intensified in northern Rakhine state in late 2018 and again in January, when Arakan fighters attacked police outposts. Ongoing clashes have driven tens of thousands of civilians from their homes, and left dozens of others dead and injured.
San Aung from the Peace-Talk Creation Group said another bone of contention has been getting the parties involved to agree on mutually convenient locations to meet.
“Ethnic armed groups have often been unable to attend talks in placed designated by the government,” he said. “The government can’t go where ethnic armed groups can go, so this has delayed [the process], but they eventually agreed on Kengtung after some negotiation.”
Given the severity of ongoing clashes in both Shan and Rakhine state, the meeting participants will not likely reach an agreement to end the hostilities, said military and political analyst Maung Maung Soe.
“The fighting will continue,” he said. “Intense fighting has occurred in Rakhine state with attacks on a strategic hill on which government troops are stationed, so I don’t see that the fighting will ease up.”
“Talks may be possible amid intense fighting, [but] it will be difficult to discuss a cease-fire in Rakhine state,” he said. “It’s impossible for them to come to terms unless one or the other genuinely compromises.”

Title: In Myanmar, a unity still out of reach | Lowy Institute
Published daily by theLowy Institute
Perpetual conflicts put Aung San Suu Kyi’s peace plan – and political future – on shaky ground.
In January 2018, the Arakan Army, the newest ethnic-based militia in Myanmar, released avideoon YouTube and elsewhere of its cadres kitted out in camouflage, armed with modern weapons, and looking extremely disciplined.
“The Arakan Army are soldiers from the indigenous population of Arakan State. These soldiers, men and women, lay the groundwork for defence of their people and nation,” a message states alongside the video.
Arakan is the historical name for Rakhine, the Myanmar state whose northern region abuts the border with Bangladesh. Rakhine state has been ripped apart over the past seven years, first by sectarian violence fomented by radical Buddhist monks, and then by the country’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw. It remains one of the poorest regions of Myanmar, despite its extraordinary resource wealth.
Conveniently, Suu Kyi is refusing to engage with the Arakan Army as part of the peace process, knowing full well they would become yet another group officially refusing to play ball.
The 12-minute video was a clear statement of intent, a message to the country’s civilian and military leaders that it would take on the Tatmadaw, which it described as an “invader”.
And so it has transpired.
Since the video emerged, the Arakan Army has ramped up its operations, launching a string of increasingly deadly raids in both Rakhine state and Chin state to its north, and sparking concern across the border in Bangladesh and India.
Their emergence has put another spoke in Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s troubled peace plan, known as the 21st Century Panglong Peace Conference, named after the project that was left incomplete when her father Aung San, the architect of Burmese independence, was assassinated in 1947. It also underscores the reality, seldom acknowledged, that the violence that has roiled the region – and has seen more than 700,000 Rohingya flee the country in the past two years – has not just two sides, but three.
The ethnic Arakanese, who are predominantly Buddhist, have been resisting outside rulers for centuries – against the Bamar of central Myanmar’s Konbaung Kingdom in 18th century, the British in the 19th century, and the Japanese during the Second World War.
Following Burma’s independence in 1948, they returned once more to conflict with the Bamar (the country’s dominant ethnic group), and increasingly with the Rohingya, whose numbers had increased under the British as they migrated from present-day Bangladesh in search of work.
The Arakan Army was formed in Myanmar’s north in 2009 with the apparent backing of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), as well as the United Wa State Army (UWSA), Myanmar’s largest ethnic militia. Its fighters cut their teeth fighting in Kachin and neighbouring Shan state, in concert with the KIA, UWSA, and other smaller militias.
The group’s modern equipment and professional discipline, as well as the high production values of its video messages, has led more than a few observers to speculate whether it has the backing of elements in China, which lies to the north of the Kachin and Shan states. There are also reports it has sourced arms from the UWSA and possibly Indian hill tribe militias.
The aim of the peace plan is to finally quell the decades of on-again, off-again civilian wars that have torn apart the seven ethnic-based states that surround the centre of the country. The plan has been buffeted by the ongoing conflict in Kachin state and the Rohingya exodus – blame for both of which lies at the feet of the Tatmadaw, effectively the senior partner in an uneasy governing coalition over which Suu Kyi has no control.
Conveniently, she is refusing to engage with the Arakan Army as part of the peace process, knowing full well they would become yet another group officially refusing to play ball.
Peace was one of the central planks of Suu Kyi’s landslide 2015 election victory, but she has failed to build, in any meaningful way, on the start made by her military predecessor, President Thein Sein, who signed truces with a range of previously hostile militias. As a result, she has squandered a significant amount of goodwill in the ethnic states.
In turn, this failure has changed the political calculus in the country as it approaches the next poll, at the end of 2020. By-elections over the past two years have shown support in the ethnic states, including in Rakhine, drifting away from Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) to more localized ethnic-based parties. These, in turn, are beginning to coalesce around an alliance of like-minded parties keen to push the NLD towards outright support for a truly federated model of Myanmar.
This vision, after all, was part of the original promise of Aung San – also undelivered. If his daughter can bring herself to back such a plan for the country, she might find that the peace process has a realistic path forward. Indeed, she should – politics, as they say, is the art of the possible, and embracing a broader coalition of parties is the surest way the NLD can keep control of the civilian government at next year’s poll and consolidate at least the beginnings of democracy.

Title: 'We're not afraid to lead': Myanmar’s displaced find a new voice | Conflict and arms | The Guardian
Fearful for their safety, many of the 241,000 people forced from their homes by conflict in Myanmar are reluctant to go back. Now campaigners are mobilising to resist organised returns
Bawk Nu Awng hasn’t been home since 2011. All three of the villages where she spent her childhood have been destroyed.
“War hit wherever my family lived,” she said. “I feel like it is my responsibility to engage in all matters related to peace.”
Now aged 21, Bawk Nu Awng, from Kachin inMyanmar, has emerged as a spokesperson among youth displaced by conflict.
When Aung San Suu Kyi took power in 2016, her party, the National League for Democracy, pledged to prioritise ending conflict in Myanmar. Yet the country’s various ethnic groups continue to fight for increased federal autonomy.
In Rakhine state, conflict is escalating between Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, and the rebel Arakan Army. Nationwide,an estimated 241,000 peoplelike Bawk Nu Awngremain in camps,including more than 97,000 in Kachinstate.
Camps for internally displaced people are the most visible evidence of Myanmar’s ongoing strife. With elections coming up next year, political momentum to send displaced people home has accelerated.
Kachin, which shares a border with China’s Yunnan province, is a strategic area for China’sbelt and road initiative, a global development strategy that includes a multi-billion pound China-Myanmar economic corridor.In March, Yunnan officials met with the influential Kachin Baptist Convention; support for returns and a peace agreement was encouraged, with the Chinese contingent suggesting stability could bring investment and development.
In December, the Tatmadaw offered a short unilateral ceasefire, since extended to 31 August, to three ethnic armies in northern Myanmar including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).
Shortly after the announcement, the first organised returns occurred, theTatmadaw accompanying a group ofdisplaced people back to the village of Nam San Yang, despite having deactivated land mines only weeks before. Talks have since been held between the government and the Kachin Humanitarian Concern Committee, a group headed by church leaders that mediates on returns. No displaced people have been included in the meetings.
A UN survey of 1,123 IDP households in Kachin found that while 65% had a long-term intention to return home, only 5% felt they could. Security fears were cited as the main reason.
In early June, longtime activist Lum Zawng, 30, brought together 43 young displaced people in the state capital, Myitkyina, to discuss their perspective on returns. Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: “We urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.”
The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied. It also stated that displaced people should not be used for political, economic or social advantage.
Nawng Lat, who is from Nam San Yang village, was not part of the group that returned. He is eager to go home, but only when conditions are right. When fighting resumed eight years ago, he never imagined living in a camp for so long. “My first thought was that the war would last a few months,” he says. “After about three years, everything became unsure. I wondered why it was happening, why we couldn’t go back.”
Now he isamong more than 38,000displaced people living in areas outside the government’s jurisdiction. With limited access to higher education and jobs, many young people leave for China in search of livelihoods, where they are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse.
“The longer we stay in IDP camps, the more problems we face,” he says. “I don’t want returns to happen under pressure. I’m not saying we don’t want to go back; actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible. It’s been eight years since we have been displaced and we have lost so many things related to our education and development. We will only return after we have a security guarantee.”
Bawk Nu Awng wants a guarantee that landmines have been cleared: “Currently, it is like they want us to stay in a house that is not fully built. When it rains, it will leak. Only after they have fully built the house should we stay in it. There needs to be trust.
“I would like both of the militaries [Tatmadaw and KIA] to clear the landmines that are in our land, and I only want to go back after we have official peace.”
In June, the activists staged a publicdrama performanceto commemorate the war’s eighth anniversary. Pau Lu and fellow organiser Seng Nu Pan informed the authorities yet, moments before the performance, police turned up claiming that extra permissions were required. The event was moved and went ahead, but Pau Lu and Seng Nu Pan were charged with holding an unauthorised protest. They now face a maximum three-month prison sentence in the ongoing case.
The incident is one of several in which activists have faced criminal charges. In April last yea,r Lum Zawng and fellow activists Zau Jat and Nang Pu received a six-month prison sentence for defaming the Tatmadaw by leading a demonstration demanding safe passage and humanitarian access to 2,000 villagers trapped during a period of escalated fighting.
Bawk Nu Awng says fear makes people reluctant to act: “Some are afraid of engaging in politics … My parents don’t want me to participate because they are afraid I will get shot or arrested.”
Released during an annual presidential amnesty, Lum Zawng said arresting activists serves as a “psychological threat”.
Pau Lu said they would not back down. “Even if [Seng Nu Pan and I] get arrested, the youth won’t stop. We have plenty of people who can step up in our place.”
Seng Nu Pan says arrests only “push us to do more”
“We have to practise our freedom of expression. If we don’t express what is happening, [no one will] know,” says Lum Zawng. “The young generation can change … We’re not afraid to lead a movement.”
