Title: AUDIO: Atiku's Spokesman Slams 'Janjaweed Keyamo' And The ‘Jagaban That Says Jagbajantis About Everybody' | Sahara Reporters
“I have been inundated by calls from fans, lovers and associates of our campaign, wondering whether the thunder has struck and I’ve said what the manipulative Janjaweed of Muhammadu Buhari has been pushing about. That interview was an interview conducted on BBC, where I was reacting to the fact that it is no longer possible, that statistically, Buhari can no longer defeat us in an election. Obviously, it is their stock in trade to manipulate things, to do innuendos, to tell lies, and to be looking for a messiah when they had already killed the Lord Jesus Christ with their mouth," Showunmi said.
Display in Video SectionOnTopicsVIDEO NEWS
Segun Showunmi, spokesman of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Organisation, has released an audio recording debunking the claim by Festus Keyamo, spokesman of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, admitting the “impossibility” of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) winning the presidential election.
In the audio recording published on his Twitter page on Tuesday, he referred to Keyamo as President Muhammadu Buhari’s “manipulative Janjaweed”.
According to www.britannica.com, “Janjaweed, also spelled Janjawid, is an Arab militia active in Sudan, particularly in the Darfur region. The militia’s name is thought by many to be derived from the Arabic jinnī (spirit) and jawad (horse), although its etymological origins are not completely clear.”
Bola Tinubu, the APC National Leader, as well as the party were not left out of his rant, as he ridiculed the APC presidential rally held in Ogun State on Monday, during which various objects were hurled at the APC leaders.
His words: “I have been inundated by calls from fans, lovers and associates of our campaign, wondering whether the thunder has struck and I’ve said what the manipulative Janjaweed of Muhammadu Buhari has been pushing about.
"That interview was an interview conducted on BBC, where I was reacting to the fact that it is no longer possible, that statistically, Buhari can no longer defeat us in an election. Obviously, it is their stock in trade to manipulate things, to do innuendos, to tell lies, and to be looking for a messiah when they had already killed the Lord Jesus Christ with their mouth.
“That said and that completed, they have elevated propaganda, telling lies and blackmail to state policies. Little wonder, nobody believes them now. How are the mighty fallen! The people, who four years ago, will move through the town, and even the trees and the leaves and everything around there will shout ‘Sai Baba’, suddenly have become the people that are pelleted with stones and ‘pure water’ in their own rally like what we saw in Ogun State; have become a people that cannot even be able to get a reasonable crowd in the land of their leader, the so-called Jagaban, who doesn’t know what he’s doing; that opens his mouth to say ‘jagbajantis’ about everybody but himself.
“It is this same tendency that has now allowed them to be doing cut-and-paste manipulation of edited words; that will not save them. I repeat: It is statistically impossible now for Muhammadu Buhari to beat Atiku.”
Noting that at the time he made the comment about two weeks ago, the APC had not conducted rallies in states such as Lagos and Ogun, he continued: “It is clear to me that by their estimation that I know cannot be faulted, it is even bigger now. For the numbers I thought they were going to get in Kano, I have now adjusted it significantly, because there is no evidence they can win anything. This is the 13th hour. All that is required and all that Nigerians expect is for Nigeria to see a peaceful, transparent, fair and credible election.”

Title: US, UK and EU Are 'Partners in Crime' Turning a 'Blind Eye' to Crisis in Sudan - 05.02.2019, Sputnik International
75yo Bashir has been in power since a coup in 1989 but in the last two months there have been almost daily demonstrations calling for him to go.
Crowds of Sudanese protesters chanted "freedom, freedom," as riot police fired tear gas on anti-government rallies in the capital, Khartoum and the city of Omdurman, on the other side of the river Nile, on Monday, 4 February.
Many of the protesters chanted the name of Ahmed Khair, a 33-year-old school teacher who was detained last week and died in custody on Friday, 1 February.

He was believed to be the 53rd protester killed sinceprotests beganon 19 December, initially as a result of an increase in the price of bread.
Amjad Farid, a spokesman for Sudan Change Now, said there had been more protests on Tuesday, 5 February, especially among hospital doctors, teachers and university lecturers.
"People are demanding their basic rights — freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly — but they also want a respectable government which actually represents them," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.
He said the government of President Omar al-Bashir, which had been in power for 30 years, had failed.
We are outraged by the death of teacher Ahmed Alkhair on 2 Feb, after a week in detention in Kassala,#Sudan. Autopsy report shows visible signs of torture. We call for an immediate and independent investigation into his death and that those found responsible are held to account.pic.twitter.com/JDt0G0jn7A
​Bashir, who came to power in an Islamist-backed military coup in 1989, is considering running for a third presidential term in an election next year.
"It's a failure over three decades. It's not about ideology or religion. It's about a material failure, the collapse of the economy and the loss of (largely Christian and animist) South Sudan because they could not accommodate other peoples and of course the corruption of the Bashir family and the establishment," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.
Dr. Farid said 3,000 political prisoners were being held in Sudan, while another 3.5 million Sudanese had become refugees.
"It is an illegitimate regime and its action against its own people are illegal. Who is going to run for political office when the intelligence service can detain people without time limits? Bashir needs to go and then a transitional government is needed to allow for a new government," he told Sputnik.

​The protests are being led by the Sudanese Professionals Association but many in the Sudanese government are seeking to portray it as a disagreement between the older and younger generations.
"The recent incidents show that there is a division between the young generation and others within families. This is something that needs to be solved by dialogue with the youth," Defence Minister Awad Ibnouf told army officers in Khartoum on 4 February.
His comments come days after the army's chief of staff, General Kamal Abdelmarouf, said the army "will not allow the Sudanese state to collapse or fall into chaos."

​"Ibnouf is trying to portray it as a generation gap but the protesters are across all ages, it's not just young people. We have people in their 70s chanting for change," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.
He said it was not just the army which was propping up al-Bashir and his National Congress Party government.
Dr. Farid said one of the pro-NCP militias, which was previously known as the "janjaweed" and was notorious for atrocities in Darfur, had been given the task ofcracking down on migrantsheading for Egypt and Europe and was being supported in this by the European Union, which was keen to stem the flow of migrants.
"People are fleeing Africa because of the tyranny and mismanagement of the ruling regimes and the corrupt leaders," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.
Dr. Farid said the EU's policy was both absurd and hypocritical because most of those who were fleeing Sudan were doing so because they had lost hope in the country due to the government.
I am delighted to have hosted Sudan's Vice President Osman Mohammed Yousif today at State House, Nairobi, who delivered a special message from President Omar Al-Bashir. I am happy to know that Sudan is handling matters well and that the situation in the country is under control.pic.twitter.com/dAfWTAOXRW
​He said the UK, the US and the EU were currently berating the Venezuelan government and trying to oust President Maduro, while "turning a blind eye" to al-Bashir.
"The US, the UK and the EU are partners in crime with Bashir," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.
"The EU is turning a blind eye because he has promised to stem the migrants and the international media should be ashamed of itself. Their silence about what is going on in Sudan is shameful. The government is committing criminal offences on a daily basis, including killing doctors for helping injured protesters," Dr. Farid told Sputnik.

Title: Press freedom watchdog: ‘At least 79 journalists arrested in two months of protests in Sudan’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online

The number of journalists arrested in the course of anti-government protests in Sudan is at least 79, International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reported at a press conference in Paris on Tuesday.
The number of journalists arrested in the course of anti-government protests in Sudan is at least 79, International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reported at a press conference in Paris on Tuesday.
RSF has so far registered a total of 79 media personnelarrestssince the protests against an increase in the price of bread began on 19 December and then quickly grew into angry demonstrations against the regime.
Thesesystematic arrestshave targeted not only reporters covering protests in almost all parts of the country but also journalists who themselves dared to protest against the regime’s policy of censorship and arrests of journalists with the aim of restricting coverage of the protests.
RSF denounced theregime’s targeting of journalistsin a press release on 15 January, in which it reported that 28 journalists had been arrested the previous day while staging a protest against the repeated press freedom violations.
A total of 16 journalists were being held at the height of the crackdown at the start of February. All had been detained for more than 48 hours and some for several weeks. They have all been freed in the past few days after President Omar al-Bashirmet with a number of newspaper editorson 6 February.
“The release of detained journalists is far from ending the crackdown on the media,” said Arnaud Froger, the head of RSF’s Africa desk. ”We call for an end to all forms of censorship, including an end to the repeated seizures of newspaper issues and the dropping of all judicial proceedings against media personnel. There will be no resolution of the crisis in Sudan if journalists are not free to cover what is happening.”
Print media throttled by censorship
The all-powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) continues to ban and seize newspaper issues. RSF has registered a total of 63 bans and seizures since 19 December.Al-Jareeda, one of the most-targeted newspapers, has managed to publish an average of less than one issue every two days since the start of the crackdown. This extreme censorship has already cost the Sudanese print media tens of thousands of euros.
Several journalists, includingAl-Tayaareditor Osman Mirghani,Al-Tayaarreporter Shamael Al-Noor and freelancer Durra Gambo, are being prosecuted for their coverage of the protests. Yousra Elbagir, a reporter for foreign media outlets such asCNN, theBBCandChannel 4, says she hasleft Sudanafter being threatened with charges carrying a possible death penalty.
Neither the National Council for Press and Publications (NCPP), which regulates the Sudanese media, nor information minister Bushara Guma Aror responded to RSF’s phone calls and messages.

Title: 79 journalistes arrêtés au Soudan depuis le début des manifestations, selon RSF
15 Février 2019
Paris, France, 14  février (Infosplusgabon) - Au moins 79 journalistes ont été arrêtés depuis près de deux derniers mois en marge du mouvement de protestation dans plusieurs villes soudanaises contre le régime du Président Oumar El Bechir après la hausse du prix du pain, a indiqué Reporters sans frontières (RSF).

La campagne d’interpellations systématiques, a souligné RSF, a non seulement touché les reporters qui couvraient les rassemblements un peu partout dans le pays mais également les journalistes qui ont osé protester contre la politique de censure et d'arrestations menée par les autorités pour empêcher les informations de circuler.

Début février, a indiqué l'organisation pour la défense des médias, 16 journalistes se trouvant depuis plus de 48 heures et pour certains depuis plusieurs semaines dans les geôles du régime soudanais ont été libérés au cours des derniers jours après une rencontre entre le Président Omar el-Béchir et plusieurs responsables de journaux.

Néanmoins, a tempéré RSF, le puissant service de renseignement et de sécurité soudanais (NISS) poursuit les confiscations de journaux et les interdictions de parution alors que plusieurs journalistes font par ailleurs l'objet de poursuites judiciaires pour leur couverture des événements.

"La libération des journalistes détenus est loin d'avoir mis fin à la répression contre la presse. Nous demandons la fin de la censure et notamment les confiscations de journaux à répétition ainsi que l'abandon de toutes les poursuites contre les professionnels de l'information. Il n'y aura pas de sortie de crise au Soudan sans journalistes libres d'y témoigner de l'actualité", a déclaré Arnaud Froger, responsable du bureau Afrique de RSF.

Depuis le début des manifestations contre la hausse du prix du pain le 19 décembre 2018 qui se sont rapidement muées en mouvement de colère générale contre le régime soudanais, RSF avait notamment dénoncé une « chasse aux journalistes » du régime après les arrestations de 28 professionnels des médias, interpellés alors qu'ils participaient à un rassemblement pour dénoncer la récurrence des atteintes à la liberté de la presse dans leur pays.

♦ Al Bashir declares State of Emergency, restrictive orders, dissolves govt
February 26 – 2019 KHARTOUMYesterday, the Sudanese president Omar Al Bashir issued four Emergency Orders that further restrict public and press freedoms such as gatherings, in addition to handling of foreign exchange and selling of fuel. The four emergency orders will also add penalties to anyone who violates them, in an attempt to halt the popular protests against the regime of Al Bashir that started in December.
The announcement follows Al Bashir’s declaration ofa State of Emergencyon Friday, in which he dissolved the national Council of Ministers, relieved the Walis (state governors) and dissolved state governments, appointing high-ranking police and military officers as the Walis.
According to the Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, Bintou Keita, who briefed the UN Security Council on the situation in Darfur on Monday, the impact of the recent developments in Khartoum on the dynamics related to the peace process in Darfur “is yet to be assessed”.
In a reaction on the Emergency Orders, opposition and civil society groups say that Sudanese people intend to stand up for their human rights during large-scale demonstrations on Thursday February 28.

♦ Demands against Port Sudan privatisation grow
February 24 – 2019 PORT SUDANCargo port workers in Port Sudan gathered in front of the harbour's southern and northern ports in the past week, to escalate their demands against the privatisation agreement which the management has struck with a Philippine company. For several days theystaged strikesto demand the cancellation of the privatisation contract signed with International Container Terminal Services Inc (ICTSI).
“Hundreds of workers in the ports went out in a unified march that toured all sections of the ports,” an eyewitness told Radio Dabanga. Starting January, the strikes have paralysed the southern port. The Committee Against Privatisation and opponents fear that ICTSI will absorb over 1,000 jobs in the port and will drop the services that the port previously provided to port workers, including health centres and schools. The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there will be no displacement or damage to the workers.
ICTSI was already granted management rights of the container terminal at the southern port for four years, however, many workers reject the new contract because they claim ICTSI has been operating there in previous years without making any developments.

Title: Sudanese Secret Police Asked to Identify 'General of Death' in Italy - 06.02.2019, Sputnik International
The man — who prosecutors say isMedhanie Yehdego Mered— has always claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and on Tuesday, 5 February, Italian prosecutors announced they would be calling two senior officers from the Sudanese secret police to testify in the case.
Mered, 35, is accused of running a people trafficking network which sent thousands of migrants across the Mediterranean, mainly via Libya, to Europe. They often used overloaded or unseaworthy boats which sank, killing hundreds.
The network recruited migrants in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya, all of whom paid large sums of money to the traffickers in the hope of starting a new life in Europe.
— Patrick Kingsley (@PatrickKingsley)10 June 2016
Mered ended up on an international wanted list after being identified as the man who organised the packing of migrants onto a boat that sank off Italy'sLampedusaisland in 2013, killing at least 360 people.
UK's National Crime Agency Tapped Trafficker's Phones
Medhanie was the name flagged by Britain's National Crime Agency in 2016 when it heard someone going by that name calling the tapped phone of a suspected smuggler in Libya.
Prosecutors said two Eritrean translators had testified to police the arrested man's voice matched a 2014 recording of "the General" captured by wiretap, though standard voice recognition software failed to produce a result.
The Eritrean has been in jail in Sicily sinceDecember 2016and has repeatedly claimed the authorities have got the wrong man.
He claims his real name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe and he is a 29-year-old carpenter who was himself a migrant.His lawyer, Michele Calantropo, said the only thing his client shared with the trafficker was a first name.
But the Italian prosecutors insist they have got the right man.
Mr. Calantropo said he had "no idea" what to expect from the Sudanese policemen, who played a key role in tracking down and arresting his client.
"Even if they do not claim he is Mered, they will say he is a bad man who deserves to be in prison," Mr. Calantropo told the AFP news agency.
Can UK and Italy Trust the Sudanese?
Italy, Sudan and Britain hailed Mered's arrest as the first big pay-off from a new joint operation which was targeting people smugglers.
On Tuesday, 5 February, Amjad Farid, a spokesman forSudan Change Now, said the EU and the UK were "partners in crime" with the government of Sudanese dictator, Omar al-Bashir, and were paying him to use militias — including the dreaded Janjaweed — to stop migrants.
Mr. Calantropo toldThe Guardianthe decision to let officers from Sudan's secret police give evidence at a trial in Italy raised a "grave ethical question".
Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2009 on war crimes charges over the long-running conflict in Darfur and was also indicted the following year for genocide.




Title: 79 journalists arrested in Sudan, according to  RSF
19 Février 2019
Paris, France, February 19 (Infosplusgabon) - At least 79 journalists, including those covering the protest by demonstrators over hike in the price of bread, have been arrested over the past two months,  Reporters sans frontières (RSF) said on Thursday in a communiqué.

The protests were held line with several Sudanese cities against the regime of president Oumar El Bashir.

RSF says that authorities also arrested journalists who protested against censorship and arrests carried out to prevent information from spreading.

The media defence organisation says that in early February, 16 journalists detained for several weeks, were released over the past days after negotiations between the president and media dircetors.

RSF says that nevertheless, the powerful Sudanese intelligent and security service (NISS) continues confiscating newspapers as several journalists are facing court cased for covering the protests.

‘’The release of the detained journalists is far from putting an end to the suppression against the media. We are waiting for the end of the censorship and particularly the repeated confiscations of newspapers, as well as the abandonment of all legal procedures against the information and communication professionals. There will be no way out of this crisis in Sudan without freeing the journalists," said Arnaud Froger, responsible of the RSF Africa office.

Since the beginning of the demonstrations on 19 December 2018, that quickly chaged into angry demonstrations, RSF had particularly denounced a ‘’journalist hunt’’ by the regime after the arrest of 28 media professionals, arrested as they were taking part in a gathering to denounce the recurrence of the breaches against press freedom in their country.

The Sudanese Journalists’ Network said that 79 journalists have been arrested since December, including some who have spent a month or more in the prisons and detention centres.
The Sudanese Journalists’ Network saysthat 79 journalists have been arrested since December, including some who have spent a month or more in the prisons and detention centres.
The network said in a statement that there are newspapers such asEl Jareeda,El Midan,Akhbar El Watan, andEl Baathhave not been accessible to the readers for weeks.
The director of El Ashigaa printing house, Mohamed Widaa has pointed to the increase of the price for a ton of newsprint paper from SDG 75,000 to SDG 93,000 and described the increase as a disaster of the press industry.
Widaa said after the meeting with eight publishers of newspapers printed that the cost of printing of one copy will increase from nine Pounds to more than 10 Pounds.
He attributed the reluctance of citizens to buy newspapers for not keeping pace with the street and ignoring the protests and killings.
He criticised the authorities’ insistence on the prior security censorship and the removal of the news of daily movement from the newspapers ofEl Jareeda,El Midan,Akhbar El WatanandEl Baathand turning the agents of the authorities to the editors of newspapers.
The Network’s statement echoes theassessment released by International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF)last week.

Title: Sudan Opposition to keep up protests despite emergency
KHARTOUM: Sudan’s main opposition party on Saturday dismissed President Omar al-Bashir’s declaration of a state of emergency, saying protesters would keep up their campaign until his three-decade rule was ended.On Friday, Bashir imposed a nationwide state of emergency and dissolved the federal and provincial governments in a bid to quell two months of almost daily demonstrations that have rocked his iron-fisted regime.“Dissolving the government and imposing a state of emergency is nothing but a repetition of this regime’s failures,” the opposition National Umma Party said in a statement.“Nothing will satisfy the people who are taking to the streets except the overthrow of this regime.”The National Umma Party, whose leader Sadiq al-Mahdi was Sudan’s elected prime minister when Bashir seized power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989, has thrown its weight behind the protests.The party has signed up to a “Document for Freedom and Change” also signed by the Communist Party and the political wings of several rebels groups in Sudan’s outlying regions.The text sets out a vision for a post-Bashir future with a reformed justice system and a raft of measures to halt Sudan’s precipitous economic decline, which has been the driving force behind the protests.A government decision to triple the price of bread was the immediate trigger for the first demonstration in the farming town of Atbara on December 19 and the protests swiftly mushroomed as they struck a chord with the large numbers of Sudanese who have seen their purchasing power plummet in recent years.The protest campaign has been led by the Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of teachers, doctors and engineers, who have been among the worst hit.Officials say 31 people have died in protest-related violence so far. Human Rights Watch says at least 51 people have been killed.Sudan editor detained after comment on emergency: Sudanese security agents have detained a prominent newspaper editor after he made televised comments on President Omar al-Bashir’s decision to impose a state of emergency and dissolve the government, his brother said Saturday.Osman Mirghani, editor-in-chief of independent daily Al-Tayar, was taken away by security agents from his office late on Friday, Ali Mirghani told AFP.He said security agents detained his brother soon after his comments on Bashir’s latest measures to quell weeks of protests against his three-decade-old rule.“Soon after the president announced the emergency, my brother was speaking about it on an Arab channel,” he said.“After that he was taken away from his office. We don’t know his whereabouts until now.”Agents from the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) also confiscated the entire print run of Saturday’s edition of Al-Tayar, he said.Police and security officials were unavailable for comment.Sky News Arabia screened an interview with Mirghani on Friday evening in which he was asked whether Bashir’s new measures would extinguish public anger.He responded that they would instead “spark a new wave” of protests and send a message that the public “can exert more pressure to achieve its goal of removing this regime”.Mirghani, a US-educated engineer turned journalist, has often been targeted by security agents, who have detained him several times, confiscated copies of his newspaper or barred its publication without giving any reason.The NISS regularly seizes entire print runs of newspapers over articles it deems inappropriate, especially those criticising the authorities or government’s policies.Sudanese authorities have launched a sweeping crackdown against protests that broke out in December, jailing protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists.Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says at least 79 journalists have been arrested since the protests erupted on December 19.Sudan is ranked 174th out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2018 World Press Freedom Index.Late on Friday, Bashir declared a state of emergency across the country in an attempt to quell the demonstrations.He also dissolved the cabinet and provincial governments of all 18 provinces.Protests erupted in Sudan after a government decision to triple the price of bread.They swiftly escalated into anti-government demonstrations with protesters calling for Bashir to resign.\
On Friday, Bashir imposed a nationwide state of emergency and dissolved the federal and provincial governments in a bid to quell two months of almost daily demonstrations that have rocked his iron-fisted regime.“Dissolving the government and imposing a state of emergency is nothing but a repetition of this regime’s failures,” the opposition National Umma Party said in a statement.“Nothing will satisfy the people who are taking to the streets except the overthrow of this regime.”The National Umma Party, whose leader Sadiq al-Mahdi was Sudan’s elected prime minister when Bashir seized power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989, has thrown its weight behind the protests.The party has signed up to a “Document for Freedom and Change” also signed by the Communist Party and the political wings of several rebels groups in Sudan’s outlying regions.The text sets out a vision for a post-Bashir future with a reformed justice system and a raft of measures to halt Sudan’s precipitous economic decline, which has been the driving force behind the protests.A government decision to triple the price of bread was the immediate trigger for the first demonstration in the farming town of Atbara on December 19 and the protests swiftly mushroomed as they struck a chord with the large numbers of Sudanese who have seen their purchasing power plummet in recent years.The protest campaign has been led by the Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of teachers, doctors and engineers, who have been among the worst hit.Officials say 31 people have died in protest-related violence so far.

Title: Hemetti calls for code of conduct to achieve Sudan's transition, complains of marginalization - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Mohamed Hamdan Daglo Hemetti (Reuters file photo)February 15, 2020 (KHARTOUM) – Sudan’s leading member of the Transitional Sovereign Council Mohamed Hamdan Daglo “Hemetti” complained of his marginalization by Hamdok government and called for code of conduct to enhance confidence with the ruling coalition Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC).
Hemetti who is the General Commander Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was interviewed by Sudan 24 TV confessed for the first time his feeling of rejection by the Sudanese street.
This confession comes after several attempts to organize public relations campaigns to improve his image following the attack involving his militiamen on the pro-democracy sit-in on 3 June 2019.
During the talk show, Hemetti denied doing any efforts to obstruct the action of the civilian-led government which faces huge economic burden due to the lack of financial resources.
“In a joint meeting of the Council of Sovereignty, the Council of Ministers and the Forces for Freedom and Change some voices within the FFC said that they do not even want to hear from us and even they do not want us to interfere,” he disclosed to express his feeling of mistrust.
The three bodies meet to discuss major issues in the country. They recently met to discuss Entebbe meeting between the head of the Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Hemetti said they have no intention to obstruct or overthrow the civilian government instead he stressed that they are supporters of the democratic transition and want to help to achieve this task.
“From here I am calling for a code of conduct in which we all pledge – as supporters of change and as a sovereign council, a cabinet; FFC and youth – to work for the interest of the country and to focus our efforts get the country out of its crises (…),” he said.
“We are confused about what to do, we not know what we can do. We can help, provide services and take advantage of our relationships, but they do not allow us,” he further said.
Hemetti and his RSF had tried to organize a campaign against the Cholera outbreak and to provide vehicles always to transport people but he and his militiamen were rejected by the FFC forces as they call to speed up the investigation on the bloody raid of 3 June.
Hemetti who appointed by al-Burhan as deputy head of the Sovereign Council even if the position is not in the Constitutional Document said they can use his relations with the Arab United Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to end the current economic crisis.
“We need external support so that we can stand on our own feet. But some people fought all those who support us. they did not allow them to work and kept insulting them day and night,” he stressed.
He recalled that the UAE and Saudi Arabia are the only countries that supported the Sudanese and provided them with three billion.
“If we want to recover and come out of our crises, we must face these people (who identified as some FFC groups) and know where our interest is,” he stressed.

Title: Soudan : la contestation exclut tout dialogue avec Omar el-Béchir
Recevez l'essentiel de l'actualité et restez à jour avec nos newsletters
Les organisateurs des manifestations antigouvernementales au Soudan se disent déterminés à poursuivre la mobilisation jusqu'au renversement du régime.
Miné par une profonde crise économique, le Soudan est secoué depuis le 19 décembre 2018 par des manifestations quasi quotidiennes initialement déclenchées par la décision du gouvernement de tripler le prix du pain.
Ces rassemblements se sont transformés en un vaste mouvement de contestation d'Omar el-Béchir, au pouvoir depuis un coup d'Etat mené en 1989."Le régime doit tomber, c'est notre objectif", a déclaré lors d'une conférence de presse Mohamed Youssef, un porte-parole del'Association des professionnels soudanaisqui est à la pointe de la mobilisation.
Cette organisation, qui regroupe, entre autres, des médecins, des enseignants et des ingénieurs, a tenu le 12 février 2019 sa première conférence depuis le début des protestations, dans les locaux du principal parti d'opposition soudanais, Al-Oumma, dans la ville d'Omdourman, jumelle de la capitale Khartoum.
"Il n'y a aucun moyen de mener un dialogue avec ce régime", a poursuivi ce porte-parole, tandis que des partisans du mouvement chantaient des slogans contre le gouvernement à l'extérieur du bâtiment.
Le parti Al-Oumma, d'accord avec le mouvement, a réitéré son soutien aux manifestants."Nous continuerons ce soulèvement jusqu'à ce que le régime soit renversé", a déclaré sa secrétaire générale, Sara Najdullah, tout en appelant la communauté internationale et les organisations de défense des droits humains à apporter leur soutien afin que la lumière puisse être faite"sur les crimes du régime".
Mohamed Youssef a appelé les formations politiques et les militants à se joindre au mouvement de protestation en signant le"Document pour la liberté et le changement"qui expose, selon lui, les grandes lignes d'un plan de l'après-Béchir, incluant une refonte du système judiciaire et un arrêt du déclin économique du pays.
Le jour même, à Paris, des membres de la société civile soudanaise et française tenaient une conférence de presse appelant à briser le silence sur la répression qui a fait selon eux plus de 60 morts."Nous lançons un appel à la communauté internationale pour qu'elle fasse pression sur le régime, pour qu'il arrête cette violence, ces violations des droits de l'Homme. Et qu'elle punisse les actions perpétrées par le régime contre le peuple soudanais", a déclaré en arabe Ali Haroun, membre de la branche française de la Coordination pour le soutien de la révolution soudanaise.
Malgré ce qui se passe, il y a un silence assourdissant, notamment de la France et de la Commission européenne

Selon Kleiche, membre fondateur du Centre européen pour la paix dans la Corne de l'Afrique,"ce régime s'est vendu à la fois en France et en Europe comme la seule alternative de stabilisation de la région, notamment pour lutter contre l'immigration clandestine".
Mais pour cet universitaire français,"la préservation de la stabilité passe par un changement démocratique"au Soudan."La crainte, ce n'est pas l'effondrement du régime, la crainte, c'est l'effondrement du pays", a-t-il estimé, en rappelant l'exemple de la Libye.
Pour Mohamed Nagi, rédacteur en chef du journal en ligneSudan Tribune, si la Grande-Bretagne ou les Etats-Unis"font pression sur Khartoum", la communauté internationale, après"l'expérience du printemps arabe", a"très peur de la possibilité d'une guerre civile, d'autant plus qu'il y a beaucoup d'armes au Soudan".
Le manque de mobilisation internationale s'explique aussi par la difficulté pour les journalistes de rendre compte de cette crise, ont souligné tous les intervenants.
Du 19 décembre 2018 au 12 février 2019, Reporters sans frontières a recensé 79 arrestations de journalistes et 63 confiscations de journaux, a précisé Arnaud Froger, responsable Afrique de RSF, qui a dénoncé une"mise sous tutelle de l'information".
"Il existe encore des journalistes et une presse au Soudan, il faut les sauver"pour"éviter que le Soudan devienne un trou noir de l'information", a-t-il conclu.

Title: Banned Sudanese newspaper ‘will not endorse disinformation’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) banned the Sudanese El Baath newspaper from appearing on Monday. The editor-in-chief said that this was the ninth time that the security apparatus targeted them.
The National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) banned the SudaneseEl Baathnewspaper from appearing on Monday. The editor-in-chief said that this was the ninth time that the security apparatus targeted them.
Mohamed Widaa,El Baatheditor-in-chief, said that NISS officers prevented the newspaper from being printed until after its news, articles and columns were adapted to adhere to the instructions of the NISS regarding the media coverage of the uprising in Sudan.
Widaa said in a statement online that the newspaper “would not deviate from its professional editorial line and would not be part of the systematic disinformation campaign for readers [by the security apparatus, RD]”.
He said that the newspaper cannot be issued if it were to ignore the demonstrations and the violence against protesters. “The sacrifice made by the newspaper cannot be compared to the sacrifice of a martyr or wounded person who has resisted the regime.”
‘63 newspapers banned’
The number of journalists arrested in the course of anti-government protests in Sudan is at least 79, International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF)reported last week, and the NISS continues to ban and seize newspaper issues.
Last week, journalists Mohamed Ibrahim and Nureldin Jadat, covering the protest forEl Tayyarnewspaper, and journalist Nidal Ajeeb were also detained.
RSF registered a total of 63 bans and seizures since 19 December.El Jareeda, one of the most-targeted newspapers, has managed to publish an average of less than one issue every two days since the start of the crackdown. This extreme censorship has already cost the Sudanese print media tens of thousands of euros.

Title: Reporters Without Borders condemns absurd sentence of Azerbaijani journalist
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemns the absurd suspended sentence of five and a half years in prison that Azerbaijani opposition journalist Mustafa Hajibeyli received yesterday in connection with his coverage of last July’s assassination attempt on the mayor of the western city of Ganja. His conviction must be quashed on appeal, RSF said.
Convicting Hajibeyli on charges of calling for the government’s overthrow, abuse of authority and forgery, the court ruled that he will not have to serve the jail term if he commits no further crime for the next two years, during which he will be under judicial control and banned from travelling abroad. Hajibeyli said he will appeal.The editor of the Bastainfo.com news website, Hajibeyli was convicted over articles that took a critical look at the Ganja mayor’s behaviour prior to the July attempt on his life, and criticized the authorities for failing to intervene to prevent the ensuing violence.
Because of these articles, Bastainfo.com was immediately blockedwithout a court order, although other media outlets had previously published them. During Hajibeyli’s trial, the experts and witnesses produced by the prosecution failed to identify what passages in the articles constituted a call for the government’s overthrow. Independent jurists insist that they contained no such call.
Anar Mammadov, the editor of Criminalaz.сom, a website that has also been blocked, is meanwhile facing up to 12 years in prison on similar charges in a trial that is to resume on 12 March.
“This absurd conviction is just another ploy to intimidate the few critical media remaining in Azerbaijan,” said Johann Bihr, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. “We urge the international community to impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for this crackdown and to condition all financial support for Baku on respect for press freedom and human rights.”
Azerbaijan is ranked 163rd out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2018 World Press Freedom Index. The leading critical media outlets have been silenced or have had to relocate abroad, the main independent websites are blocked, at least ten journalists are currently in prison, and the activities of NGOs that support the media have been criminalized.

Title: With support from WHO, the Ministry of Health to rollout Mobile Phone-Based Surveillance System to every health facility in South Sudan - South Sudan | ReliefWeb
South Sudan+ 1 more
15 February 2019, Juba– In 2016, with support from WHO and partners, South Sudan was the first country in the world to roll out “EWARS in a box,” the early warning, alert and response system (EWARS) that permitted mobile phone-based reporting of priority outbreak-prone diseases from a number of partner-supported health facilities in the conflict-affected areas of the country.
Over the years, the system has served as a key surveillance tool for outbreak-prone diseases (such as measles, viral haemorrhagic fevers, and cholera) and other priority conditions (such as malaria and Guinea worm) in South Sudan, in support of the country’s Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy.
A single “EWARS in a box” kit costs approximately US$ 15 000 and can support surveillance for 50 fixed or mobile sites, or roughly 500 000 people, thus providing early warning of potential disease outbreaks for a mere 3 cents per person. The system also automatically creates weekly national epidemiologic bulletins that summarize the IDSR disease situation across the country.
In 2017 EWARS was installed in every state and county throughout South Sudan, allowing health facilities’ paper-based weekly IDSR forms to be entered electronically at the county level so that higher levels of the health system (state and national) could immediately track disease occurrence and receive alerts about unusual disease patterns in any county in the country.
“Now, the ultimate goal of having each and every health facility in South Sudan enter its IDSR data directly at the facility level is within reach, with the commencement of a nationwide rollout of facility-based EWARS reporting”, said Dr Olu Olushayo, the WHO Country Representative. County by county, facility officers are being trained on how to use the EWARS mobile phones within their health facilities. This will allow instant transmission of every facility’s weekly reports and generation of specific alerts about unusual disease patterns down to individual facilities so that Rapid Response Teams can be immediately activated to investigate and respond to any outbreaks before they spread out of control.
The system will also allow individual health facilities to make urgent reports about any other unusual disease events, including unstructured rumours of disease occurrence in nearby communities (‘Community Event-based Surveillance’); this provides an additional way to alert about outbreaks that are not detected in the health facilities.
As part of South Sudan’s preparedness for possible Ebola virus disease (EVD) importation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the rollout also includes training on how the Event-Based Surveillance feature can be used to report suspected EVD cases. Concurrently, community leaders and the Boma Health Teams are being trained on reporting unusual events to either their local health facility for triggering alerts in EWARS or by calling the national EVD hotline, which will also trigger alerts in EWARS and activate appropriate local Rapid Response Teams.
The EWARS system can integrate with laboratories and can track also outbreaks once they are identified. The EWARS system is also flexible to allow for additional reporting requirements as needed in specific facilities, such as nutritional surveillance, mortality reports, facility service availability monitoring, and others. This increases staff efficiency by limiting the number of different channels through which reporting is done, thereby freeing staff to concentrate on their clinical work while assuring the timeliest transmission of information.
The EWARS mobile reporting rollout in South Sudan is supported by The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of the program to strengthen IDSR in South Sudan.

Title: Ethiopian helicopter crashes at UN compound in disputed Sudan region, killing 3 | Daily Sabah

An Ethiopian military helicopter crashed inside a United Nations peacekeeping force compound in the disputed Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan, killing three crew members and injuring 10 passengers, the U.N. said in a statement Sunday.
The statement said the helicopter was carrying 23 passengers when it crashed on Saturday inside the compound of the U.N. Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), "killing three of its crew members."

"Ten passengers were injured with three in critical condition," it said.
The MI-8 helicopter was carrying Ethiopian troops from Kadugli in Sudan to Abyei, which has been contested since South Sudan gained independence in 2011.

"We are investigating the incident," said UNISFA's acting Head of Mission and Force Commander Major General Gebre Adhana Woldezgu.
Ethiopia is the sole troop contributing country to UNISFA, with some 4,500 soldiers on the ground.
The U.N. Security Council has warned that the situation in Abyei and along the Sudan-South Sudan border "continues to constitute a serious threat to international peace," and called on the two countries to show concrete progress on border demarcation and monitoring.
South Sudan seceded from Sudan in an acrimonious split following a 2011 referendum.

The two nations have disputes over several issues including the status of disputed oil-rich Abyei area and South Sudan's alleged support to Sudanese rebels.

Title: Unification of armed forces will be “a decisive milestone” for this Revitalized Agreement, says Interim JMEC Chairperson - South Sudan | ReliefWeb

Unification of armed forces will be “a decisive milestone” for this Revitalized Agreement, says Interim JMEC Chairperson
As the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement approaches a crucial period, the disengagement, cantonment and unification of armed forces in the Republic of South Sudan will be a “decisive milestone”, the Interim Chairperson of the reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) has said.
In a statement delivered during the opening of the 3rdPlenary of the reconstituted JMEC in Juba on Wednesday, Ambassador Lt. Gen. Augostino Njoroge said,
“It is very important that all the armed forces of South Sudan are unified. With the rapid approach of the Transitional period, their unification will be a decisive milestone for this agreement, which is why no effort should be spared in achieving this.”
He added, “I expect that the work of the security institutions and mechanisms will quickly gather momentum, and that practical steps shall be taken to expedite the disengagement, cantonment and unification of forces.”
On mobilization of resources to support an “uninterrupted” implementation of the agreement, Ambassador Njoroge said,
“It is (for) the National Pre-transitional Committee and the incumbent Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU)to take the lead in mobilizing all requisite resources for implementation, establish effective mechanisms for disbursing funds, and support the other mechanisms of the Agreement to carry out their tasks without delay.”
“We continue our outreach to the donor community in the search for funds to support implementation, and we reiterate our heartfelt thanks for those who have already made contributions, be it financially or in–kind,” he said.

Title: Article sur le frère du président Déby: directeur de journal condamné
Print
Le directeur de publication du journal tchadien Éclairage a été condamné mercredi à six mois de prison avec sursis pour diffamation envers le frère du président Idriss Déby Itno.
Deli Nestor, directeur de publication du journal, a été condamné à six mois de prison avec sursis, 500.000 francs CFA de dommages et intérêts et 50.000 francs CFA d'amende.
La procédure contre M. Deli avait été lancée le 12 juillet 2017, après la plainte de M. Déby à la suite d'un article publié en juin et intitulé "Vilgrain, Daoussa Déby et compagnie dans la guerre du sucre".
L'article incriminait le frère du président Idriss Déby Itno, Daoussa Déby Itno, comme étant "l'un des barons de la fraude" relative à l'importation de sucre depuis le Soudan vers le Tchad.
"Mécontent de cet article, Daoussa Déby a porté plainte contre nous pour diffamation", a déclaré Deli Nestor.
"Nous avons fourni toutes les preuves de cette fraude organisée par Daoussa Déby, mais le tribunal a voulu se débarrasser des dossiers pour nous condamner", a-t-il ajouté.
Selon des médias locaux, Daoussa Déby a rejeté les accusations portées contre lui, qualifiant l'article de diffamatoire. Son avocat a aussi réclamé le remboursement des honoraires et la publication de la décision du tribunal dans trois journaux dont Éclairage.
Le Tchad était en 2018 classé 123e sur 180 dans le classement de la liberté de la presse de l'ONG Reporters sans frontières (RSF).

Title: Humanitarian Assistance in Review: East and Central Africa | Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 – 2018 - World | ReliefWeb
World+ 14 more
Conflict, rapid population growth, limited government response capacity, and a variety of natural hazards—including cyclical drought, environmental degradation, and floods—have compounded humanitarian needs over the last decade in the East and Central Africa (ECA) region.  Between FY 2009 and FY 2018, USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) provided assistance in response to a diverse range of humanitarian events, including complex emergencies in Burundi, CAR, the DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, RoC, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan; drought and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa; disease outbreaks and flooding in multiple countries; and refugee crises across the region.
Between FY 2009 and FY 2018, USAID provided more than $14.3 billion to respond to disasters in the ECA region.  USAID/OFDA assistance included more than $3.4 billion for programs in the areas of agriculture and food security; economic recovery and market systems; health; humanitarian coordination and information management; logistics support and relief commodities; nutrition; protection; shelter and settlements; and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).  USAID/FFP support included more than $10.9 billion for food and nutrition assistance through U.S. in-kind food aid; local and regional food procurement; cash transfers for food; food vouchers; specialized nutrition products; and related activities, such as asset-building programs and vocational training for vouchers. USAID responded to 97 disasters in ECA during the last decade, providing life-saving assistance to people in need.
USAID has frequently deployed humanitarian teams to the region, including five Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) responding to complex emergencies in the DRC and South Sudan; an Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the DRC; drought in Ethiopia; and a regional food security crisis in the Horn of Africa.  USAID also activated related Washington, D.C.-based Response Management Teams to support coordination and emergency response efforts in affected countries.

Title: Sudan editor detained after comment on emergency: family | Pulse Nigeria
Sudanese security agents have detained a prominent newspaper editor after he made televised comments on President Omar al-Bashir's decision to impose a state of emergency and dissolve the government, his brother said Saturday.
Osman Mirghani, editor-in-chief of independent daily Al-Tayar, was taken away by security agents from his office late on Friday, Ali Mirghani told AFP.
He said security agents detained his brother soon after his comments on Bashir's latest measures to quell weeks of protests against his three-decade-old rule.
"Soon after the president announced the emergency, my brother was speaking about it on an Arab channel," he said.
"After that he was taken away from his office. We don't know his whereabouts until now."
Agents from the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) also confiscated the entire print run of Saturday's edition of Al-Tayar, he said.
Police and security officials were unavailable for comment.
Sky News Arabia screened an interview with Mirghani on Friday evening in which he was asked whether Bashir's new measures would extinguish public anger.
He responded that they would instead "spark a new wave" of protests and send a message that the public "can exert more pressure to achieve its goal of removing this regime".
Mirghani, a US-educated engineer turned journalist, has often been targeted by security agents, who have detained him several times, confiscated copies of his newspaper or barred its publication without giving any reason.
The NISS regularly seizes entire print runs of newspapers over articles it deems inappropriate, especially those criticising the authorities or government's policies.
Sudanese authorities have launched a sweeping crackdown against protests that broke out in December, jailing protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists.
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says at least 79 journalists have been arrested since the protests erupted on December 19.
Sudan is ranked 174th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index.
Late on Friday, Bashir declared a state of emergency across the country in an attempt to quell the demonstrations.
He also dissolved the cabinet and provincial governments of all 18 provinces.
Protests erupted in Sudan after a government decision to triple the price of bread.
They swiftly escalated into anti-government demonstrations with protesters calling for Bashir to resign.
Officials say 31 people have died in protest-related violence.
Human Rights Watch says at least 51 people have been killed.
Bashir, 75, has remained defiant in the face of protests.
He swept to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.
