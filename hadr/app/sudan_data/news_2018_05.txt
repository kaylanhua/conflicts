Kiir (R) speaks with Machar during the signing ceremony of the revitalized peace agreement on 12 September 2018 (UNMISS Photo)April 2, 2019 (JUBA) – Sudan People’s Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM-IO) said the priority should be given to the formation of the unified army before to set up the transition government, and called on the IGAD and Troika country to support this call.
The slow implementation of the revitalized peace agreement due to the lack of funds has mainly impacted key steps to be implemented during the six-month pre-interim period: formation of the unified national army and to and defining the tribal boundaries.
The South Sudanese government says it has no money to achieve this costly operation which implies troops disengagement, cantonment camps and training, but the Troika countries, U.S. U.K. and Norway say Juba should finance this process from oil money and then they will consider the remaining issues.
The government’s main peace partner, the SPLM-IO, recently began to complain about the seriousness of some circles in Juba saying they do not want to establish the small joint force they agreed to set up as the nucleus unified army.
Reached to comment on these developments,  Manawa Peter Gatkuoth SPLM-IO Deputy Chairperson of the National Committee for Information and Public Relations confirmed the frustration of his movement about the implementation of the peace agreement.
“We believe that the implementation of the security arrangements is more important than the formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity of the Republic of South Sudan (RTGoNU),” he said.
He pointed out that the 700-strong presidential protection force, which the parties agreed last March to deploy in the capital, is not yet established. Also, the parties agreed to ban the presence of armed militias in the capital but obviously there is no sign for its withdrawal from Juba, he added.
“Our idea is simple we want a national army under the leadership of President Salva Kiir tasked with the protection of the state and the constitution. But there are some circles that do not want to see this happening. They are hostile to the peace process,” he said.
In a report released on 13 March, International Crisis Group  (ICG) said the SPLM-IO leader Riek Machar speaks about the need to implement the security arrangements and demarcate state boundaries first before to form the government.
“Some regional and Western officials doubt that Sudan would allow Machar to threaten the accord with such a move; others are sceptical that Machar himself would let the agreement stall,” added the think tank.
MACHAR RETURN
Manawa said Machar’s return to Juba is uncertain under the current conditions.
He added that the situation was not limited to the security arrangements but also to the lack of freedoms and the freedom of expression, human rights and basic services such as security, education, health service.
Further, he pointed out to the absence of the rule of law in South Sudan saying the state is managed with personal and tribal relations.
According to the media official, the peace implementation process requires freedoms and free media, but he regretted that there are parties that do not have “good intentions”.
“South Sudan is at a critical juncture that requiring all political leaders to raise the level of needed responsibility,” he said.
CALL FOR IGAD & TROIKA
The SPLM-IO official called on the Troika countries to support the implementation process and to follow it closely nowadays.
“The international community and the Troika consider the implementation of the peace agreement as an internal matter between the government and the signatory opposition parties. In fact, they must act to ensure its implementation”.
The Troika countries, also, have to financially support the implementation of the peace process to ensure its enforcement, added Manawa.
In the same vein, he said the IGAD countries now have turned their back on the implementation process as every country has its domestic issues.
“But they should not forget that the situation in South Sudan has a direct impact on their security and economic situation so they should move to ensure its implementation,” he stressed .

The mass arrests and detention of officers as well as ongoing prosecution of Musa Hilal and a few of his officers appear to be aimed at silencing Hilal and suppressing further confrontation between Hilal and the regime
On 21 May 2018, the case against Musa Hilal and six co-accused continued for its third hearing before a military court set up at the Military Intelligence headquarters in Khartoum. According to reliable information received, Musa Hilal and his co-accused have been charged with crimes under articles 50 (undermining the constitutional system) and 130 (murder) of the Sudanese Criminal Act, 1991, crimes that carry the death penalty.

The African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) documented the arrest and incommunicado detention of at least 290 officers from the Border Guard Forces during a Government-led campaign intended to disarm and collect firearms from civilians in Darfur, from August to December 2017. During this campaign, officers from the Rapid Support Forces arrested Mr. Musa Hilal, leader of the Border Guard Forces and former Janjaweed leader, from Misterriha in North Darfur state.
The mass arrests and detention of officers from the Border Guard Forces as well as ongoing prosecution of Musa Hilal and a few of his officers appear to be aimed at silencing Hilal and suppressing further confrontation between Hilal and the regime. It also appears that the ongoing prosecution of Hilal is in relation to violation of the disarmament campaign and will not investigate his or his troops’ involvement in atrocities in Darfur.
Hilal, a renowned leader of the Janjaweed, a Government aided militia, fought against armed groups from the African tribes during the conflict in Darfur. The Janjaweed were implicated in mass atrocities including war crimes and crimes against humanity that occurred during the conflict. Instead of disbanding the Janjaweed and holding them responsible for serious human rights violations and international crimes in Darfur, the Government incorporated the Janjaweed forces under the Sudan Armed Forces as a newly created unit called the Border Guard Forces. Hilal was made a member of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and later appointed as a Special Advisor to the Ministry of Governance. However Hilal soon grew dissatisfied with the way the regime handled his political ambitions. In 2014, Hilal set up his own political body, the Awakening (El Sahaw) Revolutionary Council, which he used to advance his political interests and control in Darfur.
Legal Framework
The disarmament campaign took place under the on-going state of emergency in force in the five states of Darfur. The legal framework for emergencies as set out in the Emergency and Protection of Public Safety Act of 1997, read together with the Emergency and Public Safety Bylaw of 1998, permits preventive arrest and detention on vague grounds. The 1998 Bylaw provides neither time limits for this type of detention, nor judicial oversight, and therefore authorises prolonged if not indefinite detention.
During his fifth visit to Sudan as an UN Independent Expert on Sudan, Mr. Aristide Nononsi noted with concern the lack of due process and fair trial standards for those detained under the Emergency Law. He called on Sudan to repeal the Emergency Laws.
The Sudan Armed Forces Act provides for military detention of an officer for up to 15 or 30 days depending on the ranks of an officer. The detention can then be renewed for up to 5 months without judicial oversight. The Act does not provide for rights of the detainee such as the right to be informed of reasons of arrest and criminal charges, the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorized by law, right to challenge lawfulness of detention; right to release pending investigation; freedom from torture and other inhuman treatment; right of habeas corpus; right to silence and freedom from self-incrimination and right to prompt access to a lawyer.
ACJPS was able to confirm the locations and dates of arrest for some of the Border Guard Forces officers however places of detention remain unknown. The arrests were carried out in various states in Darfur by the Rapid Support Forces and an arrest in Khartoum by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) of Khartoum. The continued incommunicado detention in unknown locations raises safety concerns and places the detainees at risk of torture and/or ill-treatment.
On 3 May 2018, Mr. Ali Ahmed Salim, Sudan’s State Minister for Defence made an announcement stating that Mr. Musa Hilal would be brought before a military court in Khartoum for trial on 13 May 2018. ACJPS was able to confirm that Mr. Hilal, his three sons, Mr. Hafiz Daoud, Mr. Adam Ramdan and Mr. Haroun Mahmoud Um Medikhier have been charged with articles 50 ( undermining the constitutional system) and 130 (murder) of the Sudanese Criminal Act 1991. The defence team is composed of nine lawyers led by a retired army officer holding the rank of General.
The Government of Sudan has an obligation to ensure that the military trial respects the fair trial standards enunciated in the Interim National Constitution, 2005 as well as international human rights treaties to which Sudan is a party too.
ACJPS urges the Government of Sudan:

To international and regional partners, ACJPS urges that:

Justice for Darfur atrocities
Following the incorporation of Janjaweed milias into a regular force under the Sudan Armed Forces, it became nearly impossible to have Musa Hilal or his troops tried for atrocities committed during the conflict. The Sudan Armed Forces Act, 2007 states that “no proceedings shall be taken against any officer, or soldier, who commits an act, which constitutes an offence […] thereof and he/she shall not be tried save upon permission issued by the President of the public or whoever he may authorize.” Protections afforded under this provision extend to the Border Guard Forces which operate under the command of the Sudan Armed Forces. The presence of these immunities have curtailed effective investigation and prosecutions for serious human rights violations and fostered a climate of impunity for perpetrators.
No effective justice and accountability mechanisms for serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law in conflict zones exist and government authorities continue to commit abuses with impunity. There has been no justice for the thousands of victims of the conflict in Darfur. In its August 2015 report on Darfur the Office of the High Commission on Human Rights (OHCHR) found that Sudan’s criminal justice system has failed to have a meaningful impact in combatting impunity and strengthening accountability in that region.
The Government of Sudan has an obligation to ensure that those suspected of being responsible for serious human rights violations and international crimes in Darfur, are investigated and prosecuted without delay before independent and impartial courts. ACJPS urges the Government of Sudan:

Background
The Border Guard Forces, formerly part of the Janjaweed militias that were responsible for a number of atrocities during the conflict in Darfur, were incorporated into the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and granted military status. As a unit under the SAF, they are entitled to immunities against prosecution in accordance with section 34 of the Sudan Armed Forces Act 2007. Lifting of these immunities would require permission from the President or a duly authorized representative.
On 8 August 2017, Mr. Hassabo Mohamed Abdulrahman, the Vice President announced the issuance of Presidential Decree No 419/2017 that authorized the collection of illegal weapons and legalization of cars crossing into Sudan from neighboring countries. The decree called for the collection of weapons from civilians and ill-regular forces but exempted the Rapid Support Forces, another paramilitary forces that was formerly part of the Janjaweed militias and later incorporated as a regular force under the NISS and later under the command of SAF.
In response to the announcement of the weapon collection exercise, a representative from Mr. Hilal’s team made a statement rejecting the exercise, stating that the campaign was specifically targeted at Musa Hilal and his followers. It is reported that Musa Hilal was gaining more authority and becoming more independent from the Central Government making it difficult to control him and his troops. It is also reported that he had gained extensive control of the gold-rich Jebel Marra area making it even more difficult regulate gold mining activities. There were talks about integrating the Border Guard Forces into the Rapid Support Forces but this move was rejected by Musa Hilal and his group.

Sudan’s head of military transition council  Awad Ibn Ouf  (Photo SUNA)April 11, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese Defense Minister First Vice- President Awad Ibn Ouf overthrew President Omer al-Bashir and announced his arrest in a safe place.
On Thursday afternoon, Ibn Ouf read a military statement on behalf of the Supreme Security Committee, which includes the armed forces, the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the police.
He said the Committee “decided to carry out what was not expected by the head of the regime and took full responsibility for changing the whole regime during a two-year transitional period,” he said before to add that “the armed forces – with a limited representation of the components of that committee – will take is the responsibility of the state administration.
“I, the Minister of Defense, the head of the Supreme Security Committee, announces the uprooting of the regime and the arrest of its head in a safe place.”
He explained that the Security Committee has been since the 6 April considering the alternatives and warned of the seriousness of the situation but they were faced by the Stubbornness and insistence on security solutions, without naming al-Bashir.
He added they had been convinced of the impossibility to implement such an option, pointing out that it would have caused significant losses.
Ibn Ouf made his speech after a long delay as it was announced since the early morning.
It came in a bid to end the over four-month protests demanding al-Bashir and his regime to step down.
Ibn Ouf further announced a number of measures including the formation of a Transitional Military Council to rule the country for a two-year transitional period.
The details of this government will be disclosed in a later statement, he said.
Also, he decided to suspend the Interim Constitution of 2005 and announced a three-month state of emergency and a one-month of curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
He further decided the closure of the airspace for twenty-four hours.
Furthermore, he dissolved the government, the parliament and the presidential cabinet as well as the state governments and legislatures.
Ibn Ouf maintained the unilateral cease-fire throughout Sudan and announced the immediate release of all political prisoners, the creation of a conducive climate for the peaceful transfer of power, the building of political parties, the holding of free and fair elections at the end of the transitional period and the establishment of a permanent constitution.

Title: Darfur security committees to re-enforce arms collection - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The national committee for the collection of weapons and vehicle registration held a meeting with all security committees from the five states of Darfur in Nierteti.
The national committee for the collection of weapons and vehicle registration held a meeting with all security committees from the five states of Darfur in Nierteti.
The national committee, led by Sudan’s Second Vice-President Hasabo Mohamed Abdelrahman, informed the press after the meeting that the goal was to re-mobilise all forces and “harness the possibilities to supplement the national campaign to collect weapons”.
Nearly one year ago, Khartoum announced alarge disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone, more than12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.
Now, the vice-president has threatened those who do not collaborate in the process of collection illegal weapons of serious consequences they will face. “There are punishments awaiting some of them to the extent of life imprisonment and execution.
“We are serious in this control and restrict weapons only to the regular forces. They themselves are bound by regulations for carrying weapons.”
Abdelrahman called on the leaders of the legislative councils in Darfur to conduct a campaign to raise awareness in their villages about the consequences for those who keep their illegal weapons, and the seriousness of Khartoum in the protection of villages for voluntary returnees.
Compulsory arms collection
At the end of October, the window for the voluntary handover of weapons ended and compulsory collection began. Darfuri government officials reported that about 30,000 weapons were collected during the voluntary phase. The number of illegal weapons in the region, however. is estimated at about 700,000 pieces.
People in Darfur haverepeatedly reportedthat soldiers of the RSF used violence while carrying out the collection campaign of illegal weapons in the region. In November, following a ‘show of force’ in Kalma camp for displaced people, the hybrid peacekeeping mission Unamid called on the Sudanese authorities tocoordinate the search of illegal weaponsin the Darfur camps for the displaced with the UN-AU peacekeepers.

Title: Attaques meurtrières contre trois camps de déplacés au Darfour
Print
Plusieurs civils ont été tués et blessés dans des attaques contre trois camps de déplacés au Darfour cette semaine, a indiqué jeudi la force de maintien de la paix de l'ONU dans cette région de l'ouest du Soudan en proie aux violences.
La force conjointe de maintien de la paix de l'ONU et de l'Union africaine (Minuad), qui n'a pas donné de bilan précis, a rapporté que les camps de Khamsa Dagaig, Ardayba et Jedda abritant des milliers de déplacés dans l'Etat du Darfour-Centre avaient été attaqués entre le 21 et 23 mai.
Des déplacés ont accusé des membres des Forces de soutien rapide (RSF), une milice proche du gouvernement soudanais, d'avoir commis ces attaques.

Une femme a été tuée le 21 mai dans l'attaque du camp de Khamsa Dagaig, située dans la ville de Zalingei, capitale de l'Etat du Darfour-Centre, par des membres des RSF à bord de pick-ups équipés de mitrailleuses, a rapporté Amnesty International.
Selon les autorités locales, l'incident est le fruit d'une "erreur".
Des déplacés d'Ardayba ont raconté que leur camp avait été attaqué par des hommes des RSF mardi soir et de nouveau mercredi, entraînant des affrontements entre la milice et des déplacés.
Aucune information n'était pour l'heure disponible sur l'attaque du camp de Jedda et les autorités du Darfour-Centre étaient injoignables.
La Minuad a elle assuré que "les attaques" dans ces trois camps avaient fait des morts et des blessés parmi les déplacés.

"La mission rappelle à toutes les parties impliquées que les camps de déplacés sont considérés comme un espace humanitaire où il devrait n'y avoir aucune arme et où les déplacés ne doivent pas être la cible de menaces, d'harcèlement et d'attaques", a affirmé la mission conjointe dans un communiqué.
Khartoum considère que la guerre au Darfour, qui a fait plus de 300.000 morts et 2,5 millions de déplacés depuis 2003 selon l'ONU, est aujourd'hui terminée mais des violences ont toujours ponctuellement lieu dans cette région de l'ouest du Soudan.
Les RSF sont officiellement sous le contrôle de l'armée soudanaise, mais sont essentiellement composées de milices arabes ayant combattu aux côtés des forces gouvernementales dans les premières années de la guerre au Darfour.

Title: Ongoing clashes between RSF, rebels in Darfur’s Jebel Marra - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The rebel Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) claimed to have killed 14 Sudanese paramilitary troops when they repelled two attacks in Darfur’s Jebel Marra.
The rebel Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) claimed to have killed 14 Sudanese paramilitary troops when they repelled two attacks in Darfur’s Jebel Marra.
The attacks on Thursday resulted in the death of 14 members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and wounding 28 others, the armed movement claimed. Waleed Mohamed Abakar, the military spokesman told Radio Dabanga that the RSF attack took place in the area of Kobo in southern Jebel Marra. “We fought back and forced the troops to retreat to Kara and Kass.”
He added that the rebels also repelled an attack in Turti and Nugud in western Jebel Marra.
Three civilians were reportedly wounded as the pro-government troops shelled Saboun El Fagur on Thursday. Fighting then continued in the areas of Saboun El Fagur, Kobo, Kuru, Jarku and Kor in Jebel Marra.
Earlier this week fierce battles raged between the rebels and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in Kobo, where again, the SLM-AW claimed to have repulsed the attacks on its bases. TheSudanese Air Force bombed areas in Jebel Marra on Tuesday, according to the movement.
Growing displacement
Responding to the renewed clashes, the Darfur Displaced and Refugees Association reported that a large number of residents in Jebel Marra villages have been affected by the clashes and fled their homes.
Spokesman Hussein Abushrati told Radio Dabanga that a large number of residents has been displaced by the recent fighting. “The association calls upon Unamid to go to Jebel Marra and investigate the deteriorating humanitarian conditions, and the lack of basic commodities – for which the government is responsible.”
On Saturday the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Mission in Darfur (Unamid) Joint Special Representative (JSR) Jeremiah Mamabolo expressed his concerns about the recent clashes between Sudanese government forces and SLM-AW fighters in Jebel Marra.
“We particularly regret the new displacements and the burning of villages such as Gobbo, Kawara, Kimingtong in South Darfur as well as other villages in the Rokoro locality in Central Darfur,” he added in his briefing to the press.
Military offensive
This year inMarch, government forces, consisting mainly of paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, attacked rebel sites in East Jebel Marra in South Darfur. In April, areas in north-western Jebel Marra were targeted. At least13 villagesburned to the ground.Tens of thousands of peoplereportedly fled their homes. TheUS Department of Stateexpressed its serious concerns about the renewed violence. This month, againthousands of villagerswere newly displaced by fighting in the southern part of Jebel Marra in Kass in South Darfur.
According to the UN and partners, 82,000 people were newly displaced across Darfur during the first seven months of 2016, when a similar military offensive against the holdout rebels in the mountainous region shook its grounds. Up to an additional 117,000 people were also reportedly displaced, but the UN and partners were unable to verify these figures owing to a lack of access to the relevant locations.

A faction of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North (SPLA-N) led by Gen. Malik Agar said it has repulsed attacks by government forces in Blue Nile.
Mubarak Ardol, spokesman of the rebel group led by Agar, told Radio Tamazuj on Tuesday that their positions came under attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) in Sulta and Angesina areas last week.
He pointed out that the attacks resulted in the wounded of four soldiers from their side, while claiming that eight government forces including high ranking officers were killed.
Ardol further said dozens of civilians fled their homes following fighting between the two forces.
Sudanese military officials could not immediately be reached for comment.



Title: Une femme tuée dans une "attaque" contre un camp de déplacés au Darfour
Print
Une femme a été tuée dans une "attaque" menée par une milice proche du gouvernement soudanais contre un camp de déplacés au Darfour, a indiqué mardi Amnesty International, les autorités assurant qu'elle avait été blessée par balles lors de heurts.
Khartoum considère que la guerre au Darfour, qui a fait plus de 300.000 morts et 2,5 millions de déplacés depuis 2003 selon l'ONU, est aujourd'hui terminée mais des violences ont toujours ponctuellement lieu dans cette région de l'ouest du Soudan.
Selon Amnesty, des membres des Forces de soutien rapide (RSF) se trouvant à bord de cinq pick-ups équipés de mitrailleuses ont attaqué lundi un camp de déplacés dans la ville de Zalingei, capitale de l'Etat du Darfour-Centre.

"Une femme de 22 ans a été touchée par balles à la tête et est décédée à l'hôpital", a indiqué dans un communiqué l'ONG, affirmant que la raison des tirs était floue. Dix autres personnes, dont des enfants, ont été blessées, selon Amnesty.

Selon les autorités locales, l'incident est le fruit d'une "erreur".
"Six véhicules des RSF qui allaient du Darfour-Sud au Darfour-Ouest sont entrés par erreur dans un camp de déplacés", ont-elles indiqué dans un communiqué. "Les déplacés ont affronté les RSF, qui ont tiré en l'air et une femme a alors été grièvement blessée".
Des résidents du camp ont ensuite manifesté leur colère devant un bâtiment du gouvernorat et des heurts ont eu lieu avec les forces de sécurité, faisant neuf blessés chez les civils et cinq chez les soldats, d'après les autorités du Darfour-Centre.
Amnesty a confirmé qu'une manifestation avait eu lieu et précisé que 7 personnes avaient été arrêtées.
L'ONG a demandé que les autorités mènent une enquête "prompte, exhaustive et impartiale" après cette "attaque brutale" dans un camp qui "est supposé être un lieu sûr".

L'insurrection au Darfour a débuté il y a quinze ans lorsque des rebelles de minorité ethnique, s'estimant marginalisés, ont contesté par les armes le pouvoir central de Khartoum, dominé par les Arabes.
Aujourd'hui, le niveau de violence a globalement baissé, la force de maintien de la paix de l'ONU et de l'Union africaine (Minuad) a réduit ses effectifs et Khartoum menace de fermer les camps de déplacés.
Mais Amnesty International assure que les violences continuent en nombre dans cette région à laquelle les médias internationaux n'ont pas accès.

L'ONG affirme ainsi avoir recueilli des preuves concernant 244 actes de violence entre août 2017 et avril 2018, spécialement dans le Darfour-Nord et la zone du Djebel Marra.
Le conflit au Darfour vaut au président Omar el-Béchir d'être recherché par la Cour pénale internationale pour répondre d'accusations de crimes de guerre et crimes contre l'humanité.

Title: Sudan V-P: No compensation for those who surrender arms - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Second Vice-President Hasabo Abdelrahman has said that the current disarmament campaign is being carried out without giving any compensation to those who surrender their weapons.
Second Vice-President Hasabo Abdelrahman has said that the current disarmament campaign is being carried out without giving any compensation to those who surrender their weapons.
He said that the reason for this is that the compensation costs large sums, stimulates the arms traffickers, and encourages the trade and flow of weapons from outside the borders of Sudan.
Yesterday in his orientation to the Council of States, Abdelrahman stressed that “the campaign in six months has achieved the imposition of prestige of the state, the rule of law, the low rates of committed crimes, the disappearance of the phenomenon of carrying weapons in the states of Darfur, as well as the disappearance of tribal conflict and low rates of looting and thefts using weapons, safety and tranquillity and the high rates of voluntary return of refugees and displaced people”.
Abdelrahman announced that any vehicle that is not registered by May 14 will be confiscated.
The national committee for the collection of weapons and vehicle registration held a meeting with all security committees from the five states of Darfur in Nierteti.
The national committee, led by Abdelrahman, informed the press after the meeting earlier this week that the goal was to re-mobilise all forces and “harness the possibilities to supplement the national campaign to collect weapons”.
Nearly one year ago, Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone,more than 12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.
Now, the vice-president has threatened those who do not collaborate in the process of collection illegal weapons of serious consequences they will face. “There are punishments awaiting some of them to the extent of life imprisonment and execution.”

♦Financial woes fell Sudan's Hurriyat online newspaper
April 29 – 2018 KAMPALAA financial crisis and resolute refusal to compromise on independence has forced the independent daily electronic newspaperHurriyatto cease publication from Thursday.
“While some proposals were put forward for the continuation of the newspaper, the majority of theHurriyatfamily felt that these proposals may not guarantee the independence of the newspaper and its democratic line of contention,”Hurriyatsaid in a statement on Thursday.
The dailyHurriyat, meaning ‘freedom’, was launched in 2010 by journalist El Haj Warrag. It was one of the most prominent independent Sudanese democratic newspapers. The platform focused on the rights of the Sudanese, combating human rights violations, corruption and obscurantism.
In response the Sudan Democracy First Group (SDFG) considers the withdrawal of donors the result of the international community’s ‘new strategy’ to support the Sudanese government. Sudanese civil and political circles were shocked by the news ofHurriyatto stop publishing, theSDFG stated. It pointed as well to recent suspension of Afiyat Darfur Radio for the same reason, and the “dwindling of support from donors” for Radio Dabanga. The international community is currently supporting the consolidation of the status quo in Sudan – “which requires the suspension of all resources and funds available to opponents of the de facto government in Khartoum”.

Title: Darfur militia leader Hilal’s military trial begins - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The military trial of Musa Hilal, former janjaweed leader and chairman of the Revolutionary Awakening Council, secretly began in court on Monday. The hearing has been adjourned to May 13.
The military trial of Musa Hilal,former janjaweed leader and chairman of theRevolutionary Awakening Council, secretly began in court on Monday. The hearing has been adjourned to May 13.
State Minister at the Ministry of Defence Ali Mohamed Salim said that the trial “continues in the sense that Hilal belongs to the military forces”. In the press statement Salim said that Hilal had requested the use of lawyers to defend him.
In November 2017, Sheikh Musa Hilalwas arrested during an ambush in the Mesteriya area, along with his sons, brothers, and entourage, by elements of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia and was subsequently transferred to Khartoum.Hilal refused to cooperate with the government’s campaign of disarmament and arms collection.
The Revolutionary Awakening Council has threatened that the military trial of Sheikh Musa Hilal and detention of his sons and companions is “a step to ignite the great strife whose consequences and complications will occur in unpredictable terms”.
The council issued a statement this week saying that the arrest of Hilal, his sons and his affiliates was accompanied by the arrest of more than 2,000 people from Darfur.
In July last year, Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan. At the end of October, the window for the voluntary handover of weapons ended and compulsory collection began. Darfuri government officials reported that about 30,000 weapons were collected during the voluntary phase. The number of illegal weapons in the region, however, is estimated at about 700,000 pieces.
Revolutionary Awakening Council
The RAC is an association of Hilal’s combatants and native administration leaders in North Darfur. Its military commanders have taken control of the Jebel ‘Amer gold mining area in El Sareif Beni Hussein locality. According to a UN Security Council reportin April 2016, Hilal is profiting from vast gold sales in Darfur.

Title: Sudan: Pro-government militia open deadly fire on IDP camp in Central Darfur - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
Amnesty International has called for an immediate investigation into a deadly attack by a pro-government militia on an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Central Darfur, in which one woman was shot dead and at least 10 people injured.
On 21 May, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a pro-government militia, on board of five pick-up trucks and armed with machine guns, attacked the IDP camp in the city of Zalingei. A 22-year-old woman was shot in the head and later died in hospital. Ten others, including children, sustained serious head, neck, arm and leg injuries. The reasons for the attack remain unclear.
“The victims of this appalling attack were forced to flee from their homes by the violence that has plagued Darfur for years, and this camp was supposed to be a place of safety. Unless the perpetrators of gross human rights violations like this are brought to justice, the voluntary and safe return to home of Darfur’s displaced will remain a distant prospect,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa.
“We are calling on the Sudanese authorities to conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into this brutal attack, and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice in fair trials. All parties to the conflict in Darfur must stop attacks against civilians and ensure respect of human rights and international humanitarian law.”
According to information collected by Amnesty International, following yesterday’s attack, protesters gathered in front of the state government building, the hospital and the market in Zalingei to denounce the use of excessive force. The security forces arrested seven people including Abdel Karim Abdalla, a 26-year-old student activist.
Amnesty International has closely monitored the conflict in Darfur since its eruption more than 15 years ago. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese remain displaced and face dire humanitarian conditions and serious human rights violations.
Amnesty International has received credible information and evidence that between August 2017 and April 2018, incidents of unlawful killings, rape, abduction, looting of villages and livestock, and torching of homes and arbitrary detention continue in Darfur.
Amnesty International recorded 244 incidents of unlawful killings in different parts of Darfur, allegedly committed by pro-government militias from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 75 percent of the incidents that led to loss of lives took place in North Darfur and Jebel Marra area.
Amnesty International has also received reports of sexual violence and prior research indicates that the pro-government militias, especially the RSF, are implicated in most of these violations.

Title: Militia shooting in Central Darfur camp leaves one dead - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Sudanese militiamen killed a displaced woman and wounded ten other people near a camp in Zalingei, Central Darfur, on Monday.
Sudanese militiamen killed a displaced woman and wounded ten other people near a camp in Zalingei, Central Darfur, on Monday.
The coordinator of the Central Darfur camps, El Shafee Abdallah, informed Radio Dabanga about the incident in Khamsa Degaig camp. “A force of the paramility Rapid Support Forces stormed the camp at 9am. They were driving vehicles with Dushka machine guns mounted on the top.”
The attackers opened fire into the air. The hail of bullets instantly killed 22-year-old Magboula Hasabelnabi and wounded her child of 17 months old, Anas Adam, the camp coordinator reported. The mother’s body has been brought to the hospital.
Her death has led to demonstrations in the camp. “Demonstrators faced a police and security force, which led to the eruption of another demonstration in Zalingei,” Abdallah said.
Zalingei protest
“The demonstrators went to the secretariat of the government of Central Darfur state in protest against what happened. Again, the protesters faced live ammunition by the police.”
Several people were wounded including Abdelaziz Musa Eisa, Rashid Mohamed Hamid, Hawa El Tahir Musa and Izeldin Sharafeldin.

Abdallah further reported that members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) exchanged fire with the military police in the area following the events. Three military troops sustained injury and transferred to the military hospital, he said.
“The RSF members lost their way in Khamsa Degaig camp.” – Zalingei commissioner
Zalingei locality commissioner Khalid Bilal Ahmed reported another account of what took place in the camp. The clash took place over friction between camp residents and RSF members who were on their way to El Geneina aboard six vehicles. They “lost their way” in the camp, the commissioner said in a press statement.
Camp residents did not welcome the paramilitary force which prompted some of the visitors to open fire into the air, Khalid Bilal said. His account of the event continues with the protest in front of the state government’s secretariat.
The commissioner said that clashes between residents and military troops caused the injury of five troops and nine protesting residents of Khamsa Degaig. Three of them have been transferred to El Geneina hospital; the remaining were taken to Zalingei hospital.
Khalid Bilal announced the formation of a committee to investigate events and prevent similar incidents.
Condemnation
The Darfur Displaced and Refugees Association has condemned the storming of Khamsa Degaig camp, causing death of Hasabelnabi. Spokesman Hussein Abusharati told Radio Dabanga that his association holds the RSF members responsible for the incidents.
“The perpetrators should be immediately prosecuted while retaining the relatives’ right to retribution. The wounded have to be treated and compensated as well.”
The Darfur Bar Association (DBA) also condemned the “brutal aggression by the regime’s militia on the displaced in the camp”.
Yesterday the DBA issued a statement following the attack. The lawyers called on the international community, the United Nations in particular, to force the Sudanese government to respect the rights of displaced people according to the provisions of the Sudanese constitution and law.

Halayeb Triangle (Sudan-Egypt) Borders, on 22 October 2012 (NASA-Google)March 21, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese foreign ministry Thursday summoned the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum to protest a call by his government for bids on oil and gas exploration in the disputed border area of Halayeb.
The move comes 12 days after an announcement by the Egyptian state-owned South Valley Egyptian Petroleum Holding Company calling for 10 oil and gas exploration blocks in the “Egyptian territorial waters in the Red Sea”
The foreign ministry said that Egyptian Ambassador Hussam Issa received a letter of protest calling to stop the international tender for exploration of oil and gas in “Red Sea areas that are under Sudanese sovereignty”.
“The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Badr al-Din Abdallah expressed, to the Egyptian ambassador, the Sudanese protest against this announcement, calling for stopping this measure, which contradicts the legal status of the Halaib triangle and  does not correspond to the steps taken by the brotherly countries to find a joint strategic partnership,” emphasized the statement.
In January 2019, the two countries agreed to enhance bilateral relations after boosting security cooperation during the past year.
The Halayeb triangle, which is a 20,580 km area on the Red Sea, has been a contentious issue between Egypt and Sudan since 1958, shortly after Sudan gained its independence from the British-Egyptian rule in January 1956.
The area has been under Cairo’s full military control since the mid-1990s following a Sudanese-backed attempt to kill the former Egyptian President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak.
Sudan has been notifying the UN Security Council on this issue annually since 1958  to renew its rejection of the “Egyptian military occupation of Sudan’s Halayeb triangle and maritime borders”.
Cairo refuses demands by the Sudanese government to hold direct talks on Halayeb and Shalateen or to accept the referral of the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration.

Title: Thousands newly displaced by Jebel Marra fighting - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Thousands of civilians have reportedly been newly displaced from villages in southern Jebel Marra as fighting broke out between government forces, allied militias and armed rebels in the area of Kass on Friday.
Thousands of civilians have reportedly been newly displaced from villages in southern Jebel Marra as fighting broke out between government forces, allied militias and armed rebels in the area of Kass on Friday.
Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that the fighting in the Jebel Marra mountains in South Darfur has pushed “thousands of civilians to flee to Kara, Kabu, Kor, Saboun El Fagur, Girlanjabang, Waglem, Karoo, Wrangla and Daruna”.
Their numbers add to the reported 11,500 displaced people who have fled from the fighting in northern Jebel Marra at the end of April. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) at least 2,280 newly displaced households (about 11,500 people) arrived in Rokoro town and nearby Jemeiza village after 18 April.
People in Kass have described the situation to Radio Dabanga as “very difficult”. They recounted that the Sudanese army had mobilised more than 1,500 troops and Rapid Support Forces [RSF], backed by other troops that arrived from Zalingei in an attempt to launch new attacks on the holdout armed Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) in Jebel Marra.
People fleeing from Gobo village told Radio Dabanga last week that two people were killed and four others were wounded in the clashes in southern Jebel Marra on Friday. People from neighbouring Sina village said that they heard shooting and explosions until Friday afternoon. Smoke was seen billowing above the areas of Tara, Tarantara, and Kalokitting.
In the past years, government forces have made various attempts to eliminate SLM-AW bases in the Jebel Marra region during the dry seasons (roughly between January-and May). In 2016,more than 80,000 peoplewere displaced by a major military offensive against the holdout rebels in the area.
This year inMarch, government forces, consisting mainly of RSF troops, attacked rebel sites in East Jebel Marra. The next month, areas in north-western Jebel Marra were targeted. At least13 villagesburned to the ground.Tens of thousands of peoplefled their homes.
Today, Sudan’s minister of defence is expected to appear before parliament to respond to the issue. Member of Parliament Siham Hassan Hasaballah requested his comments on the violent events in Rokoro, Deribat, Nierteti and Tur. Hasaballah has been known to represent the SLM-AW.
UN humanitarian chief
At the end of a three-day mission to Sudan, United Nations humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has made several urgent requests to Sudan and the international community, including to allow access to conflict-ridden areas for humanitarian organisations.
In a statement to the press on Monday, Under-Secretary-General Lowcock said that “skirmishes in recent weeks between armed groups in pockets of Darfur’s Jebel Marra region have caused a renewed wave of internal displacement”. Heurged all parties to the conflictin Sudan to allow the humanitarian community to bring assistance to people in need.
According to the UN, unilateral ceasefires which the warring parties recently announced, have improved the security situation across Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.
Recent attempts to join two of the main holdout armed movements and the Sudanese government in a pre-negotiation deal about a cessation of hostilities in Darfur,failed in Berlinin April. In February, the African Union alsosuspended peace talksbetween Khartoum and the SPLM-N led by Abdelaziz El Hilu regarding South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

♦Militia shooting in Central Darfur camp leaves one dead
May 22 – 2018 ZALINGEISudanese militiamen killed a displaced woman and wounded ten other people near a camp in Zalingei, Central Darfur, on Monday. The coordinator of the Central Darfur camps, El Shafee Abdallah, informed Radio Dabanga about the incident in Khamsa Degaig camp. “A force of the paramility Rapid Support Forces stormed the camp at 9am. They were driving vehicles with Dushka machine guns mounted on the top.”
The attackers opened fire into the air. The hail of bullets instantly killed 22-year-old Magboula Hasabelnabi and wounded her child of 17 months old. Her death has led to demonstrations in the camp and in Zalingei town against the state authorities, where protesters faced police who fired live ammunition at them, according to El Shafee.
Zalingei locality commissioner Khalid Bilal Ahmed reported another account of what took place in the camp. The clash took place over friction between camp residents and RSF members who were on their way to El Geneina aboard six vehicles. They “lost their way” in the camp, where camp residents did not welcome them.

♦Fraud probe: UNHCR suspends resettlement programme from Sudan
May 17 – 2018KHARTOUMThe UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), is temporarily suspending its refugee resettlement programme from Sudan in connection with two ongoing investigations launched in February and March by the organisation’s independent Inspector General’s Office. A separate anti-fraud and integrity support mission is expected to deploy shortly, according to a statement by the UNHCR from Khartoum on May 17.
“At present we are still dealing with allegations, based on reports that have come from refugees. Nonetheless these are worrying and the integrity of the Sudan resettlement programme has to be assured beyond any doubt,” said UNHCR Representative for Sudan Noriko Yoshida. “Should wrongdoing be confirmed, those responsible can expect the consequences to be severe.”
In itspress statement, the agency underlined that the UNHCR never charges fees to help refugees or others under its duty of care. Resettlement is one of thethree main solutionsoffered to refugees and applies to vulnerable people for whom there is no possibility of either voluntary return or local integration. As such, it is a vital lifeline.

Title: South Darfur Wali: ‘Arms collection helped return 65,000 displaced families' - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Wali of South Darfur, Adam El Faki, claims that the campaign of arms collection in the state helped bring more than 65,000 families back to their villages.
The Wali of South Darfur, Adam El Faki, claims that the campaign of arms collection in the state helped bring more than 65,000 families back to their villages.
At a meeting in Khartoum with the Second Vice-President of the Republic, Hasabo Abdelrahman on Tuesday, El Faki said that work is underway to resettle the returnees in their villages and provide them with the necessary services.
El Faki pointed to the beginning of the second phase by planning more than 20,000 pieces of land to accommodate the displaced who are unwilling to return to their villages, to be followed by the third phase of planning the camps and then ending the effects of the war in South Darfur.
Arms collection
Nearly one year ago, Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone,more than 12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.
Now, the vice-president has threatened those who do not collaborate in the process of collection illegal weapons of serious consequences they will face. “There are punishments awaiting some of them to the extent of life imprisonment and execution.”
Return
In April Governor El Faki declared that Kalma camp would be dismantled by force and evacuated within a couple of weeks, as part of President Omar Al Bashir’s voluntary repatriation plan that would result in an end to the presence of camps in the state.
Kalma is with more than 100,000 displaced one of the largest camps for the displaced in the region. According to El Faki, there are 14 camps in South Darfur that hold 528,000 people.
He went as far as threatening that the state hadprepared cells in a prisonin Red Sea State, where they could receive detainees who stand against voluntary return, from South Darfur.
Insecurity
Voluntary return is one of the options which the Sudanese government gives to the people in Darfur who have been displaced by the armed conflict that erupted in 2003. Khartoum plans to transform thecamps into residential areas, or integrate them into existing towns.
The people in the camps point tothe insecuritythat is still plaguing villagersin most parts of Darfur, despite the large yet partly successful disarmament campaign ordered by the Sudanese presidency last year. They say that it is often caused by roaming militiamen and the abundance of weapons –that have not been found and collected during the government’s disarmament campaign last year– as well as the danger of running intoarmed new settlersin the home areas.
Sheikh Abdelrazig Yousef, spokesman for the Darfur Displaced General Coordination told Radio Dabangain March this yearthat the displaced consider the current voluntary return projects initiated by the government as “intimidation.
“They want the people living in the camps to forcibly return to their villages so as to obliterate the marks of displacement,” he said.

April 6, 2019  (KHARTOUM) – Thousands of Sudanese staged protests in front of the General Command of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) demanding the removal of the regime of President Omer al-Bashir.
Last week, the opposition forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change (DFC) called on the Sudanese to join the April 6 rally heading to the SAF command to demand that the army side with the protesters.
Since the early hours of Saturday, Sudanese authorities sealed off the bridges leading to the capital to prevent protesters from joining the rally. However, thousands managed to break the siege and poured into the streets of downtown Khartoum and managed to arrive at the SAF command.
Security forces and police fired teargas to disperse protesters who gathered in front of the SAF command but army officers reportedly intervened to stop the police action.
Also, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets at a number of states including Kassala, Port Sudan, Gezira, River Nile, West and South Darfur.
Following the rally, DFC issued a statement declaring an open-ended sit-in in front of the SAF command and called on all Sudanese to join .
This is the longest streak of protests in the history of Sudan which now entered its 4th month.
Last February, President Omer al-Bashir declared a state of emergency in a bid to end it but the demonstrations have continued unabated.
