CAIRO - Officials in Sudan said on Saturday an attack by Yemeni rebels killed six members of a Sudanese paramilitary force that’s been fighting in Yemen.
Iran-backed Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition that includes the Sudanese forces have fought Yemen’s civil war to a stalemate. The United Arab Emirates and Sudan have been pulling out troops in recent months, though they say they aren’t quitting the Saudi-led alliance.
The officials said that the attack earlier this week targeted a position on the Saudi-Yemen border held by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or the RSF.
Gen. Mohammed Hamadan Dagalo leads the RSF, which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias used by former autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s.
In past years Dagalo, who is a Saudi ally, mobilized thousands of RSF troops to fight in Yemen on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the backbone of the military coalition.The coalition was formed in 2015 to stem the advance of the Houthi rebels following their 2014 takeover of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa and the northern provinces, pushing out the internationally recognized government.The Sudanese troops had deployed mainly to Yemen’s border areas with Saudi Arabia to repel any attacks by Houthis on the kingdom.The officials said the Sudanese troops were patrolling the frontier area on Wednesday when they were attacked by the Houthis. At least three others were wounded in the attack.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates had said an attack on the Saudi-Yemen border killed one of its soldiers. But it’s unclear if the Sudanese troops were killed in the same attack which took place in Saudi Arabia’s Najran region.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not answer calls seeking comment.The war in Yemen has claimed over 100,000 of lives, thrust millions to the brink of famine and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

The coalition was formed in 2015 to stem the advance of the Houthi rebels following their 2014 takeover of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa and the northern provinces, pushing out the internationally recognized government.
The Sudanese troops had deployed mainly to Yemen’s border areas with Saudi Arabia to repel any attacks by Houthis on the kingdom.
The officials said the Sudanese troops were patrolling the frontier area on Wednesday when they were attacked by the Houthis. At least three others were wounded in the attack.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.
On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates had said an attack on the Saudi-Yemen border killed one of its soldiers. But it’s unclear if the Sudanese troops were killed in the same attack which took place in Saudi Arabia’s Najran region.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not answer calls seeking comment.

Title: Protest rally for release of janjaweed leader detained in Sudan - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Revolutionary Awakening Council (RAC), led by former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal, currently detained in Khartoum, welcomed calls of activists and relatives of detainees for a protest rally on Tuesday.
The Revolutionary Awakening Council (RAC), led by former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal, currently detained in Khartoum, has welcomed calls of activists and relatives of detainees for a protest rally on Tuesday.
On November 26, Hilal and other members of the RAC will have been in prison forexactly two years.
In a statement on Sunday, the council's spokesman Ahmed Abakar called on the Sovereign Council, the cabinet, the chief justice, and the attorney general, to release not only the founder and head of the RAC and his comrades immediately, but all members of the armed movements detained in Sudan.
The statement warned against the consequences of excessive use and abuse of power by the state against political opponents.
The RAC called on the Sovereign Council and Cabinet to intervene urgently to put an end to these practices. It claims to work hard to resolve the roots of the crisis in Darfur and give priority to creating an appropriate climate to achieve a comprehensive and just peace.
Saraf Omra
The council further reported that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s largest militia that supported the former regime, surrounded the market of Kurgul in Saraf Omra locality in North Darfur with more than 100 vehicles on Saturday.
The militia troops shot at the people and beat them with whips and sticks, which led to the death of Sanousi Maala, a cousin of RAC Secretary Mohamed Khaddam.
The RAC condemned the incident and called upon the attorney general, Unamid, and international and local organisations to investigate the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice immediately.
The statement also called for the removal of the RSF militiamen from all these localities and area and replacing them with civilian police.
Detained
Hilal was held, together with a number of his relatives and followers, ina raid on his stronghold in Misteriya, North Darfur, in November 2017, after he refused to respond tothe government’s disarmament campaign. He was immediately transferred to a prison in Khartoum.His trial secretly began on April 30, 2018.
Hilal is held responsible for numerous atrocities committed in Darfur against civilians after the conflict erupted in 2003. In that year, he was released from prison by the Sudanese government with the purpose to mobilise Darfuri Arab herders to fight the insurgency in the region.
With full government backing, his militiamen, popularly called janjaweed, targeted villages of African Darfuris. They rarely came near forces of the armed rebel movements.
In 2008, the militia leader was appointed as Presidential Assistant for Federal Affairs. In January 2014 however, he announced his defection from the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), returned to Darfur and established the RAC.
The RAC consists of Hilal’s militiamen and a number of North Darfur native administration leaders.RAC commanders took control of the Jebel Amer gold mining areain El Sareif Beni Hussein locality in July 2015. According to a UN Security Council reportin April 2016, Hilal and his entourage were profiting from vast gold sales in Darfur.

EL FASHER, Sudan, November 6 (Reuters):Saleha Nour sits selling nuts in the market in El Fasher, Darfur and dismisses her new prime minister's promise of a brighter new future with a wave of her hand.

She is talking on the eve of a visit by the premier - Abdalla Hamdok - who is coming to set out his plans to settle the near 17-year-old conflict in the west Sudanese region and repair the damage done by ousted president Omar al-Bashir.

But Nour has heard all the promises before and long given up hope of returning to the village she was forced to flee at the start of the fighting.

Violence may have subsided since the days when Bashir mobilised mostly Arab militia to crush an uprising by mostly non-Arab rebels, unleashing a wave of killings and mass displacement that Washington and others called genocide.

But it is still too dangerous for families to go back and for things to return to how they were, says Nour.

"When some ... went (back) farming they got attacked at night in their houses and killed," Nour says. She now lives in a camp outside El Fasher. Other families lost their cattle when their farms were seized in the first fighting, so whole livelihoods have gone.

Their plight underlines the challenge facing Hamdok as he and his transitional government try to settle the conflict and bring the northeastern African country out of decades of diplomatic and financial isolation that was exacerbated by sanctions imposed over Darfur.

The makeshift camps that housed hundreds of thousands at the height of the violence have grown walls and infrastructure and solidified into settlements, making it harder to persuade people to resume long-abandoned lives.

And the societal and ethnic divisions that fuelled the worst of the conflict are still there in the background.

"WE WILL MEET YOUR DEMANDS"
A day later, Hamdok draws a crowd of hundreds as he tours Zam Zam camp just outside El Fasher on Monday.

The soft-spoken civilian greets them with the words "freedom, peace and justice" - a slogan chanted by the crowds that took to the streets across Sudan in this year in mass rallies that eventually ousted Bashir.

"We will meet your demands. We will work together," Hamdok tells the crowd.

He stays talking for most of the day but offers little in terms of concrete new proposals.

"Our conditions for a return are security, peace, education, health care," 21-year Ahmed Ibrahim tells Reuters during the visit. He was 10 when his family fled.

Hamdok took office in August under a three-year power sharing deal with the military.

Since then the transitional government has asked the United Nations and the African Union to keep operating their joint peacekeeping mission in Darfur - a force that Bashir was trying to shut down.

Khartoum is also taking part in peace talks with rebels from Darfur and other borderlands.

But diplomats say the sides hare having to wrestle with a conflict that has changed and fractured.

Rebels have fallen out and splintered with some now fighting for cash in Libya. Arab tribes have been competing among themselves as water resources dwindle, fuelling conflicts between farmers and nomads. Banditry is rife.

And the militias that fought in the early days of the conflict have changed leaders and names and taken up new roles in Sudan's shifting political landscape.

People in the camps say they are worried about former Arab militia - known as the Janjaweed - that they say joined the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the dominant force in Khartoum since Bashir's ouster.

Hamdok is guarded by a troops of army special forces during his visit.

EL FASHER, Sudan, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Saleha Nour sits selling nuts in the market in El Fasher, Darfur and dismisses her new prime minister's promise of a brighter new future with a wave of her hand.
She is talking on the eve of a visit by the premier - Abdalla Hamdok - who is coming to set out his plans to settle the near 17-year-old conflict in the west Sudanese region and repair the damage done by ousted president Omar al-Bashir.
But Nour has heard all the promises before and long given up hope of returning to the village she was forced to flee at the start of the fighting.
Violence may have subsided since the days when Bashir mobilised mostly Arab militia to crush an uprising by mostly non-Arab rebels, unleashing a wave of killings and mass displacement that Washington and others called genocide.

Title: A new strongman in Sudan? Experts aren't so sure | AP News
Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
CAIRO (AP) — When Sudan’s protest leaders signed a preliminary power-sharing agreement with the ruling military council in early July, they had no choice but to shake hands with the man many of them accuse of ordering a massacre just a month earlier.
Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, aparamilitary commander from Darfurwho is widely known as Hemedti, has emerged as Sudan’s main power broker in the months since the military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir.
He boasts tens of thousands of paramilitary forces who have spent years battling insurgents across Sudan as well as rebels in Yemen on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Experts say he can draw on his family’s vast livestock and gold mining operations in Darfur, as well as funding from Gulf Arab countries, to buy the support of tribal leaders and other local elites. That could be the recipe for a new patronage system like the one that kept al-Bashir in power for three decades.
But he also faces considerable headwinds: from the pro-democracy movement that has brought tens of thousands into the streets; from rival tribes and rebel groups that have battled his forces; and from elites in Khartoum, who view the onetime camel trader from distant Darfur as an outsider.
This week the protesters and the military announced anew breakthroughin their efforts to form a joint government that would pave the way to civilian rule. But the democratic transition remains fragile, and Hemedti’s rise — along with the growing resistance to it — could plunge the country into further chaos.

Hemedti leads the Rapid Support Forces, which grew out of the feared Janjaweed militias mobilized to put down a rebellion in Darfur in the early 2000s. The International Criminal Court, which charged al-Bashir and other top officials with genocide and crimes against humanity, has not brought charges against Hemedti. But rights groups say his forces burned villages andraped and killed civiliansduring a series of counterinsurgency campaigns over the last decade.
Spokesmen for the military and the RSF did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Hemedti’s past actions or present ambitions.
His forces have won a number of military victories against both rebels and rival Arab tribes, allowing his family to expand its livestock business and branch into the mining of gold, which emerged as Sudan’s biggest export after the secession of oil-rich South Sudan in 2011. He can also count on financial aid from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have contracted his forces to battle Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen.
There are few if any publicly available figures for the wealth at the disposal of Hemedti and the RSF. But in recent months he has boasted of depositing $1 billion in the Central Bank and paying the salaries of teachers and police.
“There are all the signs of someone who is trying to be the next military dictator of Sudan,” said Suliman Baldo, a senior researcher with the Enough Project. But he doubts Hemedti can sustain a patronage system like the one that kept al-Bashir in power.
“Sudan is totally exhausted, the national economy is in total collapse because of all of this, and there is no way Hemedti can sustain a national economy,” Baldo said.
DISTRUST IN KHARTOUM
In the months since al-Bashir’s ouster, Hemedti has worked out of an office in the presidential residence, receiving foreign envoys and other officials. But in the capital he is still seen as an outsider.
“The Khartoum elites are unanimous that Hemedti cannot be the ruler of Sudan, because as an uneducated Darfurian he is from the wrong class and the wrong place, and lacks the formal qualifications of education or staff college,” said Alex de Waal, a Sudan expert at Tufts University.
The protesters blame the RSF for the clearing of their main sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum on June 3, when security forces killed scores of people. Sudanese prosecutors have charged eight RSF officers, including a major general, with crimes against humanity but say the ruling generals did not order the crackdown.
Some protest leaders have called for the RSF to be disbanded, and both the Sudanese Professionals’ Association, which spearheaded the protests against al-Bashir, and the Communist Party have said Hemedti should be tried for alleged crimes in Darfur.
In the end, however, underinternational pressure, the protesters returned to talks with the military over a power-sharing deal. The two sides signed apreliminary documentlast month. While Hemedti is technically the deputy head of the military council, it was he who attended the signing ceremony.
The follow-up constitutional document signed Sunday would place the RSF under the command of the military. The protesters said it would also allow for the prosecution of military or civilian leaders if there is evidence of involvement in violence against protesters. Hemedti hailed the deal as a “win-win.”
RESISTANCE IN THE PROVINCES
Another route to power for Hemedti could run through the provinces, where neglect and marginalization by the central government have spawned rebellions going back decades.
“The most intriguing possibility today is that Hemedti will cash in on his credentials as a man of the far periphery, and build a support base that includes making agreements with the armed groups,” de Waal said. He says Hemedti knows the price of loyalty from personal experience, and that the RSF can more readily integrate the armed groups.
An activist from Hemedti’s Rizeigat tribe confirmed that he has paid “lots of money to tribal leaders” and provided jobs and other services to buy their loyalty.
“The opposition against him is silent because they fear the crackdown,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
Hemedti has also met with the leaders of various rebel groups — including those he has fought against — in Chad, South Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. But experts say he may still have too many enemies from his past campaigns.
Jerome Tubiana, another Sudan researcher, said Hemedti has “already failed to secure a strong base in the center, and his bet to represent all the peripheries, or even the whole Darfur, will be uneasy given his violent past.”
Baldo is also skeptical.
“In Darfur, he has victims by the millions and I don’t think they will rally behind him,” he said.

Title: Three killed in Port Sudan tribal clashes: Medics | News | Al Jazeera
Clashes kill 3 people, wound 24 others, as police impose nighttime curfew in Sudan’s main economic hub.
At least three people have been killed and 24 others wounded following clashes between two tribes in Port Sudan, medics said.
Sudanese police imposed a nighttime curfew following the incident on Monday.
The curfew in the Red Sea city,Sudan‘s main economic hub, came into effect at 5:00pm local time (15:00 GMT) and would remain until 5:00am local time (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the police said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.
It did not specify when the restrictions would be lifted.
Violence erupted when a prominent leader from Beni Amer tribe, Amin Daoud, held a political rally in the city which was opposed by members of Hadendowa tribe, the biggest in eastern Sudan, witnesses told AFP news agency by telephone.



“Tribal clashes killed three people and wounded 24 others,” a doctors committee close to Sudan’s umbrella protest movement, Forces of Freedom and Change, said in a statement.
The committee did not specify the exact causes of the deaths and wounds.
A witness said earlier on Monday that a bus was set on fire during the clashes that erupted near a hospital in central Port Sudan.
“The clashes stopped after members of the Rapid Support Force [RSF] intervened,” another witness said.
“The situation is still tense and RSF members are everywhere.”
Tribal clashes have often rocked the country, with many resulting in deaths.
Port Sudan also witnesses regular strikes by port workers demanding better work conditions and pay.

The Saudi-led coalition has been at war in Yemen since 2015 to support the country’s internationally backed government.
The war, sparked by the Houthis’ takeover of the capital in 2014, has claimed tens of thousands of lives, thrust millions to the brink of famine and spawned the world’s most devastating humanitarian crisis. Now it has ground into a long stalemate.
