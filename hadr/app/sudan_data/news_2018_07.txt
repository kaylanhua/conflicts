The security service arrested another son of the detained, notorious janjaweed leader sheikh Musa Hilal this week and put him on trial together with hundreds of other detainees.
The security service arrested another son of the detained, notorious janjaweed leader sheikh Musa Hilal this weekand put him on trial together with hundreds of other detainees.
Ahmed Musa is the deaf son of Hilal and he will join the 2,000 people from Hilal’s clan who have been arrested during an attack of the Rapid Support Forces on hisstronghold in Misteriya. Four of his sons are now in detention.
The detainees face a trial in a military court in Khartoum which started in March. Charges laid against them may be punishable by death in case of their conviction.
The Rizeigat tribe in Darfur has issues a statement recently, accusing the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of coercion. Some tribes have been forced to give false witness reports in the trial of Hilal that incriminate him concerning the events in El Sadar Tarma, they claimed.
Hilalrefused to operatewith the government’s disarmament campaign, after which the RSF executedplans for his arrest.
The Darfur Bar Association (DBA) has denounced the trial of Sheikh Musa Hilal. According to the Darfur lawyers, Hilal's “trial is a violation of the fair trial standards enshrined in the Sudanese Constitution and the law”. Hilal should immediately be transferred to a criminal court. “This would constitute the only guarantee for correcting the violated legal procedures.”
Military Intelligence arrests
Sudanese Military Intelligence arrested trader Abdelshakour Saleh from Deribat market in eastern Jebel Marra in South Darfur on Thursday. Traders at the scene told Radio Dabanga that MI members arrived at the market and took Abdelshakour immediately to the military garrison’s headquarters in Deribat.
A relative of Abdelshakour said that no one has been allowed to visit him so far. The family member is concerned that the trader might be subjected to torture at the headquarters of the MI.

Title: Fighting moves to south-west Jebel Marra, Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Clashes between armed opposition forces and Sudanese paramilitary forces continued in south-west Jebel Marra on Thursday morning.
Clashes between armed opposition forces and Sudanese paramilitary forces continued in south-west Jebel Marra on Thursday morning.
The clashes took place in Fundug Badiya, between Baldong and Golol, in Central Darfur's Nierteti locality. A spokesman for the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) led by Abdelwahid El Nur claimed that the rebels managed to kill 45 members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). A rebel fighter was killed.
Spokesman Waleed Mohamed Abakar added that they have seized various weapons and ammunition while one of the movement's soldiers was killed.
“The militias burned the Owa Ateem Quran School at night and attacked civilians during their retreat from the area,” Abakar claimed.
Exactly one week ago the SLM-AW also reported having repelled a military attack on the rebels’ sites at Buli and Aja in northern Jebel Marra, and claimed that the RSF damaged several villages during their withdrawal.
Spokesmen of the RSF or Sudanese army often refrain from commenting on military operations, however, two weeks ago the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the SLM-AW of carrying out isolated provocative attacks in Jebel Marra in Darfur to force the armed forces to respond militarily.
Shelling during clashes between government and rebel forces caused the death of six people and many others wounded in western and southern Jebel Marrain mid-June.

Title: How the U.S. and EU’s Cooperation with Sudan Rubberstamps Bad Behavior
byMohammed Osman
July 30, 2018
Guest Author,Human Rights,International Law,Local Voices
byMohammed Osman
July 30, 2018
In recent months, the United States and the European Union have been hard at work rebuildingtieswith Sudan andliftingsanctions,citingthe African nation’s improved cooperation on counterterrorism efforts and other matters. While the decision to ease sanctions on Sudan has attractedcriticismand commentary, including onJust Security(seehereandhere), there has been a lack of scrutiny of U.S. and EU support to security forces in Sudan who have beenaccusedof committing serious human rights violations against Sudanese citizens and migrant communities.
By developing closer ties with, and providing assistance to Sudan in the name of “fighting terror” or “solving the migrant crisis,” the U.S. and the EU are taking a real risk of legitimizing human rights abuses and making themselves complicit in violations of international law.
U.S. and Sudan’s troublesome counterterrorism partnership
Though U.S. assistance to, and cooperation with, foreign governments and forces with questionable human rights records is nothing new, greater attention to the United States’ relationship with Sudanese forces is needed, particularly as the two countries move towards normalizing relations.
The Sudanese government has a long history of counterterrorism cooperation with the United States and other Western nations. In the 1990s, Sudanese intelligence officials cooperated with their French counterparts to arrest and deliver themIlich Ramírez Sánchez, known as Carlos “the Jackal.” Sudanese intelligence also kept a close eye on Osama Bin Laden when he spent five years in Sudan, eventually seizing his assets, and offering to extradite him to Saudi Arabia or America after U.S. officials demanded that Sudan expel him.
The full extent of current U.S. assistance and cooperation with Sudanese authorities and forces is, however, opaque. Through a limited number of publicly available reports, it is clear that the United States has been working to warm up its relations with Sudan and its armed forces in particular. For instance, in early 2017, Obama administration officials disclosed toThe New York Timesthat the Sudanese government had improved cooperation on counterterrorism efforts, citing as evidence that the Sudanese government “allowed two visits by American operatives to restricted border areas in Libya.” That same year, the United States and Sudan reportedlyresumeda level of military cooperation when the military attachés of both countries returned to their respective embassies in Khartoum and Washington after a 28-year gap. In April 2017, Sudan wasinvitedto participate in meetings at U.S. Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) headquarters in Germany, an invitation that was not previously extended due to Sudan’s designation as a “state sponsor of terrorism.” In August 2017, AFRICOM’s head of civil-military engagement, Alexander M. Laskaris,arrivedin Khartoum to discuss counterterrorism cooperation with Sudanese armed forces and fighting the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA.) That same month, Sudan wasinvitedto join U.S. -Egyptian military training exercises.
U.S. engagement with Sudan endures despite the fact that Sudan’s National Intelligence Security Service (NISS), Khartoum’s main force in implementing counter-terrorism cooperation in the country and region, has a record of committing serious human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch for instance has repeatedlydocumentedthe “abusive tactics” of the NISS — including the use of torture against real or perceived political opponents, the detention of activists, students, lawyers, doctors, community leaders, and those perceived to be critical of the government. TheU.S. State Departmentitself claimed in 2016 that “the NISS continued to show a pattern of widespread disregard for rule of law, committing major abuses, such as extrajudicial and other unlawful killings, torture, beatings, rape and other cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.”
Despite knowledge of the NISS’ record, a former U.S intelligence officer in Sudanconfirmedin 2010 that the U.S. government had been training the NISS and other Sudanese security bodies on counterterrorism, cyber crimes, and human trafficking. The same official suggested that trainings conducted by the CIA for NISS officers are not new, and that such cooperation started in the early days after September 11, 2001. More recently, in 2017, the then-director of the NISS reportedly said in apress conferencethat agency operatives were receiving “technical assistance” from their U.S counterparts, without providing any further details.
Sudanese forces and officials have also allegedly assisted the United States in military and intelligence operations against terrorist groups. As recently as 2016, Sudan’s former Ambassador to the U.S, Mr. Muawia Osman Khalidacknowledgedthat Sudan passed on critical intelligence information on terrorist groups in the region to the United States, and noted that Sudan could “increase support on the ground in conjunction with U.S. forces.”
The United States is also said to have relied on intelligence gathered by the NISS outside Sudan, mainly in Somalia, Iraq, and Syria. In one instance, theLos Angeles Timesreported that the U.S. relied on information provided by Sudanese intelligence’s informants among Iraqi insurgents in 2007. Sudan’s former foreign minister once said in aninterviewthat “Sudan already has served as the eyes and ears of the CIA in Somalia.”
EU assistance to stem migrant flows
The partnership between Sudan and the European Union also demands further scrutiny. Thanks to Sudan’s strategic location, the EU has worked with Sudanese authorities to stem the flow of migrants to Europe. A key part of this cooperation is theKhartoum Process, defined as a “platform for political cooperation and regional collaboration on migration amongst the countries along the migration route between the Horn of Africa and Europe.”
The EU’s arrangement with Sudan has attracted widespread criticism from human rights groups due to fears that it bolsters the legitimacy of Sudan’s infamous Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF is a counterinsurgency forces that was formally integrated into the Sudanese armed forces in 2017, and has since been deployed to Sudan’s northern borders with Libya in an effort to stem migrant flows. While the RSF’s commanderboastsabout interdicting migrants on behalf of the European Union, his forces have beenaccusedof directing attacks against civilians in North and Central Darfur andparticipatingin the trafficking of migrants to Libya.
RSF violations have also been documented in numerous reports, including several by the United Nations. The U.N. Panel of Experts on Sudan for instance,reportedthat the RSF has engaged in large-scale operations in Darfur, attacking hundreds of civilians and destroying villages. A Human Rights Watchreportstated that the RSF killed many civilians in Darfur when they refused to leave their homes or give up their livestock, or when they tried to stop RSF fighters from raping them or members of their family. In September 2017, the RSFannouncedthat it killed smugglers in clashes along the Sudanese-Libyan border, but it is unclear whether any civilians were killed in the process as the RSF has refused to disclose the status of those it killed. A 2017 U.N. Panel of Expertreporton Sudan casts further doubt on the Sudanese government claims that RSF forces killed human traffickers, when it noted that the RSF personnel killed 17 members of a rival group of Arab militias.
In spite ofclaimsfrom Brussels that no EU support would go towards the Sudanese government or the RSF, there have beenreportsthat the EU plan entails sending cameras, scanners, and servers for registering refugees to the Sudanese regime, as well providing training to Khartoum’s border police and assisting with the construction of two camps with detention rooms for migrants.  Additionally, Oxfamanalysisfound that of the €400 million allocated through the EU fund, only 3% percent went towards developing safe and regular routes for migration – the rest was spent on migration control.
(The RSF is not the only Sudanese security force tied to documented rights violations against migrants. A number of asylum seekers, the majority of which were from Ethiopia and Eritrea, were violently dispersed and beaten by Sudanese police after peacefulprotestsin Khartoum last year.)
A troubling narrative linking terrorism to migration
Troublingly, Sudan, the United States, and EU-member states are employing a narrative that has directly and indirectly merged both terrorism and migration. Sudan and the United Kingdom have, for instance, engaged in a “strategic dialogue”to address migration and terrorism as part of the same process. Ameetingin 2016 between Sudanese and Italian foreign ministers focused mainly on border security, but also addressed terrorism issues.
Dealing with trafficking, smuggling, migration, and terrorism under the same framework and enforcement body as the­ “fight against terrorism” poses significant risks to migrants, including the lessening of legal protections that should be afforded to migrants and refugees. Though a government may have legitimate concerns that terrorists may exploit gaps in border security, there is a limit to what border control efforts and migration policies can do to prevent domestic acts of terrorism. Instead, such policies can lead to further alienation or discrimination against vulnerable groups that extremists can exploit. As Ben Emmerson, the former Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights noted in hisreporton the impact of counterterrorism measures on migration, “there is little evidence […] that terrorists take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalization than others, and research shows that very few refugees have actually carried out acts of terrorism.” Thus, the narrative which securitizes migration policies and links it to countering terrorism only makes it easier for countries such as Sudan to deploy agencies such as the NISS and RSF to deal with migration flows to Europe thereby putting migrants and refugees in even more vulnerable place.
The impact of US-EU assistance on the human rights situation in Sudan
Greater support to Khartoum by the United States and the European Union only helps legitimize an authoritarian regime and further establishes how human rights can be secondary to narrowly-defined national security interests.  The effective dismissal of human rights concerns by the U.S. and other Western nations threatens to bolster harmful policies and practices that erroneouslyconflatecounter-terror measures and migration control. The tradeoff can already be seen with public criticisms of Sudan’s record either muted or waning. Indeed the regime continues to engage in repressive tactics including bycurbing political pluralism, arresting dissidents,discriminatingagainst religious or ethnic minorities, restrictingwomen’s rightsthrough strict moral laws, and engaging incorruption.
The tendency to compromise on human rights in the name of countering terrorism and during migration control efforts is not unique to Sudan. But continued support of a government engaged in rights abuses does pose a serious threat to fundamental principles of democracy and the rule of law that both the United States and countries that make up the European Union profess to uphold. Further assistance to Sudan without effective oversight or measures to prevent abuse may only strengthen an illiberal regime and increase instability.
These concerns, in addition to potential abuse stemming from counterterrorism and border control activities, should cause U.S. and EU officials, who may be at risk of complicity in Sudanese force abuses, to demand a higher level of scrutiny of how their assistance is being used.
Questions that Congress and the European Parliament should ask about relations with Sudan:
In principle, cooperation among states to fight terrorism or any sort of threats to life is highly desired. However, the level of secrecy and lack of transparency combined with the unchallenged record of human rights abuses by Sudanese authorities all make a good case for observers to be concerned and call for further scrutiny.
Going forward, the U.S. Congress and parliaments in European states should ask their government the following questions about assistance to Sudan:

Title: Renewed campaign against unlicensed vehicles in North Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The security services in El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, have launched a major campaign to control unlicensed vehicles that have allegedly recently entered the state from across the border in Libya.
The security services in El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, have launched a major campaign to control unlicensed vehicles that have allegedly recently entered the state from across the border in Libya.
The latest renewed campaign is in response to a decision by the High Commission for the Collection of Unlicensed Firearms and Vehicles that met in El Fasher on Sunday.
The Commission issued a decision to confiscate all unlicensed vehicles in favour of the state without any compensation to the owners.
Eyewitnesses told Radio Dabanga that about 12,000 vehicles at Zurog area in North Darfur were being held by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.
Ongoing campaign
The latest action is part of an ongoing campaign that was launched last year. According to Presidential Decree 419 of 2017, “illegal weapons, ammunition, and vehicles are to be handed immediately to the Sudan Armed Forces, the state commissioner, or the nearest military or police unit. Any legal action will be taken in line with Sudan’s Criminal Law, the Public Safety Act, and the Arms and Ammunition Act of 1986.”
Arms collection
Nearly one year ago, Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the RSF, Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone,more than 12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.

Title: Kassala leaders call for Khartoum to lift State of Emergency - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The National Legislature of Sudan announced an emergency session within the next ten days to discuss the presidential decree to extend the State of Emergency in the state of Kassala and its approval for another six months.
The National Legislature of Sudan announced an emergency session within the next ten days to discuss the presidential decree to extend the State of Emergency in the state of Kassala and its approval for another six months.
A wide range of residents of the state announced their categorical rejection of the extension of the State of Emergency, pointing out that there is no justification for it.
Abdallah Musa representing the community leadership called in an interview with Radio Dabanga for immediate lifting of the State of Emergency rather than extending it. Musa described it as “unjustified and meaningless”.
He described the reasons for imposing the causes of the state of emergency in Kassala as being one of the mysteries, stressing the absence of turbulent security conditions that call for this.
He wondered about the connection of the imposition of emergencies with regional files or campaigns of the European Union to combat illegal immigration.
Panic
Musa reported the increasing panic and among the residents.
He explained that the forces in charge of implementing the emergency are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia who have committed documented violations against the people of Darfur.
He cited cases of killings and theft of the property by RSF members during the first six months of the state of emergency in Kassala.
He said that the state of emergency has caused the deterioration of the economic and living conditions of, pointing to the complete paralysis in the markets of the state, which has affected the situation of stability.

Title: Annan sees positive signals that Sudan will cooperate with resolution | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
A day before he is due to brief the Council on the latest developments inSudan, Mr. Annan told reporters at United Nations Headquarters in New York that he expects Khartoum will cooperate with the resolution adopted last Friday by the Council.
Thatresolutionpaves the way for the 15-member Council to introduce measures under Article 41 of theUN Charteragainst the Sudanese Government if it does not take action on commitments made last month in a joint communiqué with the UN. Those measures include economic penalties, restricting transport and communications, and severing diplomatic relations.
The Secretary-GeneralsaidKhartoum's reaction to the passage of the resolution proved it "has got the message loud and clear."
He added that the Council wants to see "results on the ground" - not necessarily that the Sudanese authorities have fixed the problems within 30 days, but that they have shown "demonstrably that they are determined, that they are serious, and that they are protecting the people. And this has to be seen by the people and felt by the people, [and] not by public declarations."
Asked about press reports that Khartoum considered any 30-day deadline to undermine separate agreements to take action within 90 days, Mr. Annan said the 90-day agreement refers only to humanitarian commitments - such as making access easier for aid workers and allowing relief supplies to enter.
Mr. Annan spoke positively of yesterday's meeting in Khartoum of the Joint Implementation Mechanism (JIM), a body set up by Sudan and the UN to make sure the content of the communiqué is put into practice.
Jan Pronk, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Sudan and the co-chair of JIM, told the BBC that Sudan has made positive progress in implementing its commitments.
Mr. Pronk said that a UN-Sudanese observer mission to the area last week also found no evidence that Khartoum is continuing to force some of the IDPs to return to their home villages against their will.
But he said that many Janjaweed militiamen remain active, causing "a great deal of insecurity," and that the activities of two rebel groups opposed to Khartoum are also adding to the insecurity.
The Janjaweed stand accused of killing and raping thousands of civilians since two rebel groups inDarfurrose up against the Government last year. UN officials have also said that the Janjaweed have been armed or sponsored by Khartoum.

Title: UN envoy takes part in resumption of peace talks for southern Sudan | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Jan Pronk, the Secretary-General's Special Representative forSudan, is in Naivasha to participate in talks between representatives of Khartoum and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A).
UN spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters today that Mr. Pronk was invited by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which is mediating the talks.
Sudan's First Vice-President Ali Othman Taha and SPLM/A Chairman John Garang are expected to meet later today in Naivasha to discuss how to reach agreement to end the conflict that has cost 2 million lives since it began in 1983. Between 3 million and 4 million people are internally displaced as a result.
The Naivasha talks stalled earlier this year after the two sides initialled a series of protocols aimed at resolving some of the issues in dispute, including the distribution and control of resources in southern Sudan.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pronk's Deputy for Humanitarian Affairs, Manuel Aranda da Silva, met Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom for talks yesterday in Khartoum. Mr. Blair was in the Sudanese capital for discussions with Government ministers over the humanitarian and security crises in the Darfur region.
During their talks, Mr. Aranda da Silva stressed to Mr. Blair the importance of sustained support for humanitarian operations inDarfurand for ensuring that rapid assistance is available for Sudan as soon as any peace agreement is signed.
In other news, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women, Yakin Ertürk, issued astatementdetailing the violence suffered by women and girls during attacks by Janjaweed militias against villages in Darfur.
Ms. Ertürk also recommended that Khartoum ratify theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women(CEDAW) and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the rights of women in Africa.
Such a move would start a dialogue about how to improve legal protection for the rights of Sudanese women, she said.

مواضيع وابحاث سياسية
يوم الثلاثاء الموافق 17 يوليو الجارى فاجأ القطاع السياسى للمؤتمر الوطنى (الحزب الحاكم ) المجتمع السياسى و الاعلامى السودانى وهو يخرج إلى الصحافة باعتماده البشير مرشحا للحزب في الانتخابات التي ستجرى بعد أقل من عامين، متجاوزا بذلك المؤتمر العام في أبريل 2019 و الذى كان من المتوقع ان يقرر فى امر ترشح البشير، اما تجاهل الاخوان المسلمين للدستور الذى يمنع ترشح البشير مرة اخرى فليس امرا مستغربا ، ذلك ان الاخوان المسلمين لم يكونوا جادين طوال تاريخهم السياسى فى تعاملهم مع رموز الدولة مثل الشعب ، الدستور و الديمقراطية و المؤسسات .ارجو ان يكون ذلك ايذانا بانقشاع الوهم الذى ظل يسيطر على تفكير الكثيرين فى المعارضه السودانية ظانين ان الاختلافات الداخلية فى اوساط حزب الاخوان المسلمين ستؤدى لانهياره ، من الواضح ان جل اختلافات معظم الاخوان المسلمين مع مركز السلطة ليس خلافا فكريا او منهجيا بل يتركز الاختلاف على مدى تمكين الجماعة و قياداتها من السلطة ، واهم الدلائل على ذلك هو الاجتماعات المحمومة التى شهدها مقر الاخوان المسلمين التاريخى بضاحية العيلفون شرق الخرطوم يوم الجمعة 27 ابريل 2018 الماضى وماتلاها من اجتمعات سرية لااطراف من قيادات الاخوان المسلمين فى مناطق مختلفة من الخرطوم ، ويبدو ان تلك الاجتماعات توصلت لضرورة إلتفاف الاخوان المسلمين حول البشير ومن ثم اجتزاب انصار السنة وبقية تنظيمات الاسلامويين للوقوف مع البشير ( وهى اصلا تنظيمات لم تعترض ابدا على البشير ) ، لذلك يظل الرهان على خلافات الاسلامويين التى ستؤدى لسقوط البشير او على الاقل عدم ترشيحه ، رهان خاسر يعتمد على الامنيات التى لن تتحقق ابدا .بعد كل الحوارات الصحية التى دارت بين الذين يؤيدون دخول المعارضه انتخابات 2020 بحجة انها تتيح التقاء القوى السياسية بمختلف قطاعات الشعب السودانى ، وبين المعارضين لدخول المعارضه لانتخابات 2020 ، وانا بالطبع منهم ، تبين كل التطورات الاخيرة حقيقة ان تنظيم الاخوان المسلمين لن يتيح الفرصة لاى جهة معارضة او غير معارضه بممارسة اى نشاط يمكن ان يؤدى لزعزعة سلتطهم و انتقاص تمكنهم .ليس خافيا على احد ان البلاد تسير نحو الانهيار الكامل بخطى واسعة ،و ان الانهيار الاقتصادى بلغ مداه ، و انعدام الخدمات الصحية و التعليم ، والفقر المدقع الذى اصاب اغلب الشعب ، و الجوع صار حقيقة لا يختلف حولها شخصان، وان ما نراه اليوم من انفلات الشرطة و القوى النظامية الاخرى و انتشار استخدام السلاح و السطو المسلح و الاغتصاب نتيجة حتمية لثقافة العنف و الانفلات الامنى و الفوضى التى ميزت منهج السلطة طوال فترة حكمها منذ انقلابها على الحكم فى 30 يونيو 1989 خاصة فى الريف السودانى ، وكما اشرت من قبل ان السلطة ابان الدكتاتوريات الفاشية المتلسطة الاحادية المتطرفة تفرض ثقافتها على المجتمع و الدولة المختطف مؤسساتها ،فمنذ البداية تميزت سلطة وحكم الاخوان المسلمين باستخدام العنف المفرط ، ابتدأ باختطاف مؤسسات الدولة فى السعى نحو التمكين ، والفصل الجماعى من الخدمة المدنية و الاعتقلات و التعذيب فى بيوت الاشباح . إنشاء مليشيا الدفاع الشعبى و استخدمها فى حرب الجنوب ، انشاء مليشيا الدبابين ابان حرب الجنوب ، ثم انشأ مليشيا الجنجويد عام 2003 من اجل قمع الثورة فى دارفور .إذا العنف جزء اساسى فى النظام الفكري والعاطفي للاخوان المسلمين ، و بالتالى فى بنية دولة الاخوان المسلمين ، وبالتالى جزء اساسى من الثقافة السائدة فى السودان الذى يسيطر عليه وعلى مقدراته الاخوان المسلمين، حتى ان الغناء صار معبرا عن العنف عن طريق استخدام ادوات العنف (القنبلة مثلا ) كمعبر عن الجمال ( بت قنبلة )! ، كيف يمكن تشبيه الجمال بالقنبله ويستساغ التشبيه ويطرب له ، لولا سيادة ثقافة سلطة الاخوان المسلمين ، ثقافة العنف و القتل و الاغتصابات ؟زاد العنف خاصة بعد ان تم دمج مليشيا الجنجويد فى جهاز الامن و تحويل اسمها الى (الدعم السريع ) فى محاولة غسلها من الجرائم التى ارتكبتها من قتل جماعى وحرق للقرى واغتصابات ، تلك الجرائم ضد الانسانية التى جعلت محكمة الجنايات الدولية تتهم رئيس البلاد وعدد من مساعدية بالتطهير العرقى ، و بالفعل تم استخدام المليشيات القبلية فى كثير من عمليات جهاز الامن فى الريف السودانى .تم استخدام مليشيا الجنجويد فى قلب الحضر السودانى ، فى العاصمة الخرطوم ابان انتفاضة سبتمبر 2013 حينما تم اغتيال اكثر من 200 شاب وشابةتواصلت محاولات غسل مليشيا الجنجويد بضمها فى يناير 2014 للجيش السودانى واتباعها مباشرة لرئيس الجمهورية ،حيث اودع الرئيس مجلس السلطة ( المجلس الوطنى) ، يوم الإثنين 15 ياناير 2017 مسودة قانون خاص ينظم تلك القوات تحت اسم "قانون قوات الدعم السريع"، ويقضي بتبعيتها إلى وزارة الدفاع، لتصبح جزءاًمن الجيش السوداني، بعد أن كانت تابعة إلى جهاز الأمن.ولان مليشيا الجنجويد ظلت طوال تاريخها فوق القانون لا توجد جهة تحاسبها حتى عندما اعتدت على ضباط الجيش و الشرطة ، لذك فان سلوكها الاجرامى المنفلت سينتقل الى كل القوى النظامية ، ذلك ان سلوك الجنجويد المنفلت الاجرامى يتم تنفيذه تحت حماية اعلى السلطات و المؤسسات فى الدولة ، وسينتقل فى سياق تمثل السطوة والقوة والجبروت الى القوات النظامية خاصة فى هذه الظروف ، ظروف الانفلات ، حيث يسود خوف السلطة وهلعها.الانهيار لن ينتظر المعارضه فى تحركاتها البطئة تجاه الاسئلة الوطنية الحرجة و العاجلة، لذلك ليس امام المعارضة السودانية سوى التحرك بسرعة و البحث عن انسب صيغة لتحالف وطنى واسع يرتكز على برنامج وطنى متفق عليه يعالج قضايا الفترة الانتقالية ويحدد الفترة الزمنية للفترة الانتقالية بناء على الفترة الزمنية الحقيقية التى يحتاجها تنفيذ القضايا التى تطرحها الفترة الانتقالية، بحيث يضمن ذلك استمرارية التبادل السلمى للسلطة و اقامة مؤسسات الدولة و يمهد لتاسيس البلاد على المواطنة و ترسيخ الديمقراطية بتثبيت ركنها الاقتصادى الى جانب السياسي .من اجل انجاز ذلك لابد من ان تشمل المعارضة الرسمية المتمثلة فى قوى الاجماع الوطنى و قوى نداء السودان و بقية المعارضة الرسمية خارج هاذين التحالفين ، ان تشمل منظمات المجتمع المدنى و المنظمات الشعبية التى نشأت فى سياق مقاومة النظام و الذى سلبها حقوقها وهددت اجراءاته وجودها ، مثل ( مقاومة السدود ، التعدين الذى لايشمل شروط السلامة ، مجموعات مقاومة نزع الاراضى ، ممثلى النازحين و المهجرين ، واى منظمات شعبية سلمية اخرى مقاومة للنظام ، الحركات الشبابية و النسوية .يجب على المعارضه السودانية ان تقوم بمسئولياتها الوطنية و ان تتجرد فى سبيل الوطن ، و ان تسطف اليوم قبل الغد فى تحالف وطنى واسع وفق مشروع وطنى لا تستثنى إلا من ابى ، واعتقد انه عندما يشعر الشعب بان للمعارضة رؤية واضحة وجادة حول مستقبل البلاد ، عندها ستتحرك قطاعاته المختلفة وتشارك فى الحراك الوطنى من اجل تغيير النظام.* صحفى وباحث سودانى مقيم ببريطانيا#عبدالغفار_سعيد (هاشتاغ)اشترك في قناة ‫«الحوار المتمدن» على اليوتيوبحوار مع الكاتب البحريني هشام عقيل حول الفكر الماركسي والتحديات التي يواجهها اليوم، اجرت الحوار: سوزان امينحوار مع الكاتبة السودانية شادية عبد المنعم حول الصراع المسلح في السودان وتاثيراته على حياة الجماهير، اجرت الحوار: بيان بدلكيف تدعم-ين الحوار المتمدن واليسار والعلمانية

Title: Humanitarian supplies airlifted into eastern Chad - UN refugee agency | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Aircraft carrying medical kits, fuel bladders, communications equipment and other relief items have been shuttling between the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, and Abeche since Saturday, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Jennifer Pagonis said.
Briefing reportersin Geneva, Ms. Pagonis said the French planes transported some 40 tons of supplies - originally sent from Denmark - over the weekend. Aid agencies began airlifting supplies after heavy rains in eastern Chad and western Sudan made many roads impassable.
Ms. Pagonis said some of the medical kits are designed specifically to treat cholera, and have been sent to at least three refugee camps in case there is a sudden outbreak of the disease.
At least 144,000 people from Darfur have been transferred into UNHCR's nine camps in eastern Chad. These camps are away from the border and the threat of raids by the notorious Janjaweed militias. Another 14,800 people are living at Am Nabak, a separate site away from the border.
Ms. Pagonis said work will start tomorrow on setting up a new camp at Treguine. This camp, which will be run by the International Federation of the Red Cross, is expected to house up to 17,000 people, including many from the congestedUNHCRcamp at Breidjing.
Meanwhile, Japan announced yesterday that it will donate $3.7 million so that the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) can conduct campaigns in Sudan against polio, measles and malaria.
UN officials estimate 1.2 million people are internally displaced within Darfur, a region the size of France, because of deadly attacks against civilians by the Janjaweed and also fighting between Government forces and two rebel groups. The situation in Darfur has been described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

♦Sudan's FM condemns 'delaying actions' to Unamid exit plans
July 6 – 2018 KHARTOUMThe Foreign Ministry has condemned actions that delay the implementation of the withdrawal from Darfur by the AU-UN peacekeeping mission. The ministry has set deadlines for Unamid’s exit in 2020.
On Thursday, the Sudanese foreign ministry announced that the recommendations of the strategic review team have been used to set the deadline in 2020, also as promised by the African Union Peace and Security Council. The council extended the mission’smandatefor a year in June.
In a pressstatementthe Foreign Ministry added that it had noticed “moves by some parties to put obstacles in the way of Unamid’s exit as scheduled”. The moves are “creating confusion and attempting to cast doubt on the achieved stability through false pretexts and feeble arguments”.
Three armed opposition groups, namely the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) led by Minni Minawi, the SLM-Transitional Council (SLM-TC) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) have recently petitioned for the UN Security Council to reconsider plans to withdraw the peacekeepers from Darfur. Also, Amnesty International released satellite images showing13 villages burned and destroyedin Jebel Marra area and called on the Security Council to not downsize Unamid, the “only source of security and safety” for Darfur civilians.

Title: Eastern Sudanese demand end of State of Emergency in Kassala - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Eastern Sudanese activists are collecting signatures for the abolition of the State of Emergency in Kassala.
Eastern Sudanese activists are collecting signatures for the abolition of the State of Emergency in Kassala.
Hundreds of eastern Sudanese politicians, journalists, writers, artists, and activists have already signed a petition demanding the end of the State of Emergency in the state.
The national parliament will soon discuss the extension of the security measure in Kassala and North Kordofan, imposed by the Sudanese government in early January this year.
Khartoum said that the security measure was needed for an extension of the nationwide disarmament campaign which started in August 2017 in Darfur. Thousands of paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were deployed in Kassala.
Politicians,community leaders, and activists in eastern Sudan howeverdoubted the reasonsfrom the start. “The Sudanese Constitution conditions a declaration of a State of Emergency with disasters and epidemics or foreign intervention,” a lawyer told Radio Dabanga at the time.
Mohamed Iheimir, head of the Unified National Unionist Party in Kassala commented that “Implementing such a measure aims to cut the way for any possible street protests from against the passing of the 2018 budget, the repeated sharp rise of basic consumer prices, and the escalating fuel and wheat shortages.”
The text of the memorandum cited a large number of arrests and summons by agents of the National Intelligence ans Security Service (NISS) against a number of people, many of them traders, in the state. They were arbitrarily detained and held in prisons of Kassala, Port Sudan, and Khartoum, until they were released again without having been charged.
Kassala police as well detained people and held them without charges for periods ranging from three to four months without being brought to trial or given the opportunity to defend themselves, the memorandum says. Most of them are merchants or political activists.
The memorandum further referred to the suffering of residents of Kassala because of the State of Emergency. The property of many people in Kassala, especially those from low-income rural areas, has been seized by the authorities. In addition, many restrictions have been imposed on the transport of basic commodities from Khartoum and between towns and rural areas in the state, which caused the already soaring prices to rise even more.

Title: Sudan, EU: Further cooperation to combat illegal migration - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Khartoum and the European Union EU have launched a joint initiative to combat human trafficking and illegal migration in Sudan, a main source and transit country for many refugees attempting to travel to Europe.
Khartoum and the European Union EU have launched a joint initiative to combat human trafficking and illegal migration in Sudan, a main source and transit country for many refugees attempting to travel to Europe.
The Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration for Sudan was signed by the EU, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Migration Agency and the government of Sudan on Thursday in the Sudanese capital.
The initiative receives funding through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and will be implemented by the IOM, with a budget of €45 million for the entire Horn of Africa (Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia). It runs over the course of three years.
On Sunday Sudan’s Foreign Minister El Dirdeiry Mohamed Ahmed met with the EU Ambassador to Sudan Jean-Michel Dumond to discuss the new initiative, as well as ways to enhance EU developmental assistance to Sudan, according to the official Sudanese News Agency (SUNA).
Dumond held a speech following the event. “Managing migration poses challenges for many countries – this applies to EU Member States and of course also to African countries… The initiative we launch today bridges both internal and external aspects, and indeed illustrates the complexity of the migration phenomenon.
“We fully realise that Sudan is currently facing difficult times.”- Jean-Michel Dumond
“We place a great emphasis on the voluntary nature of the returns, and on the need to support also the communities to which persons are returning. In 2017, more than 15,000 individuals safely returned from the EU to their home countries in Africa and were supported with reintegration assistance. As a point of reference, EU Member States granted asylum to over 720,000 persons in the year 2016, and in the year 2017, to 382,000.”
Partner Sudan
Dumond: “Sustainability is a crucial element of any EU development cooperation programme, and indeed it is vital that we seek to ensure that the money of the European tax payer is well spent… In this respect, establishment of a National Coordination Mechanism on migration in Sudan is eagerly awaited.
“We fully realise that Sudan is currently facing difficult times. We are seeking to find innovative ways in which to support the people of Sudan in this challenging period. We are also seeking, in the very near future, to work closer with relevant stakeholders to ensure a more robust economy and financial framework that will allow for enhanced delivery of social services and other basic needs.”
‘Important element’
In October 2017, Dumond referred to migration as “an important element of our engagement with the government of Sudan.
“There are considerable flows of cross border migrants emanating from or passing through Darfur. The EU is seeking to work with the Government of Sudan on this issue, in particular with the Sudanese Migration Coordination Mechanism, which is yet to be fully constituted. This work will be carried out in full respect of International Conventions and Human Rights, and in accordance with the robust EU accountability mechanisms.
“Our support, as is the case for all our work in Sudan, will be channelled via relevant UN organisations, EU Member State Agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations in close coordination with the Sudanese government.”
‘Dubious border management’
International organisations have shown doubts whether the funding for Sudan’s border migration management to combat illegal migration will be channelled through non-Sudanese groups. The USA-based activist organisationEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU’s financial support to Sudan in mitigating and combating illegal migration would assist the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces – whichthe EU denied.
In April this year, theNew York Times also onlinepointed to the EU “quietly getting its hands dirty” by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records. Radio Dabanga then reported that the commander of RSF, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti) wantedthe international community to recognisethe efforts of his troops to halt human trafficking.
Last month Sudan and Chad agreed to enhance theirbordersecurity cooperationand promote economic, social and political relations on the joint border area. On June 2, Libya’s foreign ministry at the Government of National Accord signed a quadripartite agreement to control and monitor borders among Libya, Sudan, Chad and Niger in Ndjamena.
EU Trust Fund
In April 2016, the EU established the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa: it contains the development aid package of €100 million aimed to tackle the root causes of instability, irregular migration and displacement. Targeted areas are eastern Sudan, Darfur and South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Another €40 million is appointed to Better Migration Management, supporting the process in Khartoum.
An additional amount of €15 million should improve the living conditions of refugees and host communities in eastern Sudan (Kassala) and Khartoum and strengthen the capacity of local authorities.

Title: La crisis de los inmigrantes | Noticias
Europa y EE.UU. ensayan acciones para frenar las inmigraciones masivas, usando a países limítrofes y grupos de mercenarios.

La crisis mundial de los migrantes y refugiados que está afectando al hemisferio occidental, alcanzó un punto sin retorno. Millones de personas indocumentadas intentan llegar a los Estados Unidos o a Europa mientras las grandes potencias endurecen sus controles fronterizos, o peor aún, derivan en países limítrofes la responsabilidad de frenarlos.
Dos escenarios han conmocionado a la opinión pública mundial en las últimas semanas. Por un lado, el Mediterráneo Central, donde el domingo 10 de junio el barco Aquarius de la ONG Sos Mediterranée rescató del mar a más de 600 migrantes tras días a la deriva por la negativa del gobierno de Italia y de Malta a darles asilo. Nueve días después, el martes 19, una patera de madera con un número desconocido de refugiados se hundió dejando sólo 5 sobrevivientes. El mismo día, otra patera de hule corrió la misma suerte logrando un grupo de pescadores salvar a la mitad de las personas a bordo. El miércoles 20, la Guardia Costera libia realizó una operación frente a Garabulli, donde 50 personas perdieron la vida. Unas 234 personas a bordo de la nave Lifeline, de la ONG alemana Seenotrettung, esperan desde hace días que se les asigne un puerto, al cierre de esta edición.
Por otro lado, la frontera caliente entre Estados Unidos y México, donde miles de niños fueron alejados de sus padres y llevados a establecimientos más parecidos a una cárcel que a un refugio, con la intención de disuadir a esas familias que quedarse al norte del Río Bravo no es una buena idea. Jeff Sessions, fiscal general de Estados Unidos anunció la semana pasada las nuevas restricciones para los solicitantes de asilo: no hay lugar para las víctimas de la violencia de las bandas organizadas ni por abuso doméstico. Por su parte, el verborrágico Donald Trump atacó por Twitter al sistema judicial estadounidense, exigiendo la deportación directa a todo inmigrante ilegal, sin juicio previo, mientras grita como desaforado exigiendo una reforma migratoria de tolerancia cero hacia los ilegales.
Según la Casa Blanca, unas 50 mil personas llegan cada mes a la frontera con México. Si bien no hay cifras oficiales, la agencia Associated Press estipula que más de 2 mil niños han sido separados de sus padres sólo entre abril y junio de este año, al intentar cruzar de forma irregular a Estados Unidos.
Del otro lado del Atlántico, 41.381 migrantes han llegado por el mar a Europa en lo que va del año, más de mil se han ahogado intentándolo, y otros 7 mil han sido “rescatados” por las fuerzas libias, según datos de la ACNUR, la Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados. El año pasado, la cifra de migrantes llegó a los 200 mil.
El origen. San Pedro Sula en Honduras, es uno de los lugares con el mayor número de asesinatos del mundo producto del enfrentamiento entre la Salvatrucha mara y la 18 Mara. El control del territorio de las bandas armadas incluye desde hace unos años un nuevo integrante: los desplazamientos realizados por la lucha del gobierno mexicano contra los cárteles de la droga, que se han replegado hacia América Central.
La posición estratégica de San Pedro Sula lo convierte en la principal ruta de los narcotraficantes colombianos y mexicanos camino a los Estados Unidos.
El llamado Triángulo Norte integrado por El Salvador, Honduras y Guatemala, ha desplazado en los últimos años a México en cantidad de inmigrantes ilegales hacia el país del norte. Si bien las personas que huyen de los estados de Michoacán y Guerrero, también se cuentan de a miles, México además de ser un país emisor, es también un país de tránsito. Según el informe publicado por ACNUR, “Mujeres a la huida”, El Salvador, Guatemala y Honduras ocupan el primero, tercero y séptimo lugares respectivamente en tasas de homicidios femeninos a nivel mundial.
Según datos de la Cancillería de Honduras, Estados Unidos ha deportado en lo que va del año más de 12 mil hondureños (en Guatemala la cifra sería de 24 mil), sin embargo en la actualidad, México deporta más centroamericanos que Estados Unidos y es el lugar donde se encuentran las más grandes redes de tráfico y explotación de personas indocumentadas.
El Plan Frontera Sur llevado a cabo desde 2014 por Estados Unidos, otorga ayuda financiera a México para detener y repatriar a los migrantes de Centroamérica y en tan sólo un año de implementación, los índices de detención de ilegales en la frontera norteamericana descendieron un 58 por ciento.
Intermediario.Misma suerte corren aquellos que intentan llegar a Europa desde África o Medio Oriente. Ya sea por el tapón de Turquía o el Sudán y Libia, Europa al igual que Estados Unidos, ya no hace el trabajo sucio.
Primero, a cambio de 3 mil millones de euros, Europa cerró el corredor de los Balcanes, a través de un acuerdo terrible con la Turquía de Erdogan. Luego, con Libia, donde el gobierno italiano se desligó de sus responsabilidades sobre el Mediterráneo realizando un trato poco transparente con representantes libaneses acusados del comercio de personas y crímenes de guerra, un país al que no se le reconoce gobierno alguno.
Y por último Sudán, país que tiene un embargo de armas y cuyo Presidente de facto, Omar Al Bashir, tiene pedido de captura internacional. Pese a esto, la Unión Europa ha establecido un diálogo con varios países africanos en el llamado Proceso de Jartum (la capital de Sudán) y ha aportado cuantiosos fondos para la activación de un centro de contraterrorismo. La policía de Sudán, que es la encargada de patrullar las costas y luchar contra los traficantes de personas, recibe ayuda de la llamada Fuerza de Apoyo Rápido (RSF, por sus siglas en inglés), una delegación del Ejército sudanés formada por la milicia mercenaria Yanyauid, involucrada en ataques contra civiles en el conflicto de Darfur.
Los principales obstaculizadores del corredor a Libia, son los mismos que han sido acusados de traficar personas en el desierto, como lo expuso un informe de Human Rights Watch: una persona puede ser vendida como esclavo por 300 dólares.
La UE con Angela Merkel y Emmanuel Macron como resistencia, atacada por Estados Unidos por fuera y los xenófobos por dentro, deberá jugarse en dos partidas (la reunión del Consejo Europeo el 28 y 29 de junio y la Cumbre de la OTAN, el 11 y 12 de julio) no sólo el futuro escenario geopolítico de los próximos años, pero también un modelo de humanidad.

Title: Sudan: violence continues in Darfur region after peace talks open in Nigeria | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
With the Declaration of Principles on political issues already signed, the African Union (AU)-mediated talks were to focus on power-sharing, wealth-sharing and security arrangements with the goal of concluding a comprehensive peace agreement.
Meanwhile, UNMIS said it had received reports that armed tribesmen had killed three people in a village in north Darfur and that four women had been raped in south Darfur. In south Darfur, too, 20 men ambushed two trucks contracted by the UN, severely injuring one of the two drivers, it said.
Fighting broke out in Muslim Darfur, an arid western region of Sudan, in February 2003 when two rebel groups – the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) – rebelled against the Arab-led Khartoum government, claiming discrimination in the distribution of resources. The conflict, in which the Janjaweed Arab militia has terrorized the population, has claimed thousands of lives and displaced 2 million other people.

Title: Reporters Without Borders brands Lee Hsien Loong a "Predator of Press Freedom" » Singapore News
International press freedom advocate Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has branded Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as a “Predator of Press Freedom” on its official website.
The 62-year-old joins the likes of North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un, China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and The Taliban, amongothers, in being branded a “Predator of Press Freedom” by RSF.
In an infographic that accompanied the public branding, RSF highlighted that Lee is the son of Singapore’s founding PM, the late Lee Kuan Yew. It also asserted that Lee’s “attack technique” is “recurrent gagging” and outlined his “kill tally,” “enforcers,” and “favourite targets”.

Here is the full text from RSF, in case you cannot read the above:
The Singapore Government has always had an unsavoury relationship with RSF. Singapore has continuously been ranked poorly in the World Press Freedom Index that has been published by the RSF since 2002.
As it pointed out in the Lee infographic, RSF ranked Singapore at 154th spot in the Index in 2016. The Republic dropped one notch from the 153rd place it held in 2015, and 14 spots from the 140th place it occupied a decade ago, in 2006. RSFexplained the rankingfor Singapore as such:
Clashes between the France-based non-profit and high-ranking members of the Singapore Government are fairly common.
In 2005, former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who had, at that time, newly vacated his seat as head of Government, criticised RSF and said during the 5th Anniversary Dinner of TODAY newspaper:
Four years later, in 2009, current Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam spoke at the Opening Cocktail Reception of the Seasonal Meeting of the New York State Bar Association, International Section, where he whacked RSF.
Noting that Singapore ranked below Guinea – a West African nation that killed its own citizens for holding a peaceful pro-democracy rally – Shanmugam said:
In 2014, RSF fired back and criticised PM Lee for initiating a libel suit against blogger Roy Ngerng. Two years later, in 2016, the advocacy group criticised Shanmugam for allegedly treating local blog The Online Citizen unfairly over their coverage of the Benjamin Lim suicide case.
Then last year in Parliament, Shanmugan again rapped RSF for their press freedom rankings and urged Singaporeans to be “discerning” about such rankings that place Singapore behind nations like Pakistan and Afghanistan:
More recently, during the Select Committee hearings earlier this year on deliberate online falsehoods, RSF declined an invitation from the Government to present their views on “fake news” and said that it would present its views once it sees a draft of policy from the committee.
Citing doubt over the sincerity of the invitation and highlighting the “draconian laws” that curtail press freedom, RSF asserted that the possibly impending anti-fake news bill must not tighten the nation’s gag on dissent.
The committee responded by issuing apress releasestating that a top RSF representative waffled on taking the Singapore Government up on its invitation to give oral evidence at the hearings. The committee concluded that the invitation remains open to RSF.

South Sudan’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Mawien Makol (Photo: Citizen News)The foreign affairs ministry spokesperson, Mawien Makol said its embassy in Egypt is engaging Libyan authorities to establish facts after it was reported that at least nine South Sudanese were killed during the air raid that took place in Tajoura detention centre in Tripoli.
“We have received reports that South Sudanese were among people killed in Libya. We want to find out exactly how many (South Sudanese migrants) were there and the number of those probably killed,” he toldXinhuaThursday.
According to the United Nations, the detention centre in Tripoli was holding some 600 migrants at the time when the attack happened.
At least 53 migrants, it said, died and 130 were hurt in the air strikes.
The North African country has been torn by violence and division ever since its long time former President Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011.

Title: Sudan Revolutionary Front remains ‘committed to peace’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF, a coalition of Sudanese armed movements) has renewed its commitment to search for a peaceful solution for the crisis in Sudan. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council (SLM-TC) faction has officially joined the coalition.The SRF, currently chaired by Minni Minawi, leader of the SLM-MM, said in a statement on Saturday that the group remains committed to “peace as a strategic option to reach a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of the crisis in Sudan [..] and leads to democratic transformation and national reconciliation”.
The Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF, a coalition of Sudanese armed movements) has renewed its commitment to search for a peaceful solution for the crisis in Sudan. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council (SLM-TC) faction has officially joined the coalition.
The SRF, currently chaired by Minni Minawi, leader of the SLM-MM, said in a statement on Saturday that the group remains committed to “peace as a strategic option to reach a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of the crisis in Sudan [..] and leads to democratic transformation and national reconciliation”.
The statement, issued at the end of a number of meetings of the SRF Leadership Council in Paris last week, further said that the rebel groups are striving for a comprehensive political solution based on the AU roadmap. They will continue to work under the umbrella of the Sudan Call, an alliance of opposition parties and civil society organisations.
However, the allied rebel movements asserted their adherence to the armed struggle as a legitimate means for opposing the Khartoum regime.
The SRF called on “all Sudanese opposition forces [..] to guide efforts to bring about change and end the suffering of the homeland and the people”.
The coalition also confirmed its full support to the International Criminal Court (ICC), and called for the implementation ofarrest warrants issued by the courtfor President Omar Al Bashir, state governors Ahmed Haroun and Abdelrahim Hussein, and janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb.
The members of the SRF also welcomed the joining of the SLM-TC, currently led by Dr El Hadi Idris.
The new member however refuses to negotiate with the Sudanese government. The SLM-TC remains committed to its plans to overthrow the regime in order to build a stable Sudan,Idris toldSudan Tribune. The SRF is not a party to the AU roadmap, he said. It was signed by each of its members, not by the coalition as such.
Armed struggle, peace talks
The SRF was establishedin November 11, 2011, by the leaders of the four main armed movements in the country: the Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW), the SLM-MM faction, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N).
They declared at the time that they would overthrow the regime of the National Congress Party (NCP) “using all available means”. Two small opposition groups headed by Nasreldin El Hadi El Mahdi and El Tom Hajo became member in 2012. The following year, the eastern Sudanese United People’s Front for Liberation and Justice (UPFLJ), led by Zeinab Kabbashi, joined the coalition.
The SLM-AW withdrew from the SRF, when the coalition opted for a peaceful solution. Its founder and leader Abdelwahid El Nur sayshe will only join peace negotiationsafter Khartoum has restored stability and security in Darfur.
The SRF members agreed on the Sudan Call (also referred to as Sudan Appeal), a two-page political communiqué calling for regime-change and democracy, together with representatives of the National Umma Party, the National Consensus Forces (NCF, a coalition of opposition parties), and the Civil Society Initiative. It was signedin Addis Ababa on December 3, 2014. Other Sudanese opposition groups and parties joined the alliance in the following year.
The members of the Sudan Call have met several times with the AU High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) to discuss the ways peace can be reached in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.
In an attempt to revive the repeatedly stalled peace negotiations with Khartoum, the AUHIP prepared a roadmap agreement in early 2016. It was signed by the representatives of the Sudanese government in March. The Sudan Call forces howeverinitially refused the document, butdid sign itmonths later,in August.
Rounds of separate peace talks followed between the Sudanese government and the SPLM-N concerning South Kordofan and Blue Nile, and between Khartoum and the Darfuri movements SLM-MM and JEM. Both tracks however failed to reach an agreement.
In July this year,a German initiativeto invite the warring parties for “informal consultations”failed as well.

Title: Top 3 Recent Genocides and Their Sweeping Consequences - The Borgen Project
Genocide has been a part of the human experience for as long as humans have been around. As the world looks forward to solving issues like poverty and disease, recent genocides still threaten the developing world.
One of the most recent genocides happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Genocide Watch reports that genocide continues to take place. Moreover, a report by the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights states there has been evidence of recent genocides in the DRC as early as 1993.
Much of the recent genocide is involves two factions: the Raia Mutomboki militia, which seeks to kill or expel anyone speaking Rwandan or Congolese, and the rival Hutu militia called the FDLR, which attacks anyone associated with the Raia Mutomboki. Both sides have slaughtered civilians and combatants along ethnic grounds in hopes of annihilating their rival ethnic groups from the greater Congo area.
Considered the bloodiest conflict since World War II, reports estimate that almost six million people have died sincefighting started in 1996. Poverty, famine, disease and sexual violence continue to devastate the DRC. In 2010, a U.N. representative called the DRC the rape capital of the world. Additionally, civil unrest stemming from the postponement of the 2016 presidential elections displaced approximately 3.9 million people by the end of 2017.
Humanitarian organizations have provided aid, but the problems within the DRC are far from fixed. The International Rescue Committee expects to reach 8.4 million Congolese by 2020, focusing on improving the health and safety of women, children and the vulnerable.
Darfur is a region in Western Sudan witha populationof around seven million people. Since 2003, the Sudanese government-backed militia called the Janjaweed have laid waste to many villages in Darfur. The violence and recent genocide began as a series of reprisals for a 2003 attack on a Sudanese Air Force Base, and it was claimed that the residents of Darfur were responsible for the attack. The Janjaweed target civilians, committing mass murder and rape and looting economic resources. The U.N. estimates 4.7 million people have been affected by the fighting since 2004–half of them children. A 2016 report indicated that more than600,000 peoplehave died directly or indirectly because of the conflict.
Humanitarian accesshas been historically restricted and inhibited by the Sudanese government. The Sudanese government has been accused of intimidating and arresting aid workers. For example, in May 2005, two aid workers from Médecins sans Frontières were arrested at gunpoint under suspicion of “publishing false information” after a report by the organization was released on rape in Darfur.
Most of the world’s Yazidi’s live in the Sinjar province of northern Iraq and have practiced their distinct traditions for thousands of years. However, the Yazidis are a religious and ethnic minority publiclyreviled by ISIS. As a result, in August 2014, ISIS launched a genocide on the Yazidi communities of Sinjar. The ISIS fighters surged through the region, finding little military resistance. The local Peshmerga, a Kurdish security force, quickly abandoned their checkpoints and the Yazidi communities who depended on them for defense. The defenseless Yazidi villages offered little in the way of a military objective, so ISIS entered the region with one goal: the total extermination and subjugation of the Yazidi population. According to U.N. reports, Yazidi girls and women, as young as nine years old, were sold into sex slavery and trafficked across the Syrian border. Men and young boys were separated from their families–the men executed and the boys forced into ISIS training camps. Hundreds were summarily executed upon capture. All evidence points to an intentional and highly organized scheme by ISIS to end the Yazidi presence in Iraq, and potentially the world.
Access to the Sinjar region has been difficult for both humanitarian organizations and displaced Yazidis trying to return to their homeland. However, the Yazidis are not alone. Nadia’s Initiative, an advocacy organization founded by Nadia Murad, a 24-year-old Yazidi woman and survivor of the genocide, has gathered support for the Yazidi people by releasing a recent report on the current status of Sinjar. It has generated a unified humanitarian effort through the Sinjar Action Fund and has partnered with the French government to de-mine the explosives left behind by ISIS fighters in the region.
In the horrific wake of recent genocides, it can be easy to lose hope that genocide will be eradicated. However, organizations like the Sinjar Action Fund and the International Rescue Committee have and continue to work to produce a world without genocide. As solutions are being presented, it is up to everyone to implement them.

July 5, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The African Union and Ethiopian mediators, in the early hours of Friday, announced an agreement between the opposition and military junta that would lead to the formation of a transitional authority of three years and three months.
The Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) have reached agreement on all the disputed issues especially the Transitional Sovereign Council, which was the main sticking point.
The collegial body will consist of eleven members five from each side. Both, they have to agree on an independent civilian who will be the eleventh member. Also, the TMC will chair the Sovereign Council for 21 months followed by the FFC for 18 months.
The parties agreed to set up an independent committee with the support of the African Union to investigate the bloody the attack on the pro-democracy sit-in in Khartoum on June 3, 2019.
As expected, the composition of the parliament was postponed for three months for more consultations before to establish it. The parties maintained the agreed rates of 67% for the FFC and 33% for the rest of the other forces that participated in the revolution without being part of the broad coalition.
Also, the FFC will form a government of qualified technocrats that will implement economic and political reforms and prepare for the general elections in 2022.
Immediately, after the announcement of the deal, celebrations took place on the streets of the capital and thousands of people of all ages took to the streets and chanted their slogan for a civilian-led authority “Civilian! Civilian! Civilian! ”
The opposition and military leaders hailed the sacrifices made by the Sudanese people to achieve peaceful change in Sudan and the ouster of the former regime.
They, also, pledged to implement what was agreed upon and to establish democratic rule in the country.
FFC negotiator and Sudanese Congress Party leader Omer al-Digair, who was the first to take the floor after the AU envoy hailed the struggle of Sudanese people for change and stressed that the most important priorities of the transitional government to achieve peace and to carry out a transparent independent investigation on the “killers of the martyrs”.
“After 30 years of dictatorial rule, the Sudanese have proven the long-established historical truth that freedom and dignity do not die, (in their country)” he said. “Through a brave revolutionary movement, they managed to break the restrictions and open doors to the lights of freedom.”
For his part, the TMC deputy head, Mohamed d Hamdan Daglo (Hemetti) vowed that the change will be comprehensive and does not exclude anyone to achieve all the hopes and aspirations of the Sudanese people and its victorious revolution.
He also hailed the regional and international efforts that accompanied Sudanese to reach this agreement and expressed hope to achieve the agreement and to establish a democratic rule in Sudan.
The agreement is expected to be signed on Monday 8 July in the presence of the Ethiopian prime minister, the head of the African Commission and a number of regional leaders.

Title: Darfur agricultural season ‘catastrophic failure’ - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
Displaced people in Darfur have warned for the failure of the current agricultural season in the region because of the high cost of preparation.
Hussein Abusharati, the spokesman for the Darfur Association of Displaced People and Refugees described in an interview with Radio Dabanga the situation as catastrophic.
He explained that there is a rise in the cost of renting of a feddan, ploughing and seeds.
He said that most of the people in Darfur have moved to farming during the current season.
Abusharati expected the prices to rise in the event the agricultural season fails next year and called on the United Nations and the organisations concerned with nutrition to act so as to save the agricultural season, this as well as calling on the government to support the agricultural season from donor’s funds for the development of Darfur.
He also called on the farmers to be diligent in farming during the current season despite obstacles and difficulties.
RSF warning
Meanwhile, the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia in Darfur, Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), warned that his militiamen would be on guard and would arrest the outlaws after motorcycles and weapons have reappeared again in areas of the region.
He also called on the voluntary returnees to their areas that their return this time should be real rather than for farming during the rainy season only.
He also called on the relevant parties to be sincere in what they have promised to provide.
