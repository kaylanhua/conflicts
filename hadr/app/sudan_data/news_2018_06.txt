Title: Darfur rebels claim repelling military attack in Jebel Marra - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Armed rebels in Darfur announced that their forces clashed with Rapid Support Forces of the Sudanese government in northern Jebel Marra yesterday morning. They claimed that the militias shelled four villages.
Armed rebels in Darfur announced that their forces clashed with Rapid Support Forces of the Sudanese government in northern Jebel Marra yesterday morning. They claimed that the militias shelled four villages.
The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) under the command of Abdelwahid El Nur “repelled a a new attack launched by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the rebels’ sites at Buli and Aja in northern Jebel Marra on Thursday morning”, according to spokesman Walid Mohamed Abakar.
Abakar claimed that the battle resulted in the killing of 79 RSF troops that arrived from Kabkabiya, as well as the destruction of nine Land Cruisers and seizing various weapons.
“The RSF shelled four villages during their withdrawal: Keila North and South, Biraka Tousi and Hillet Sofi,” the spokesman told Radio Dabanga. “These attacks led to the displacement of a large number of residents into the mountains and caves.”
Shelling during clashes between government and rebel forces caused the death of six people and many others wounded in western and southern Jebel Marratwo weeks ago.
Spokesmen of the RSF or Sudanese army often refrain from commenting on military operations, however, last week the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the SLM-AW of carrying out isolated provocative attacks in Jebel Marra in Darfur to force the armed forces to respond militarily.
Countries such as the USA, UK, and Norway, have condemnedthe ongoing clashes between the SLM-AW rebels and Sudan’s army and militias.
In early March, the Sudanese army and allied militias began to attack various areas in the mountainous Jebel Marra region, in an attempt to eliminate the last strongholds of El Nur’s rebel group. Since this time,at least 50,000 people fled the fightingandmilitia attacks on their villages

Title: Saudi Arabia, UAE announce $3 billion aid for Sudan - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
King Salman of Saudi Arabia (AP file photo)April 21, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Sunday announced a joint initiative to provide $3 billion in assistance to Sudan.
According to the Saudi state news agency SPA, the grant includes a $500 million deposit into Sudan’s central bank to strengthen the country’s monetary reserves.
The rest of the assistance bundle will be in the form of food, medicine, and petroleum products.
Large protests that started on 19 December 2018 have led to the ouster of former President Omer al-Bashir and a Transitional Military Council (TMC) has taken over power on 11 April.
The resentment over the government’s inability to address fundamental economic issues has helped fuel the protests.
Sudan lost 75% of its oil reserves after the southern part of the country became an independent nation in July 2011, denying the north billions of dollars in revenues. Oil revenue constituted more than half of Sudan’s revenue and 90 percent of its exports.
The withdrawal of South Sudan oil has compounded the difficult external environment, including debt arrears, limited access to external financing, U.S. sanctions, and the withdrawal of correspondent bank relations.
The country’s inflation rate reached 73 per cent in December.
The most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report indicated that Sudan’s gross international reserves remained very low in 2017 ($1.1 billion, 1¾ months of imports).

Title: Sudan opposition calls for swift deal over power transfer - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Transitional Military Council leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan (SUNA photo)May 11, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudan’s opposition Freedom and Change forces denounced the slow pace of talks over the transitional authority and called for a swift agreement with the military council.
The military council and the opposition groups failed to reach a deal on the power transfer as the army insists that they should oversee Sudan’s transition and have the upper hand on the process despite regional and international pressures.
The council last week rejected a constitutional document drafted by the freedom and change groups and threatened they would hold early election in Sudan.
In a statement released Saturday, the opposition forces said they received a call from the military to resume discussions.
“We have informed them that the old approach is not consistent with the demands of the Sudanese people for salvation and to lead the revolution for its goals as quickly as required,” said the opposition coalition in a statement on Saturday.
The statement said they decided to send a written response, they have determined the stumbling points on which they want decisive talks, and to conclude discussions within 72 hours no more.
The opposition also decided to continue popular protests and escalate pressure on the military council saying they are the “only guarantee for achieving the objectives of the revolution”.
The forces of the Freedom and Change Declaration had to hold a press conference Saturday to develop their strategy for the upcoming period but they cancelled it saying it would be held ulteriorly without details.
Mohamed Nagi al-Asam, the Sudanese Professionals Association spokesperson and the iconic leader of 19 December Revolution on Friday said in a discussion with some sit-inners they have decided to escalate protests against the military council until reaching civil disobedience to force them to leave.
However, he disapproved calls for the formation of a revolutionary government for the time being saying that these measures would for armed confrontation with the military, a matter they are keen to avoid.

Title: RSF accuse le Soudan de saisir des tirages de plusieurs journaux
Print
Des agents du service de sécurité soudanais ont saisi cette semaine des tirages entiers de trois quotidiens, a annoncé jeudi Reporters sans Frontières (RSF), qui dénonce une nouvelle tentative pour "baîllonner" la presse au Soudan.
Les agents du Service national de renseignement et de sécurité (NISS) ont confisqué des tirages des quotidiens Al-Tayar, Alyoum Altaly et Al-Jareeda et ont interrogé des journalistes qui avaient couvert "des questions sensibles", a indiqué dans un communiqué RSF, une organisation de défense de la liberté de la presse.
Selon un communiqué de RSF, les tirages d'Al-Tayar des 10 et 11 juin ont été entièrement saisis à la suite de la publication par ce journal d'un article selon lequel une démission du président soudanais Omar el-Béchir pourrait contribuer à relancer l'économie du Soudan, actuellement en crise.

​
La journaliste d'Al-Tayar Shamael al-Nur, qui avait écrit cet article, a déclaré à RSF qu'elle avait ensuite été interrogée à 2 reprises par des agents du NISS. "Ils m'ont rappelé qu'il y a des lignes rouges et que le président en fait partie", a-t-elle rapporté.
Des agents du NISS ont aussi saisi mercredi des exemplaires du quotidien Alyoum Altaly, quelques jours après avoir empêché Al-Jareeda de distribuer son tirage à Khartoum, toujours selon RSF.
"La survie d'une presse libre au Soudan est en jeu", a déclaré dans le communiqué Arnaud Froger, chef du département Afrique de RSF.
"Le NISS doit cesser d'agir comme une police de l'édition qui censure les journalistes et réprime systématiquement toute publication critique, établissant des listes de sujets tabous comme cela lui convient", a ajouté Arnaud Froger.
En janvier, lors d'une vague de répression identique, des agents de la sécurité soudanaise avaient saisi des exemplaires de plusieurs journaux qui avaient critiqué le gouvernement sur la forte augmentation des prix du pain.
Les médias soudanais sont souvent ciblés par les agents du NISS, particulièrement lorsqu'ils publient des articles critiquant des décisions du gouvernement.
RSF a classé le Soudan au 174e rang sur 180 pays dans son index mondial de la liberté de la presse pour 2017. Le NISS "pourchasse les journalistes et censure la presse écrite", écrivait RSF à cette occasion.

Title: Parliament hearing on Central Darfur camp attack: “Situation stable” - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Sudan’s Minister of Interior informed the parliament about the “stable” security situation in Khamsa Dagayig camp in Central Darfur, where a woman was deadly shot by paramilitary gunmen on May 21.
Sudan’s Minister of Interior informed the parliament about the “stable” security situation in Khamsa Dagayig camp in Central Darfur, where a woman was deadly shot by paramilitary gunmen on May 21.
Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud spoke in the National Parliament in response to an urgent question about the events in the camp, on Thursday. Members of Parliament Siham Hasan of the Liberation and Justice Party and Mohamed Idris of the Sudan Liberation Movement-Second Revolution had posed the question about the camp for displaced people in Zalingei locality nearly less than month ago.
Khamsa Dagayig is one of the largest camps in Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur. It is close to the camps El Hamidiya and Hasahisa. According to the minister, people in these camps have “unwillingly faced the presence of government forces and in particular, police forces.”
Minister Mahmoud said that the three camps have become a refuge for outlaws and criminals. “The displaced people have been affected by this situation because the criminals who commit crimes are not being subjected to the hands of justice.”
In addition, Khamsa Dagayig “lacks urban planning that would ease movement within the camp”.
Minister Mahmoud: “People threw rocks at the paramilitary members, leading them to fire shots into the air.”
Meanwhile Mahmoud gave an account of the incident that happened in the camp on May 21. A group of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), driving five vehicles, had lost their way and entered a road that lead to Khamsa Dagayig camp. A number of people started throwing stones at the force.
According to Mahmoud the RSF troops could not pull out and some of the members started firing shots into the air to disband the gathered people. The bullets hit a woman in the crowd. This subsequently sparked anger among camp residents, and a group of them marched to Zalingei town to protest the violence in front of the secretariat of the state government.
Police then intervened to disperse the demonstrators. Mahmoud said that six people and six policemen were wounded, along with damage to two police vehicles. The police had recorded only the death of the woman who died five days after being treated in Khartoum hospital.
Radio Dabanga reported thedeath of 22-year-old Magboula Hasabelnabi, and the wounding of her child of 17 months old, the next day: May 22.
Investigation
Minister Mahmoud said that the state governor and the state security committee have formed a fact-finding mission under resolution 55-2018, headed by the deputy-high prosecutor.
“From initial testimony this committee could conclude that, after the interrogation of witnesses to the incident in the camp, and an inspection of the road where the RSF entered through, the RSF had gone down the road, entered the camp, where displaced people gathered to close the road and threw stones and logs at them.
“Some reported hearing gunfire to disperse the crowd.”
The minister reported that police were the first to arrive at the scene. “They were helping camp residents to return life in Khamsa Dagayig to normal, tried to contain the events and arresting rioters. […] The presence of troops within the camp is important to maintain security.”
He claimed: “The incident in the camp was sudden, as some had exploited the situation of the troop’s entry.”
Mahmoud added in his speech to parliament that his ministry fully supports the process to secure areas in Darfur for the voluntary return of displaced Darfuris.

Clashes between Sudan’s army and militias and the rebel forces are ongoing in the southern and western parts of Jebel Marra in Darfur. Six civilians were killed. The fighting has led people to flee to the higher mountains and caves for security.
Clashes between Sudan’s army and militias and the rebel forces are ongoing in the southern and western parts of Jebel Marra in Darfur. Six civilians were killed. The fighting has led people to flee to the higher mountains and caves for security.

Title: Survivor of Darfur violence comes to Harvard with a mission in mind — Harvard Gazette
A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts.
“My people are not educated. What I want to do is to help them go to school and study to try to protect our country,” says Harvard Extension School student Guy Adam, who survived the violence in Darfur.

Jonathan Harounoff
Harvard Correspondent
AUTHOR’S NOTE: My first encounter with Guy, or Abdelhamid Yousif Ismail Adam, was at a function organized by the Harvard Hillel in mid-April. We talked and I was both shocked and mesmerized by his life story. The next day I met with Guy at Harvard Kennedy School, where I interviewed him for the first of three times. I wanted to write this not just to demonstrate the sheer diversity of Harvard’s student body, but also to bring to light violence that, despite no longer dominating news headlines, continues to rage on.
In order to survive the slaughter in Darfur, it was the promise of education — the bedrock of democracy and freedom — Abdelhamid Yousif Ismail Adam clung to throughout his turbulent youth.
U.N. Security Council estimates show that more than2.7 million Darfuris have been displacedover the past 18 years. Many Sudanese have fled to neighboring countries — war-torn — to escape the violence and instability of their own.
Adam, who said he changed his name to Guy Josif Adam to honor the people who helped him, is currently studying international human rights law at Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education. This is his story.
For Guy (who prefers to use his first name), a birthday celebration is a novel phenomenon. According to his Sudanese passport, his journey “from nowhere to somewhere,” as he puts it, began on Jan. 1, 1986. Yet he does not know the exact date of his birth and believes he is 24 to 26 years old. “TheFurtribe does not keep dates as Western cultures do,” he explained during our first meeting at the Kennedy School.
Sipping a cup of steaming vanilla coffee, Guy began weaving from his painful childhood to the present day in a meticulous, almost rehearsed fluency that made me certain this was not his first interview. His advice to Google “Guy Josif Adam Darfur” if I encountered any biographical questions confirmed this suspicion.
For bureaucratic and official documentation, most in Sudan follow a similar procedure. “If you ask most people in Sudan” Guy jokes, “they will tell you they were born on January 1. It would seem like an amazing coincidence that in the city of Darfur, with over 9 million inhabitants, almost everyone was born on the same day.”
Guy was born in the village of Mara. His parents were farmers who tended livestock and cultivated crops to provide for their seven children. His schooling ended in the fourth grade because his father could no longer afford the tuition fees, and needed Guy to help support the family by working in the fields.
Life in Mara changed forever in the summer of 2003when 200 members of the government-backedJanjaweed— Arabic for “devils on horseback” — attacked the agrarian village of 2,000. TheJanjaweed,rebranded as the Rapid Support Forces in 2013, were notorious for their indiscriminate violence, and werecondemned by Human Rights Watch in 2004for inflicting “a campaign of forcible displacement, murder, pillage, and rape on hundreds of thousands of civilians.” While no longer commanding headlines, Darfur continues to be the scene of horrific ethnic violence orchestrated by the regime in Khartoum and Arab militias like theJanjaweed.
As members of Darfur’s predominant non-ArabFurtribe, considered ethnically inferior by the ruling National Congress Party and theJanjaweed, Guy and his family were targeted and savagely beaten.
“We were drinking tea,” Guy said. “My younger brothers were playing with our goats and scattering seeds to the doves in the yard when I suddenly heard gunshots. Several men appeared on horseback and began burning my family’s home.”
The men brandished Kalashnikovs, and Guy instantly knew they were members of theJanjaweed. “There was no time to say anything to anyone in my family. I was only thinking about how to get out of there.”
The image of aJanjaweedmilitant standing over his unconscious father, clenching a sharp wooden stick, would be Guy’s final memory of his home.
Fleeing his village with a broken arm and bloodied leg, Guy had no plan. As dusk approached, his chances of surviving the treacherous terrain dwindled. “As I was walking, I saw a car approaching. It was a medium-sized van with blue and white labels on the side.” Officials from the United Nations, who were posted at a nearby village, found Guy, wounded and distressed, and took him with them to Khartoum.
Living with Joseph, a British U.N. official in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, Guy grew proficient in English and enrolled at the local Young Men’s Christian Association. It was Joseph’s altruism and the intimate rapport he developed with a local pastor named Guy, that prompted Abdelhamid Yousif Ismail to convert from Islam to Christianity and change his name. (Neither Joseph nor the pastor’s last names were disclosed as a protective measure.)
“I had seen what people in Sudan had done in the name of Islam,” Guy said. “Killing is a crime and is never justified by the Quran. I no longer trusted the Islamic religion and felt that I could no longer be a part of it.”
But Khartoum was far from a permanent safe haven, since apostasy there is a crime punishable by death. His close contact with U.N. official Joseph had fueled rumors that Guy was leaking information about theJanjaweed’satrocities in Darfur to the wider international community.
Arrested and brutally tortured on three on occasions by National Congress Party (NCP) operatives, Guy was given a week to flee Sudan or be killed. During one detention, Guy said “they kicked me in the head,” leaving a protruding dent at the far-left corner of his forehead, and “stomped on me and spat on me. One interrogator used my body as an ashtray and burnt me on my arm with his cigarette. I spent a couple of hours standing alone in a cell. There were metal spikes coming out of the walls of the cell that prevented me from moving. I saw other prisoners who were hanging by their arms above their heads being pulled by rope.”
Escaping Sudan via Egypt and then Israel is a common but perilous route. This February, Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority reported thatmore than 15,400 people had fled from Sudan and sought asylum in the Jewish statebetween 2009 and 2017.
Guy’s dream refuge in Israel stemmed from his belief that the Jewish people and Darfuris had both been victims of intolerance, conflict, and violence. “I knew nothing about Judaism or Israel until I started learning from the people at the U.N.,” he said. “Israel’s origin story with the Holocaust and all the Jewish people’s suffering resonated with me deeply after seeing my people’s suffering in Darfur.”

Of the 23 men with whom Guy escaped Sudan, on the eve of the first night of Ramadan, only 10 made it across the border unscathed. The rest were either shot by Egyptian border police or caught and tortured by Bedouin smugglers, who prey on Sudanese and Eritrean escapees for lucrative organ harvesting.
“I took off my shoes and tied them to my waist”, Guy said, eyes clinched. “I saw a hole in the fence that I assumed had been made by people trying to cross the border before me. I started running straight toward the hole in the fence. The guy in front of me hit a trip wire. Immediately we heard gunshots being fired at us from the right side. I kept on running.”
On the Israeli side of the border, Guy spent a month at a refugee camp in the Negev Desert before being granted atemporary license(an I.D. card used to identify Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel so they could gain employment). Guy then moved to Tel Aviv. It was there he chanced upon someone he thought had been massacred at the hands of theJanjaweed: his brother, Adam Yousif Adam.
“I was in shock when I saw my brother Adam again for the first time,” Guy said, grinning uncontrollably. “He had been shot while crossing the border from Egypt into Israel. I asked him about our family, but he said he did not know anything about them. We did not talk about theJanjaweedattack.”
After five years in Israel, studying at Levinsky College of Education, volunteering at the African Refugee Development Center (ARDC), and working as a dishwasher and cook at a popular Tel Aviv café, Guy set his sights on America. His dream of studying in the U.S. was realized when he was accepted to study political science and international law at the College of Lake County in Illinois, graduating May 2016.
Guy later applied to Harvard because he was drawn to the University’s legal studies program at the Extension School. He says he was also inspired by stories about Harvard’s diverse and multi-national student population and the respect extended to students such as Guy.
With a graduation goal of  2020, Guy continues to participate in humanitarian work supporting Darfuri refugees in Israel and the U.S., and he remains vocal about the humanitarian crimes perpetrated by the National Congress Party. He is currently the partnerships editor atThe Africa Policy Journal, a Harvard Kennedy Schoolstudent publication.
Guy says he dreams of harnessing his education to transform Darfur and the wider turbulent region. For him, the pursuit of education is a potent remedy to the Sudanese government’s brutalities and flagrant violations of human rights. “My people are not educated,” Guy said. “What I want to do is to help them go to school and study to try to protect our country. I believe that as human beings we are equal, whatever our color: black, white, pink, or blue.”
Jonathan Harounoff is a British graduate of the University of Cambridge where he studied Arabic, Persian, and Middle Eastern studies.

Des agents du service de sécurité soudanais ont saisi cette semaine des tirages entiers de trois quotidiens, a annoncé jeudi Reporters sans Frontières (RSF), qui dénonce une nouvelle tentative pour «bâillonner» la presse au Soudan.
Les agents du Service national de renseignement et de sécurité (NISS) ont confisqué des tirages des quotidiensAl-Tayar, Alyoum AltalyetAl-Jareedaet ont interrogé des journalistes qui avaient couvert «des questions sensibles», a indiqué dans un communiqué RSF, une organisation de défense de la liberté de la presse.
Selon un communiqué de RSF, les tirages d’Al-Tayardes 10 et 11 juin ont été entièrement saisis à la suite de la publication par ce journal d’un article selon lequel une démission du président soudanais Omar el-Béchir pourrait contribuer à relancer l’économie du Soudan, actuellement en crise.
La journaliste d’Al-TayarShamael al-Nur, qui avait écrit cet article, a déclaré à RSF qu’elle avait ensuite été interrogée par deux fois par des agents du NISS. «Ils m’ont rappelé qu’il y a des lignes rouges et que le président en fait partie», a-t-elle rapporté.
Des agents du NISS ont aussi saisi mercredi des exemplaires du quotidienAlyoum Altaly, quelques jours après avoir empêché Al-Jareeda de distribuer son tirage à Khartoum, toujours selon RSF.
«La survie d’une presse libre au Soudan est en jeu», a déclaré dans le communiqué Arnaud Froger, chef du département Afrique de RSF.
«Le NISS doit cesser d’agir comme une police de l’édition qui censure les journalistes et réprime systématiquement toute publication critique, établissant des listes de sujets tabous comme cela lui convient», a ajouté Arnaud Froger.
En janvier, lors d’une vague de répression identique, des agents de la sécurité soudanaise avaient saisi des exemplaires de plusieurs journaux qui avaient critiqué le gouvernement sur la forte augmentation des prix du pain.
Les médias soudanais sont souvent ciblés par les agents du NISS, particulièrement lorsqu’ils publient des articles critiquant des décisions du gouvernement.
RSF a classé le Soudan au 174e rang sur 180 pays dans son index mondial de la liberté de la presse pour 2017. Le NISS «pourchasse les journalistes et censure la presse écrite», écrivait RSF à cette occasion.

Title: From Darfur to Chad – The Moderate Voice

From theBBC:

The violence in Chad could turn into a genocide similar to that in Rwanda in 1994, the UN refugee agency has warned.The UNHCR says the killing tactics from neighbouring Darfur in Sudan have been transported to eastern Chad in full.
The U.N. and the A.U. seem confident that a joint “border peace force” will be established, but:

Concern is now growing for the 200,000 refugees who sought shelter in eastern Chad.The conflict in Darfur has followed them across the border with attacks by Janjaweed Arab militia on camels and horseback leaving hundreds dead and 110,000 people homeless.
I don’t know nearly enough about the situation in Chad, but now might be a good time to educate ourselves. Thankfully, the BBC has a good deal of background, including acountry profile, atimeline, aQ&Aon andresultsof last May’s presidential election (which I also wrote about at the time — seehere), apieceon the rebel alliance, and anexaminationof Chad in relation to its neighbours. In addition, seethis pieceandthis pieceon last year’s battles between rebels and government forces, as well asthis pieceon the situation in the eastern part of the country, next to Darfur.
See a map of the “conflict zones” on the border with Darfur, with an explanation of how and where the violence is spreading,here.
See also photos of the Janjaweed in Chadhereand of the aftermath of battlehere.
Pay attention to this story.Genocide is spreading. Will we do anything about it now? Or will Chad, like Darfur, become yet another Rwanda?

Community leaders in eastern Sudan have renewed their demand for the abolition of the State of Emergency in southern Tokar in Red Sea state and in Kassala. They denounce the continuing attacks by government forces on civilians in the area.“People in southern Tokar are living under the State of Emergency for more than 15 years,” Abdallah Mousa, a native administration official told Radio Dabanga.“The State of Emergency has led to widespread abuses by the militiamen of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the area, as they are protected by this measure,” he said. “The authorities must intervene and halt the plundering by army and militia troops in southern Tokar.”KassalaMousa further downplayed government justifications for imposing the strong measure in Kassala in end December last year.“Six months after the imposition of the State of Emergency, we can say that the area was not attacked by Eritrea,” he stated. “Other justifications such as combating human trafficking and the smuggling of consumer goods have proven to be incorrect as well, as these crimes have not decreased until now.”Mousa called for the strengthening of state institutions such as the police and the army. “These forces should fight cross-border crimes instead of RSF militiamen who are only harassing and robbing the people in the area.”He said that the disruption by the militiamen of the border crossings with Eritrea and Ethiopia has led to stagnating the markets of Kassala, “which is negatively affecting the life of the people”.

Plural news and views on Sudan
Omer al-Bashir declares the state of emergency on 22 February 2019 (SUNA photo)May 2, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudan’s Attorney-General ordered to open a corruption investigation into ousted President Omer al-Bashir on allegations of money laundering and dealing with foreign exchange.
The  Attorney-General Waleed Sayed Ahmed Mahmoud al-Khamis ordered to interrogate al-Bashir Who was ousted on April 11 last “in accordance with criminal case No. 40/2019 under articles 6/1 of the Foreign Exchange Act and Article 15 of the  Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act.
On 25 April, Vice-President of the Transitional Military Council,  Mohamed Hamdan Daglo aka “Hemetti”, confirmed press reports that large amounts of money had been found in Al-Bashir accounts.
Al-Sudani newspaper had previously said that al-Bashir had 315 million Saudi riyals (about $ 85 million) in a commercial bank account in Khartoum and that the last movement of the account was in March 2016.
Hemetti indicated that in addition to the 315 million Saudi riyals, they found 142 million dollars, more than 800,000 Sudanese pounds.
Also, just before the figures were announced, more than 6 million euros, 351,000 dollars and 5 million Sudanese pounds (150,000 dollars) were found at Bashir’s residence in Khartoum.
Mahmoud also directed the ministry to start investigating the suspected financial transactions of former officials.
On Wednesday, the attorney general ordered the seizure of properties of some figures in the al-Bashir regime.
In his latest statement on Thursday, Hemetti pledged to try and hold accountable those who committed crimes against the Sudanese people by the symbols of the former regime.
He confirmed that the military junta has reached files related to the corruption of symbols will be decided soon.
Regarding the war crimes in Darfur and the two arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court, the military council said the matter will be decided by the government.

Regarding the war crimes in Darfur and the two arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court, the military council said the matter will be decided by the government.

Title: Sudan in new drive to 'gag' press freedom: watchdog | News24
Thursday, 29 August
15 Jun 2018
Sudanese security agents confiscated entire print-runs of three newspapers this week in what media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said on Thursday was a new drive to "gag" press freedom in the African nation.
Agents of Sudan's powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) confiscated copies of Al-Tayar, Alyoum Altaly and Al-Jareeda over the past few days and also interrogated some journalists for covering "sensitive issues," the media watchdog said in a statement.
RSF said the entire print-runs of Al-Tayar were seized on June 10 and 11 in the latest bid by NISS agents to "gag the press" after it published a column that said President Omar al-Bashir's resignation might help in reviving the country's ailing economy.
"They reminded me that there are red lines and that I should have known the president was one of them," Al-Tayar reporter Shamael al-Nur, who wrote the column on June 9, was quoted as saying by RSF after she was twice interrogated by NISS agents.
Security agents seized copies of Alyoum Altaly on Wednesday, just days after preventing Al-Jareeda from distributing its copies in Khartoum, RSF said.
"The NISS must stop operating as an editorial police that censors journalists and systematically suppresses any critical publication, listing taboo subjects as it pleases," head of RSF's Africa desk, Arnaud Froger, said in the statement.
"The survival of a free press in Sudan is at stake."
Security agents had seized copies of several newspapers in a similar crackdown in January after they criticised the government over soaring bread prices.
Media in Sudan are frequently targeted by NISS agents for their reporting, especially for publishing articles that criticise government policies.
RSF ranked Sudan 174th out of 180 countries on its 2017 world press freedom index, saying that NISS "hounds journalists and censors the print media".

Title: International press freedom watchdog condemns 'NISS offensive against critical journalists' in Sudan - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) issued a statement today condemning “another offensive against critical journalists and media outlets by Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)”.
International press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) issueda statement todaycondemning “another offensive against critical journalists and media outlets by Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)”.
The statement issued by RSF headquarters in Paris, France, refers to the seizure by the NISS in the past week of entire issues of three privately-owned dailies and interrogated two journalists for covering sensitive issues.
In their latest bid to gag the press, as reported by Radio Dabanga, NISS agents confiscated the entire print-run of thedailyEl Tayyaras it came off the press on two days running, on 10 and 11 June, in response to a column by reporter Shamail El Nur in the 9 June issue in which she said President Omar Al Bashir’s resignation would benefit Sudan’s economy. The NISS summoned her twice and questioned her closely. “They reminded me that there are red lines and that I should have known the president was one of them,” she told RSF.
On 13 June, NISS agents seizedEl Youm El Talinewspaper without reason. A week earlier, they already prevented the dailyEl Jareedafrom distributing that day’s issue until 11 a.m. and restricted its distribution to the capital, Khartoum. Forreportingthis action, Ahmed Younes, a correspondent for the London-based dailySharq Al Awsat, was arrested and interrogated by NISS agents for several hours on 7 June. Younes told RSF he was also questioned last month over an article aboutdivisions within the ruling partyand was given “strict orders not to cover certain subjects” on pain of losing his press accreditation and being imprisoned. “They talk about ‘red lines’ but they don’t tell us what they are and they vary according to the mood of the investigator at the time,” he said.
“The NISS must stop operating as an ‘editorial police’ that censors journalists and systematically suppresses any critical publication, listing taboo subjects as it pleases,” said Arnaud Froger, the head of RSF’s Africa desk. “The survival of a free press in Sudan is at stake.”
In February, RSF condemned awave of arrestsof journalists and confiscations of newspaper issues by the NISS that had begun the previous month. Issues of theEl JareedaandEl Watandailies were alsoseizedwithout reason on 5 and 6 May.
Sudan is ranked 174th out of 180 countries inRSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Africa (18 June 2018) - Central African Republic | ReliefWeb
CAR+ 7 more
Key developments in Africa on the week of June 10th include the prevailing tensions in CAR, the spread of ethnic violence in Ethiopia, the insurgencies in the Sudans, and the political disorder in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
In the Central African Republic (CAR), efforts to tackle insecurity in areas dominated by armed groups were reinforced last week as state forces started to be redeployed to Bangassou in Mbomou. However, these efforts were frustrated by an alleged attack on the Bangassou convoy at Bambari in Ouaka by elements of the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC) on June 10th. Clashes continued through the next day, leaving five UPC members killed. In a second incident in Bambari on June 10th, a MINUSCA peacekeeper died and another was severely injured when they came under attack by unknown armed elements between the town centre and the airfield.
In Ethiopia, tensions further increased in different areas of the country on the week of June 10th. In the Guji zone in southern Ethiopia, violence between the Guji and Gedeo groups continued unabated, with reports of over 200 people killed and 300,000 displaced in the most recent wave of violence that started on June 4th. In the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), tensions rose between ethnic groups who, although at odds over territory or administration issues, had seldom fought in the past. The Gurage and Kebena groups clashed in Welkite town between June 12th-15th. Around the same time, in Hawassa and Sodo, a cultural celebration ended in prolonged clashes between the Wolayeta and Sidama groups. In Oromia’s Chinaksen, the paramilitary Somali Liyu police was particularly violent, killing 14 Oromo citizens. The violence carried out by the force over the past few months has prompted groups like Amnesty International last week to call on the new administration to disband it.
In Sudan, heavy clashes occurred between government forces – including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudan Liberation Army – Abdul Wahid al-Nur faction (SLA-AW) over June 12th-14th in southern areas of Jebel Marrah in Darfur. Clashes have occurred between these parties since early March. SLA-AW claimed that over 100 were killed in the violence and that the RSF burned down villages in the area following their defeat. In South Sudan, clashes occurred around June 13th in the Bazia area of Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, between the government and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO). Military troops were said to have been moved to the area one month prior, while clashes between the two parties had not been reported in Wau since the end of January. The SPLA-IO accused the state forces of looting and burning down rebel-held villages in the area following the clashes. The clashes came amidst potentially destabilising moves, including the government’s ongoing important military reshuffles and the rival efforts carried out by neighbouring Sudan and Ethiopia to advance the peace process.
There were several other significant developments. In Uganda, tensions have been running high over a spate of murders and kidnappings over which the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) and the opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) have traded blame. The apparent assassination of NRM lawyer Abiriga and his brother in Kampala on June 8th led to riots in their home constituency in Arua, with residents asking if the government is still able to guarantee their safety. President Museveni blamed the opposition and launched a series of measures to restrict them. A number of high-profile arrests were already made last week, such as former police chief Kayihura and opposition MP Nambooze; new regulations on boda drivers – part of an informal community policing structure loyal to Kayihura – were also announced. In Zimbabwe, inter-party tensions are persisting as the country approaches the July elections. In addition to attacking supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (Tsvangirai Faction) (MDC-T), supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union‐Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) attacked defectors from the ruling party. On June 8th and 9th, there were two fatal incidents involving the child of a ZANU-PF supporter who defected to the National People’s Party (NPP) in Glendale (Mashonaland Central) and former ZANU-PF supporters now in the National Patriotic Front (NPF) in Kwekwe (Midlands).
Further north, in Nigeria, state forces continued their operations to clear Boko Haram from the Lake Chad region in conjunction with Cameroonian troops. At the same time, Boko Haram militants led multiple suicide attacks in Maiduguri targeting police and officers from the Civilian Joint Task Force. And in Libya, militiamen led by Ibrahim Jadhran attacked the oil basin in central Libya and took control of the oil port of Sidra and Ras Lanuf following clashes with the Libyan forces.

Press statement by 55 Sudanese lawyers and Human rights defenders on Sudan Sit-in and Peaceful Protest
Khartoum -24/04/2019
We, the undersigned (55) Sudanese lawyers and human rights defenders, congratulate the people of Sudan on their great landmark December-April revolution and we send our prayers to the souls of all Sudan martyrs and victims of war and those who lost their lives while peacefully protesting and perusing a peaceful and democratic Sudan and those whom we lost, as a result of the miserable laws and policies of Sudan Salvation regime since June 30th 1989.
As lawyers, we would like to stress the importance of Sudan’s commitment to its international and regional obligations particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the Republic of Sudan since 1986 – mainly article 19 and article 20; and Sudan’s commitment to its people, peace and security as stated in the African Charters for Humans and People Rights. All instruments grant the citizens’ rights to peaceful association and freedom of expression and opinions.We as Sudanese lawyers here by, stress the rights of Sudanese people to peaceful protests and their freedom of expression and the legitimacy of their demands for civil government based on their declared and clearly stipulated consciences reflected in the “Declaration of Freedom and Change”.
We the undersigned lawyers and Human rights defenders stress that the peaceful Sit-In does not by any means threaten any peace or security and we commend the wisdom and commitment of Sudanese peaceful protesters in keeping the peace whilst maintaining the nonviolent nature of their protest and demands.Equally, we emphasize that the only way to avoid violence and unlawful acts is to ensure the rights and the protection to peaceful protest.
We call on Sudan Military Council, Sudan Legal and Law enforcement institutions, the national army, regional actors and the international community to respect the Human Rights of Sudanese people and take their just demands for civil government seriously and with utmost high regard, and ensure their protection while they are exercising their civil duty and peacefully serving and working for the future of their country.
Equally, we are calling on the peaceful protestors in the Sit-in in Khartoum and beyond to continue exercising their freedom of expression and their right of peaceful assembly while maintaining public safety, public order, the protection of public health and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This is the only guarantee for a civil and democratic state that respects the rule of law and responds to the hopes and aspirations of Sudanese people who have endured the suffering and agony of conflicts and injustice for almost 30 years.

SPLM-N’s Yasir Arma (C) and Ismal Jalab (L) pose with TMC Chams al-Din Kabbashi (2 L) and Yasir al-Atta (R) on 30 May 2019 (Photo SPLM-N Agar).jpegMay 30, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The Transitional Military Council (TMC) Thursday held a meeting with the deputy leader of the SPLM-N Agar, ending controversy after demanding him to quit the country.
Yasir Arman and Ismail Jalab the Movement’s Secretary General arrived in Khartoum on 26 May despite a death sentence against over his alleged role in a rebellion in the Blue Nile by the former regime in 2014.
His return was welcomed by the political forces and was seen a positive step towards ending the armed conflicts as it would encourage the other groups to follow his example.
But on Tuesday Arman disclosed that he had received several calls asking from the head of the TMC and his deputy urging him to leave the country.
In a surprising statement on Thursday, the SPLM-N Agar said that Arman and Jalab were received by Shams al-Din Kabbashi TMC Spokesperson and Yasir al-Atta of the political committee at the Sudanese presidency.
“The meeting was frank and open and dealt with the current political situation, issues of just peace and ending wars forever,” said the statement.
“The two sides agreed that the issue of war and the achievement of peace is one of the most important issues of transitional arrangements and the climate of revolution and change must be used to achieve peace,” further stressed the statement.
The statement did not mention the TMC demand to leave the country or threats to arrest him.
In another separate statement, Arman said the death sentence against the Movement’s leader and his person was a politically motivated sentence that ended with the removal of the former regime.
“The meeting we have, me and my colleagues, with the political committee of the Transitional Military Meeting has put an end to this issue,” he stressed.
He further said the meeting provided a good opportunity to discuss the major issues of peace, ending wars and comprehensive transitional arrangements.
The threats against Arman were condemned by the political forces and foreign diplomats in Khartoum. Also, British parliamentarians and several foreign officials criticized the military council for this “unwise” decision.
Arman who is also the Sudan Call’s external relations official before to return to Khartoum said he would seek to make peace on the top of the agenda of the transitional period and to promote social justice and equal citizenship in Sudan.
