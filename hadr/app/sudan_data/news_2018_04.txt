Title: Sudan Militia Demands EU Payment for Blocking African Migrants
(Bloomberg) -- A Sudanese government militia accused of human-rights abuses said it deserves European Union compensation for guarding the border with Libya to prevent African migrants from reaching the Mediterranean.
The commander of the Rapid Support Forces, which has its roots in so-called “janjaweed” militias implicated in war crimes in Sudan’s western Darfur region, said thousands of its fighters are blocking migrants seeking a path to Europe. The EU has pledged over 100 million euros ($123 million) since 2016 for Sudan projects to address the cause of “irregular migration,” butsays Sudan’s governmentdoesn’t get any direct financial support nor does the RSF benefit.
“We do the job instead of the EU,” RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan told a graduation ceremony for his fighters Thursday in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. “That’s why they should recognize our efforts and support us as we lost a lot of men, efforts and money -- otherwise we will change our minds from carrying out this duty.”
Sudan, ruled by President Umar al-Bashir, is a transit point for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa countries including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia as they try to reach Europe. Alongside those escaping war in Syria, they have formed part of Europe’s biggest wave of people fleeing their home countries since World War II.
The RSF, previously deployed by Sudan’s security agency to fight rebels in areas including Darfur and Southern Kordofan, has been accused by the U.S. and New York-based Human Rights Watch oftargeting civiliansand looting in those territories, charges Sudanese authorities deny.

Title: 292 political detainees still in Sudan prisons: activists - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
A long list of political detainees from Darfur has been published. Activists claim that they were not included in the presidential order to release all political detainees in Sudan because of their allegiance to the detained Sheikh Musa Hilal.
A long list of political detainees from Darfur has been published. Activists claim that they were not included in the presidential order to release all political detainees in Sudan because of their allegiance to the detained Sheikh Musa Hilal.
The list of 292 Darfuri detainees, prepared by activists, has been released online. Most of the detainees were arrested in North Darfur, days before and after the arrest of Sheikh Musa Hilal on November 26.
Names, locations and dates of detention are included on the list. Detainees include Haroun Mahmuod Meddekheir, Adam Ramadan Jarelnabi, Yousif Ibrahim Bakhit and Ismael El Aghbash.
In a written statement the wife of El Aghbash has appealed to human rights experts in Sudan and to the United Nations’ independent expert on human rights to Sudan, to intervene and release her husband and the other detainees.
Currently hundreds of Darfuris are still being held in detention by the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) despite the order of President Omar Al Bashir to release all political detainees from the country’s prisons last week.
Kober prison in Khartoum and Port Sudan prison still hold 61 detainees of the Maaliya tribe, who have been there for more than nine months. Also in detention are seven students who are member of a pro-rebel student movement; they were arrested after organising speeches at Khartoum Bahri market last year.
Musa Hilal
In November 2017, Darfur leader Musa Hilal, former janjaweed leader and chairman of the Revolutionary Awakening Council, wasarrested during an ambushin the Mesteriya area, along with his sons, brothers, and entourage, by elements of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia and was subsequently transferred to Khartoum. Hilalhad refused to cooperatewith the government’s campaign of disarmament and arms collection.
Last week one of the mediators between Hilal and the Sudanese government was kidnapped in Omdurman to an unknown destination. The mediator had reportedly received threats to stay away from Hilal.

Title: Commander of Sudan’s main militia wants international recognition - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, has called on the international community to recognise the efforts of his troops to halt illegal immigration, human trafficking and cross border crimes.The official Sudanese News Agency (SUNA) reported on Thursday that RSF commander Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti) called on the international community to lift Sudan’s name from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism.
The commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, has called on the international community to recognise the efforts of his troops to halt illegal immigration, human trafficking and cross border crimes.
The official Sudanese News Agency (SUNA)reported on Thursdaythat RSF commander Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti) called on the international community to lift Sudan's name from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism.
Addressing 2,650 new RSF graduates at the War College in Khartoum on Thursday, Hamdan referred to the major role the regular forces and the RSF are playing to prevent the smuggling of migrants and goods to neighbouring countries.
The commander renewed RSF’s commitment to the directives of President Omar Al Bashir to defend Saudi Arabia, “the land of the two holy shrines”, and the Gulf states, in addition to Sudan’s participation in the Arab Coalition Forces “to restore legality in the sisterly Yemen”.
He emphasised that the RSF “reject all sabotage and negative acts that harm the people and the homeland”.
He further announced his support to the president's efforts concerning thecomprehensive reform processthat is taking place in the country, and expressed his rejection of all forms ofeconomic sabotage.
Funding
It is not the first time that the militia commander calls for international recognition.In September 2016, he blamed the European Union for not thanking the RSF for their efforts to halt human trafficking from Sudan to Libya “on behalf of Europe”.
In April 2016, the EU announced it would provide about € 100 million toaddress irregular migrationand improve living conditions of refugees and host communities in eastern Sudan. About € 40 million from the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa would be earmarked for a programme to bettermanage migrationin the region.
End that year, the European Commission approved a € 170 million package of 11 new actions under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to improve stability and address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement in the Horn of Africa region.
The USA-based activist organisationEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU’s financial support to Sudan in mitigating and combating illegal migration would assist the RSF – whichthe EU denied.
According to Human Rights Watch investigations in 2015, the RSF are accountable forwidespread systematic crimesagainst civilians, constituting “egregious crimes” against humanity and war crimes. Most atrocities were part of a widely announced government offensive against armed rebels in Darfur: jointly with the Sudan Air Force, RSF troops repeatedly attacked villages. More recently, the RSF are wreaking havoc andassaulting and robbing peoplein the area of Jebel Marra.
A community leader in eastern Sudan’s Kassala complained in March this year about “the killings and attacks” carried out by RSF troops against the people in the state. He told Radio Dabanga that the militiamen “have turned into a real nightmare provoking panic and fear by harassing the residents on the pretext of commodity smuggling.”

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online

Mousa Mohamed Saleh(72)reportedly diedthis weekendafter severe torture by members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia,inSouth Darfur’sEastJebel Marra.
A relative of the victim told Radio Dabanga that a group of RSF militiamen in two Land Cruisers and a vehicle belonging to the Military Intelligence intercepted Saleh while he was grazing his cattle, together with his sons, near Rokona village on Saturday morning.
“They questioned him about rebel commanders in the area. When he denied knowing anything about them, they beat him severely and poured hot water on him in front of his sons and grandsons,” he said. “They then took him to El Malam.”
The relative explained that the RSF took his body to Mershing on Sunday, where they forced his family to accept the body.
The killing of Saleh occurred days after thedeath of Sheikh Mousa Simbi (80), in a similar incident at the Libei government forces' base in East Jebel Marra.
End March and early April, government forces attacked the areas of Sawani, Rokona, and Libei in East Jebel Marra. The areas are the last strongholds of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW).
The area of Libei is now accommodatingmore than 50,000 displaced who have fled the military confrontationsandmilitia attacks on their villages.
Activists told this station earlier that the villagers are still living in the open or hiding in caves after theirvillages burned to the ground.
TheUN Independent Expert on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan, Aristide Nononsi, arrived in Khartoum on Sunday for a 10-day visit to the country.

Title: Sudan airlifts hundreds of Darfuri recruits to UAE bound for Yemen war - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Last week hundreds of Darfuris were reportedly transported from El Geneina airport in West Darfur to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in two large aircraft, for military training. They will then be deployed by Sudan in the war in Yemen.
Last week hundreds of Darfuris were reportedly transported from El Geneina airport in West Darfur to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in two large aircraft, for military training. They will then be deployed by Sudan in the war in Yemen.
Informed sources in El Geneina told Radio Dabanga that the recruitment process is carried out by officers of the UAE.
According to the sources, each recruit who is fit to fight and is no more than 30 years old would be given SDG1 million (*$55,000) in advance to sign a service contract for a period of five years.
The sources said that last week two large aircraft loaded with hundreds of soldiers of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia were flown to Yemen after receiving military training in camps in West and Central Darfur.
Hundreds of recruits have already been flown from Nyala airport to Saudi Arabia after being recruited by Saudi officers at Mural Hotel.
The recruits were reportedly each handed an initial advance payment of SDG 830,000 ($45,700) before travelling to Saudi Arabia where they would be trained for military service.
The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) faction headed by Malik Agar said that the RSF have sent a force to Blue Nile State. They have begun recruiting in South Kordofan's Nuba Mountains as well.
Yesterday the movement appealed in a statement “to the Sudanese and the people of the Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile) to organise a broad campaign to reject the recruitment of the people of these regions into the RSF, reject the deployment of these forces there, and to decisively confront the plunder of the resources for the interest of the regime.”
Yemen conflict
There have been demands from within Sudan and abroad to withdraw Sudanese troops from the war in Yemen, especially following reports thaton 10 April three senior Sudanese officers and dozens of soldiers were killed during a battle in northern Yemen, in the desert of Medi. Dozens more soldiers were wounded.
Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour, confirmed after meeting with ambassadors of the Arab coalition countries in Yemen (Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt), continued participation in the coalition forces and support of the efforts to restore stability in Yemen.
The ambassadors conveyed their condolences to the families of the fallen, and their wishes for healing the wounded of the recent operations in Yemen.
Minister of Defence Ali Salim told MPs in a closed session during which he presented his Ministry's statement on the country's security situation in Parliament that “This is not the first time for the Sudanese forces to participate in a war outside the country. He justified that participation as natural.

The Rapid Support Forces, Sudan’s main militia, foiled an attempt to smuggle people to Libya on Saturday. The European Union is “quietly getting its hands dirty [..] by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records,” says the New York Times.The head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) in North Darfur told the press on Saturday that members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) intercepted two Land Cruisers in Wadi Howar that were on their way to the Sudanese-Libyan border.
The Rapid Support Forces,Sudan’s main militia,foiled an attempt to smuggle people to Libya on Saturday.The European Union is “quietly getting its hands dirty [..] by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records,” says the New York Times.
The head of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) in North Darfur told the press on Saturday that members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) interceptedtwo Land Cruisers in Wadi Howar that were on their way to the Sudanese-Libyan border.
Apart from the smugglers, the vehicles carried 66 migrants: Six Ethiopians and 37 Sudanese. There were eight women and seven children among them.
The Governor of North Darfur, Abdelwahed Yousef, added that security agents recently managed to arrest eight human trafficking gangs in the state.
Transit country
According to the UN refugee agency, Sudan is one of the main transit countries for eastern Africans who want to travel to Europe by sea.
In April 2016, the EU announced it would provide about € 100 million toaddress irregular migrationand improve living conditions of refugees and host communities in eastern Sudan. About € 40 million from the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa would be earmarked for a programme to bettermanage migrationin the region.
End that year, the European Commission approved a € 170 million package of 11 new actions under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa to improve stability and address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement in the Horn of Africa region.
'The approach is working,' says correspondent Patrick Kingsley. 'But many migration advocates say the moral cost is high.'
‘Border management’
The USA-based activist organisationEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU’s financial support to Sudan in mitigating and combating illegal migration would assist the RSF – whichthe EU denied.
On Sunday, theNew York Times onlinepointed as well to the EU “quietly getting its hands dirty [..] by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records.
“In practical terms, the approach is working: The number of migrants arriving in Europe has more than halved since 2016. But many migration advocates say the moral cost is high,” the author, Patrick Kingsley, stated.
Though Europe continues to enforce an arms embargo against the country, the relationship between the EU and Sudan “is unmistakably deepening”. The EU has even agreed that Khartoum will act as a nerve centre for counter-smuggling collaboration.
The evolving relationship could mean that European leaders are implicitly reliant on a Sudanese security apparatus whose leaders have been accused by the UN of committingwar crimes in Darfur,” the article reads.
European officials have direct contact only with the Sudanese immigration police, and not with the RSF militia or the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). “But their operations are not that far removed.”
Calls for recognition
Earlier this month,Radio Dabanga reported that the commander of RSF, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti) wantedthe international community to recognisethe efforts of his troops to halt human trafficking.In September 2016, he blamed the EU for not thanking the RSF for their efforts to halt human trafficking from Sudan to Libya “on behalf of Europe”.

In the areas of Jawa, Seena, Feina, Dawa Sawani and Rakoona at least 23 civilians were killed and tens seriously injured, 12 villages were set on fire and burnt to the ground
From 9 March – 2 April 2018, the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) has documented a number of attacks perpetrated against civilian targets in East Jebel Marra in South Darfur state by the Sudanese Armed Forces, Rapid Support Forces and other government sponsored militias. The attacks took place in the villages of: Feina, Dalo, Dawa , Dolda , Libei, Sawani, Rakoona, Fouli, Duwa, and Kidineer. At least 15,000 civilians have been displaced to the neighbouring mountains in each area. In the areas of Jawa, Seena, Feina, Dawa Sawani and Rakoona at least 23 civilians were killed and tens seriously injured, 12 villages were set on fire and burnt to the ground. The attacks were precipitated by fighting in Eastern Jebel Marra between the government forces and the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid (SLA-AW).

ACJPS calls on the Government of Sudan to immediately put in place measures to protect civilians in Jebel Marra, South Darfur State and respect customary international law obligations regarding internal armed conflicts which prohibit deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians even where there may be armed elements amongst civilians, attacks aimed at terrorizing civilians, and attacks against civilian objects. The principle of distinction between civilians and combatants – that is people taking an active part in hostilities – prohibits the targeting of civilians in all circumstances.
ACJPS condemns all arbitrary attacks on civilians and calls on the Government of Sudan to cease attacks in civilian areas and:

ACJPS also calls on UNAMID to fulfil its mandate to contribute to the protection of civilian populations under imminent threat of physical violence, and prevent attacks against civilians within its capability and areas of deployment. UNAMID’s capacity is already threatened by a significant upcoming drawdown in its military and police officers.
ACJPS calls on the international community, particularly the European Union, United States, and African Union, to publicly and privately press the Sudanese government to meet its legal obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, and end deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, torture, rape and looting. The Sudanese government should ensure unfettered access by UNAMID peacekeepers and humanitarian actors to all parts of Darfur including those most affected by conflict.
Attacks inJawa, south of Deribat
On 9 March 2018, three civilians were injured during fighting between government forces and SLA-AW in the area of Jawa, south of Deribat, in East Jebel Marra. They include:

The three were transferred to Rakoona, west of Jawa, for medical treatment.
Attacks inSeena area South East of Jebel Marra
On the afternoon of 22 March 2018, fighting was renewed in the Seena area, South East of Jebel Marra between the government forces and the SLA -AW. As a result 4 civilians were killed. They include:

Attacks in East Jebel Marra
On 28 March 2018, the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces backed by the government sponsored militia attacked scores of houses in the villages of  Feina, Dalo, Dawa, Dolda , Libei, Sawani, Rabkona, Fouli, Duwa,  and Kidineer in East Jebel Marra.
During the attack, at least 3 civilians were killed and 12 others were injured.  The 12 injured were taken to a medical facility in Feina to receive treatment. ACJPS was able to obtain details of six of the 12 injured persons. They include:

The names of the deceased are:

That same day,28 March 2018, at least two people were seriously wounded when a bomb hit their house in the Sawani area in East Jebel Marra. They were taken to a medical facility in Sawani to receive medical attention. Their names are:

On the morning of 31 March 2018, members of the RSF, traveling in more than 20 vehicles and tens of motorcycles, backed by the government sponsored militia riding camels and horses, attacked villages in the area of Sawani and Rakoona. During the attack, at least 16 people were killed in Sawani and livestock was looted in both Sawani and Rakoona. ACJPS also received information that a number of people sustained injuries during the attack. ACJPS was able to obtain the names of the 16 deceased persons. They are:

On the morning of 2 April 2018, at least two men were killed by the RSF in Rakoona, near Debo Alomda in East Jebel Marra. Their names are:

Background
In 2015 the UN Panel of Experts on Sudan characterized the Government strategy in Darfur as one of “collective punishment” and “induced or forced displacement” of communities from which the armed opposition groups are believed to come or operate. The majority of civilians in Jebel Marra are from the Fur ethnic group, who have been particularly targeted by the Sudanese government since the outbreak of the conflict in 2003.
Initially a paramilitary group, the RSF now functions as a regular force of the Government of Sudan following the passage of the 2016 Rapid Support Forces Act, which integrates the RSF into the Armed Forces of the country, and provides for the commander of the RSF to be appointed by the President.
The RSF has led a number of brutal counterinsurgency campaigns, supported by aerial bombardment, against civilian populations since their creation in mid-2013. In January 2016, ACJPS documented the RSF’s involvement in the burning and looting of the nearby village of Mouli, approximately 15 kilometers south of El Geneina, on 9 and 10 January 2016.
ACJPS also documented a number of attacks on civilian villages between 28 May-15 June 2017 in Central and North Darfur. In late June and early July 2017, ACJPS documented a continuing trend of targeted attacks on civilians in Central and North Darfur. The attacks on civilians appear to have been prompted by the earlier clashes between Government and armed opposition forces, and intended to punish or otherwise intimidate civilians living in the areas of rebel activity.

Title: Sudan Blocks Migrants’ Path, Aiding Europe
ABU JAMAL, Sudan — At Sudan’s eastern border, Lt. Samih Omar led two patrol cars slowly over the rutted desert, past a cow’s carcass, before halting on the unmarked 2,000-mile route that thousands of East Africans follow each year in trying to reach the Mediterranean, and then onward to Europe.
ABU JAMAL, Sudan — At Sudan’s eastern border, Lt. Samih Omar led two patrol cars slowly over the rutted desert, past a cow’s carcass, before halting on the unmarked 2,000-mile route that thousands of East Africans follow each year in trying to reach the Mediterranean, and then onward to Europe.
His patrols along this border with Eritrea are helping Sudan crack down on one of the busiest passages on the European migration trail. Yet Omar is no simple border agent. He works for Sudan’s feared secret police, whose leaders are accused of war crimes — and, more recently, whose officers have been accused of torturing migrants.
Indirectly, he is also working for the interests of the European Union.
“Sometimes,” Omar said, “I feel this is Europe’s southern border.”
Three years ago, when a historic tide of migrants poured into Europe, many leaders there reacted with open arms and high-minded idealism. But with the migration crisis having fueled angry populism and political upheaval across the Continent, the European Union is quietly getting its hands dirty, stanching the human flow, in part, by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records.
In practical terms, the approach is working: The number of migrants arriving in Europe has more than halved since 2016. But many migration advocates say the moral cost is high.
To shut off the sea route to Greece, the European Union is paying billions of euros to a Turkish government that is dismantling its democracy. In Libya, Italy is accused of bribing some of the same militiamen who have long profited from the European smuggling trade — many of whom are also accused of war crimes.
In Sudan, crossed by migrants trying to reach Libya, the relationship is more opaque but rooted in mutual need: The Europeans want closed borders and the Sudanese want to end years of isolation from the West. Europe continues to enforce an arms embargo against Sudan, and many Sudanese leaders are international pariahs, accused of committing war crimes during a civil war in Darfur, a region in western Sudan.
But the relationship is unmistakably deepening. A recent dialogue, named the Khartoum Process (in honor of Sudan’s capital) has become a platform for at least 20 international migration conferences between EU officials and their counterparts from several African countries, including Sudan. The European Union has also agreed that Khartoum will act as a nerve center for countersmuggling collaboration.
While no European money has been given directly to any Sudanese government body, the bloc has funneled 106 million euros — or about $131 million — into the country through independent charities and aid agencies, mainly for food, health and sanitation programs for migrants, and for training programs for local officials.
“While we engage on some areas for the sake of the Sudanese people, we still have a sanction regime in place,” said Catherine Ray, a spokeswoman for the European Union, referring to an embargo on arms and related material.
“We are not encouraging Sudan to curb migration, but to manage migration in a safe and dignified way,” Ray added.
Ahmed Salim, director of one of the nongovernmental groups that receives European funding, said the bloc was motivated by both self-interest and a desire to improve the situation in Sudan.
“They don’t want migrants to cross the Mediterranean to Europe,” said Salim, who heads the European and African Center for Research, Training and Development.
But, he said, the money his organization receives means better services for asylum-seekers in Sudan. “You have to admit that the European countries want to do something to protect migrants here,” he said.
Critics argue the evolving relationship means that European leaders are implicitly reliant on — and complicit in the reputational rehabilitation of — a Sudanese security apparatus whose leaders have been accused by the United Nations of committing war crimes in Darfur.
“There is no direct money exchanging hands,” said Suliman Baldo, author of a research paper about Europe’s migration partnership with Sudan. “But the EU basically legitimizes an abusive force.”
On the border near Abu Jamal, Omar and several members of his patrol are from the wing of the Sudanese security forces headed by Salah Abdallah Gosh, one of several Sudanese officials accused of orchestrating attacks on civilians in Darfur.
Elsewhere, the border is protected by the Rapid Support Forces, a division of the Sudanese military that was formed from the janjaweed militias who led attacks on civilians in the Darfur conflict. The focus of the group, known as RSF, is not counter-smuggling — but roughly a quarter of the people-smugglers caught in January and February this year on the Eritrean border were apprehended by the RSF, Omar said.
European officials have direct contact only with Sudanese immigration police, and not with the RSF, or the security forces that Omar works for, known as NISS. But their operations are not that far removed.
The planned countertrafficking coordination center in Khartoum — staffed jointly by police officers from Sudan and several European countries, including Britain, France and Italy — will partly rely on information sourced by NISS, according to the head of the immigration police department, Gen. Awad Elneil Dhia. The regular police also get occasional support from the RSF on countertrafficking operations in border areas, Dhia said.
“They have their presence there and they can help,” Dhia said. “The police is not everywhere, and we cannot cover everywhere.”
Yet Sudanese police are operating in one unexpected place: Europe.
In a bid to deter future migrants, at least three European countries — Belgium, France and Italy — have allowed in Sudanese police officers to hasten the deportation of Sudanese asylum-seekers, Dhia said.
Nominally, their official role is simply to identify their citizens. But the officers have been allowed to interrogate some deportation candidates without being monitored by European officials with the language skills to understand what was being said.
More than 50 Sudanese seeking asylum in Europe have been deported in the past 18 months from Belgium, France and Italy; The New York Times interviewed seven of them on a recent visit to Sudan.
Four said they had been tortured on their return to Sudan — allegations denied by Dhia. One man was a Darfuri political dissident deported in late 2017 from France to Khartoum, where he said he was detained on arrival by NISS agents.
Over the next 10 days, he said he was given electric shocks, punched and beaten with metal pipes. At one point the dissident, who asked that his name be withheld for his safety, lost consciousness and had to be taken to the hospital. He was later released on a form of parole.
The dissident said that, before his deportation from France, Sudanese police officers had threatened him as French officers stood nearby. “I said to the French police: ‘They are going to kill us,'” he said. “But they didn’t understand.”
European officials argue that establishing Khartoum as a base for collaboration on fighting human smuggling can only improve the Sudanese security forces. The Regional Operational Center in Khartoum, set to open this year, will enable delegates from several European and African countries to share intelligence and coordinate operations against smugglers across North Africa.
But potential pitfalls are evident from past collaborations. In 2016, British and Italian police, crediting a joint operation with their Sudanese counterparts, announced the arrest of “one of the world’s most wanted people smugglers.” They said he was an Eritrean called Medhanie Yehdego Mered, who had been captured in Sudan and extradited to Italy.
The case is now privately acknowledged by Western diplomats to have been one of mistaken identity. The prisoner turned out to be Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, an Eritrean refugee with the same first name as the actual smuggler. Mered remains at large.
Even Dhia now admits that Sudan extradited the wrong man — albeit one who, he says, admitted while in Sudanese custody to involvement in smuggling.
“There were two people, actually — two people with the same name,” Dhia said.
Berhe nevertheless remains on trial in Italy, accused of being Mered — and of being a smuggler. Beyond that, the Sudanese security services have long been accused of profiting from the smuggling trade. Following European pressure, the Sudanese parliament adopted a raft of anti-smuggling legislation in 2014, and the rules have since led to the prosecution of some officials over alleged involvement in the smuggling business.
But according to four smugglers whom I interviewed clandestinely during my trip to Sudan, the security services remain closely involved in the trade, with both NISS and RSF officials receiving part of the smuggling profits on most trips to southern Libya.
The head of the RSF, Brig. Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, has claimed in the past that his forces play a major role in impeding the route to Libya. But each smuggler — interviewed separately — said that the RSF was often the main organizer of the trips, often supplying camouflaged vehicles to ferry migrants through the desert.
After being handed over to Libyan militias in Kufra and Sabha, in southern Libya, many migrants are then systematically tortured and held for ransom — money that is later shared with the RSF, each smuggler said.
Rights activists have previously accused Sudanese officials of complicity in trafficking. In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said that senior Sudanese police officials had colluded in the smuggling of Eritreans.
A British journalist captured by the RSF in Darfur in 2016 said that he had been told by his captors that they were involved in smuggling people to Libya. “I asked specifically about how it works,” said the journalist, Phil Cox, a freelance filmmaker for Channel 4. “And they said we make sure the routes are open, and we talk with whoever’s commanding the next area.”
Dhia said that the problem did not extend beyond a few bad apples. Sudan, he said, remains an effective partner for Europe in the battle against irregular migration.
“We are not,” he said, “very far from your standards.”

Title: EU Reiterates It Won't Support Controversial Sudan Border Force
(Bloomberg) -- The European Union said its program in Sudan to tackle the causes of “irregular migration” doesn’t involve giving any funds to the North African nation’s government, nor will it ever support a controversial militia guarding the Libyan border.
“The EU does not want to stop migration, but to ensure it takes place in a safe and regular way,” a European Commission spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Our priority is to save lives, break the business model of smugglers and traffickers, address the root causes of migration and improve opportunities in countries of origin, while ensuring legal pathways to Europe.”
The EU said assistance to Sudan’s people is delivered by United Nations organizations, member states’ agencies and non-governmental organizations and the funds are “closely scrutinized” by its delegation to Sudan. “No support has ever been provided nor will it be provided to the Rapid Support Forces” and the EU doesn’t equip any other Sudanese border forces, it said.

Title: Sudan, UNISFA discuss security situation in Abyei - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
February 19, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Head of the Sudanese side of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC) Ahmed Al-Salih Saloha Monday has met with Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) General Gebre Adhana Woldezgu.
The meeting, which was held in Khartoum, has discussed the security situation in the contested region as well as the possibility of coordination between the two sides.
During the meeting, Saloha criticized UNISFA for obstructing a recent visit of AJOC to Abyei by force, saying Woldezgu has apologized for the action taken by his force.
For his part, Woldezgu expressed readiness to cooperate with the AJOC fully, saying UNISFA intends to launch development projects to serve the residents.
Ownership of Abyei, a border region disputed by Sudan and South Sudan, remained contentious after the world’s youngest nation split from Sudan in 2011.
There is no joint administration between Sudan and South Sudan, as the Ngok Dinka refuse the formation of Abyei Area Administration and the Legislative Council. Instead, they call to hold a referendum without the Sudanese pastoralist Misseriya.
Now there are two committees one for the Misseriya appointed by the Sudanese government and another for the Ngok Dinka appointed by Juba government.
On 27 June 2011, the Security Council, by its resolution 1990, responded to the urgent situation in Abyei by establishing the UNISFA.
UNISFA’s establishment came after Sudan’s government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) reached an agreement in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to demilitarise Abyei and let Ethiopian troops monitor the area.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) provides that the contested territory remains part of the north until the organisation of a referendum determines its fate.
The difference over who will participate in the referendum prevents the two countries from holding the agreed referendum.
However, the Dinka Ngok organised a unilateral referendum from 27to 29 October 2013 to say they want to join the Republic of South Sudan.
Khartoum, Juba, the African Union and the international community refused to recognise the outcome of the vote.

♦ RSF militia captures 66 migrants in North Darfur
April 23 – 2018 EL FASHER / NEW YORKThe Rapid Support Forces, Sudan’s main militia, foiled an attempt to smuggle people to Libya on Saturday. By outsourcing border management to countries with “dubious” human rights records, the European Union is “quietly getting its hands dirty”, says a New York Times author.
The head of the Sudanese security service (NISS) in North Darfur told the press on Saturday that members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) intercepted two Land Cruisers in Wadi Howar. They were on their way to the Sudanese-Libyan border and carried 66 refugees: six Ethiopians and 37 Sudanese people. There were eight women and seven children among them.
Last week, police in eastern Sudan raided places where 25 illegal immigrants, most of them from Eritrea, were being held hostage by a human trafficking gang. The immigrants have beentaken into custody.
The European Union has financially supported plans for better migration management in Sudan. The USA-based activist organisationEnough Projecthas warnedthat EU’s financial support would assist the RSF – reports whichthe EU denied.
On Sunday, theNew York Times onlinepointed as well to the EU outsourcing its border management to Sudan. “In practical terms, the approach is working: The number of migrants arriving in Europe has more than halved since 2016. But many migration advocates say the moral cost is high,” the author, Patrick Kingsley, stated.

♦ Sudan airlifts hundreds of Darfuri recruits to UAE, bound for Yemen
April 18 – 2018 DARFURLast week hundreds of Darfuris were reportedly transported from El Geneina airport in West Darfur to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in two large aircraft, for military training. They will then be deployed by Sudan in the war in Yemen.
Informed sources in El Geneina told Radio Dabanga that the recruitment process is carried out by officers of the UAE. According to the sources, each recruit who is fit to fight and is no more than 30 years old would be given SDG1 million ($55,000) in advance to sign a service contract for a period of five years.
The sources said that last week two large aircraft loaded with hundreds of soldiers of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia were flown to Yemen after receiving military training in camps in West and Central Darfur. Hundreds of recruits have already been flown from Nyala airport to Saudi Arabia after being recruited by Saudi officers at Mural Hotel.
There have been demands from within Sudan and abroad to withdraw Sudanese troops from the war in Yemen, especially following reports that on 10 Aprilthree senior Sudanese officers and dozens of soldiers were killedduring a battle in northern Yemen, in the desert of Medi. Dozens more soldiers were wounded.
Former Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour, who has beensacked by President Al Bashiron Thursday for discussing salaries of Sudanese diplomats in public, had recently confirmed Sudan’s continued participation in the Arab coalition forces in Yemen (Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt).

Title: Rebels claim killing of paramilitaries in Darfur’s Jebel Marra - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) under the command of Abdelwahid El Nur claimed a deadly attack on militiamen in the northwestern part of Jebel Marra on Monday.
The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) under the command of Abdelwahid El Nur claimed a deadly attack on militiamen in the northwestern part of Jebel Marra on Monday.
The rebels killed 11 members of the militiamen which they claim to be the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and wounded a number of others in the area of Wadai in Toro. They also claimed to have seized arms and ammunition from the RSF.
Waleed Mohamed Abakar, the military spokesman for the SLM-AW, told Radio Dabanga that members of the RSF arrived on camels and horses in Toro. The rebel forces responded and the ensuing fight lasted until 10a.m.
“Two of our troops were killed and five of us were wounded.” The fighting has led to hundreds of civilians fleeing the areas and taking refuge in the slopes of the surrounding mountains and caves, according to Abakar.
Torched
Abakar reported that the RSF torched the villages Kiti and Dargu, and set fire to the Kuri Koran School. The movement claimed that RSF members also set fire to houses in thirteen villages they plundered in northern Jebel Marra onThursday and Friday.
On Sunday, the rebel movement reported fierce fighting between its combatants and government forces in the area of Jaldo in northern Jebel Marra.
The SLM-AW denied claims by Sudan’s Arab Baath Party, which said that the militiamen burned the villages in retaliation, after some members of the SLM-AW killed camel herders and stole a number of camels from Tawa village on Wednesday.

Title: Sudan forces take control of rebel-held areas in Blue Nile - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), backed by army troops, attacked areas controlled by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) in Blue Nile State on Saturday. The rebel group condemned the violation of the ceasefire declared by President Omar Al Bashir.
The RSF, Sudan’s main militia, reported at its Facebook page on Sunday that it has regained control over the areas Goya El Jadida, Goya El Gadima, Kabadik, and Jiko.
The SPLM-N Blue Nile faction under the leadership of Malik Agar confirmed the attacks.
According to a statement by the SPLM-N chief of general staff, Ahmed El Omda, the RSF launched a 10-hour attack on rebel sites in the areas of Soda and Jaghab in Jebel Ban – which is an extension of the Ingessana Hills.
The movement claimed it managed to thwart the attacks in both areas.
The fighting resulted in the displacement of a large number of civilians, mostly elderly people, women and children, who took refuge in the mountains.
The SPLM-N called on the African Union, the United Nations, the Sudan Troika (USA, UK, and Norway), and other members of the international community to intervene and put a halt to the hostilities, condemn the violation of the ceasefire in Blue Nile, and hold the government accountable.
‘Massive offensive’
On Thursday, El Omda reported “a massive offensive” by the RSF against SPLM-N combatants in Blue Nile state.
In early January, President Al Bashir extended the government’s unilateral cessation of hostilities for three months. The SPLM-N Blue Nile faction unilaterally declared a six-month ceasefire on December 30, 2017.
After a period of relative peace since 2005, fighting between the SPLM-N and the government in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states (the Two Areas) erupted again in 2011.

Title: International Community should support South Sudan peace implementation - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
By Roger Alfred Yoron Modi
The latest South Sudan peace deal signed between the government of President Salva Kiir, various armed and unarmed opposition groups and other parties, including the SPLM/A-IO led by the former First Vice President Dr Riek Machar, is facing implementation challenges and at the centre of it, according to officials, is lack of funds.
The pact dubbed Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) was signed in September last year through the Igad-led revitalisation process of the 2015 Peace Agreement (known as ARCSS) which remains largely unimplemented due to the resumption of armed conflict in July 2016, barely three months after a unity government was formed then.
Now the R-ARCSS provides for the establishment of a “Revitalised Government of National Unity (RTGoNU)” whose term of office shall be thirty-six (36) months, commencing eight (8) months after signing of the R-ARCSS (as of September 12) or on completion of redeployment of “necessary unified forces.”
According to the R-ARCSS, Kiir shall continue as President of the Republic of South Sudan, and Dr Machar shall assume the position of the First Vice President of the Republic of South Sudan respectively.
In addition to the First Vice President, the R-ARCSS provides that there shall be four (04) Vice Presidents in the Republic of South Sudan, two of whom shall be nominated by the incumbent government and one each by the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) and the Former Detainees (FDs) respectively. The deal also provides for formation of a Five Hundred and fifty (550) member Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) to be shared among the parties: Incumbent TGoNU: three hundred and thirty two (332) members; SPLM/A-IO: one hundred and twenty eight (128) members; SSOA: fifty (50) members; OPP: thirty (30) members; FDs: ten (10) members.
Since gaining independence in 2011, South Sudan has been operating under a Transitional Constitution. Thus, in addition to implementing the R-ARCSS, one of the mandates of the RTGoNU is to oversee and ensure that a Permanent Constitution-making process is successfully carried out and completed before the end of the transitional period. The R-ARCSS provides that the Permanent Constitution shall establish a federal and democratic system of governance that “reflects the character of the Republic of South Sudan and ensures unity in diversity.”
The R-ARCSS stipulates that the RTGoNU shall hold elections sixty (60) days before the end of the Transitional Period in order to establish a democratically elected government. The Agreement, inter alia, contains provisions for various institutional and legal reforms.
–       Why the International Community should support the R-ARCSS
After the July 2016 clashes, the international community continued to support “implementation” of the ARCSS even when several factions pulled out of the ARCSS and declared it “dead”. Throughout, very little has been implemented, if any, from the ARCSS and war intensified.
Then now why is the international community showing little or no support to the R-ARCSS even when there is much more inclusivity, some progress and a higher momentum compared to those in the post-July 2016 ARCSS era? It is a more complex issue than it appears. For example, responding to me on the above question, one fellow said, “That ‘continuation’ of funding by the international community was premised on their earlier commitment. Now that South Sudanese failed them in the first attempt, the international community is not intent on BEING DIDDLED for the second time and take note that the decision of the international community is INFORMED by South Sudanese individuals/groups KNOWLEDGEABLE of the goings-on…”
Well, I differ with the respondent in his reply. I do not agree with him that the international community was diddled in the post-July 2016 funding of the ARCSS. This is because the writings were very clear that the ARCSS was not being implemented during and after the July 2016 clashes. The region and the international community had their members representing them in the ARCSS Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) and they continued to be part of JMEC and supportive of the same even when other parties to the Agreement pulled out or were exiled and declared that the deal had collapsed. From that time forward, the international community had the choice of pulling out from the Agreement when (if) they realised that they were being taken for a ride and that the ARCSS was not being implemented in letter and spirit. But they stayed in throughout. Anyway, if the international community had made a decisive move with respect to the status of the ARCSS, the situation in the Country would have been different: better or probably worse. But this is not a time for blame games. For it is good that the region and the international community spoke with one voice almost throughout the ARCSS revitalization process. As a result, now there is the R-ARCSS in place which is not so much different from the ARCSS, and, if implemented in letter and spirit, the R-ARCSS can lead to the same goal that the ARCSS was designed to achieve in the first place.
Substantively, there is no difference between the ARCSS and the R-ARCSS as far as the legal and institutional reforms stipulated in the two Agreements are concerned, save for the Permanent Ceasefire Arrangements provided for in the R-ARCSS, which again is a positive improvement if implemented.
One area that had raised concerns was Article 2.4.6 of the August 28th 2018 Initialled R-ARCSS which read, “The current monitoring and verification mechanism shall be restructured and reconstituted into the Ceasefire Transitional Security Arrangement, Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM). It shall be led by Sudan and Uganda.” That article was seen as giving Sudan and Uganda control over South Sudan.
That Article 2.4.6 was changed in the final version of the signed R-ARCSS and now the Article simply reads, “The current monitoring and verification mechanism shall be restructured and reconstituted into the Ceasefire Transitional Security Arrangement, Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM).”
The restructuring and reconstitution of the then monitoring and verification mechanism into the CTSAMVM have been done already, according to JMEC.
As per Article 2.4.8 of the R-ARCSS, the CTSAMVM Board membership shall comprise the representatives of:
·         Three each from the warring parties (3×3=9);
·         Former Detainees: one (1);
·         Other Political Parties: three (3);
·         Women’s bloc: one (1) and Other Women groups: one (1);
·         CSOs: two (2);
·         Youth: two (2);
·         Business Community: one (1);
·         Academia: one (1);
·         Eminent personalities: one (1);
·         IGAD: three (3);
·         AU: one (1);
·         China: one (1);
·         Troika (United States, United Kingdom, Norway): one (1);
·         UNMISS: one (1);
·         IPF: one (1);
·         EU: one (1);
Another area of the R-ARCSS that raised concerns was the signing and inclusion of the provision of the Khartoum Declaration on the protection of oil fields which the South Sudanese parties signed in June during the R-ARCSS revitalization process.
The R-ARCSS provides in its preamble that, the parties reaffirmed the commitments that they “have solemnly undertaken” in the Khartoum Declaration.
The Khartoum Declaration stipulates that the Government of South Sudan in collaboration with the Government of Sudan shall immediately rehabilitate the oil fields in Unity State (Blocks 1, 2, and 4) and Tharjiath (Block 5A), “and others as would be agreed upon, for the resumption and the restoration of the previous levels of oil production.”
Article 5 of the Declaration provides that “The security the oil fields in Unity State (Blocks 1, 2, and 4) and Tharjiath (Block 5A) is the responsibility of all South Sudan citizens. If need be, the Government of South Sudan, while undertaking its security duties, shall work in this regard in collaboration and coordination with the Government of Sudan…All the outstanding issues related to the oil sector, particularly on the cost of oil field rehabilitation, shall be technically assessed and economically valued by the relevant authorities of South Sudan and Sudan respectively…”
Those provisions did not go well with some South Sudanese and others. But is there really a need for alarm because of the abovementioned provisions? Maybe, but I do not see it.
It is also worth recalling that, it was the 32nd Extra-Ordinary Summit of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government that mandated President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir of Sudan to facilitate the Khartoum Talks to: “a. discuss and resolve the outstanding issues on governance and security arrangements including measures proposed in the (then) revised Bridging Proposal of the IGAD Council of Ministers; and b. discuss measures to be taken to rehabilitate the South Sudanese economy through bilateral cooperation between the Republic of South Sudan and the Republic of Sudan.” So here we are and the R-ARCSS was finally signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
It is also worth mentioning that only the United Nations, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and Igad Countries, as well as the South Sudanese parties that signed the R-ARCSS.
Unlike the ARCSS, this time, the TROIKA (USA, UK & Norway), the European Union, the Peoples Republic of China, the IGAD Partners Forum (IPF) and the African Union High Level Ad-hoc Committee for South Sudan (the Republic of Algeria, the Republic of Chad, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Republic of Rwanda, the Republic of South Africa) have all not signed the R-ARCSS. This shows an indirect lack of moral support to the peace deal, to say the least.
As per the R-ARCSS, just like in the ARCSS, several of the above-mentioned Countries have memberships in bodies (mechanisms) to be formed (reconstituted) for the implementation of the R-ARCSS and they could play their role there, in ensuring that the Agreement is implemented for peace and reforms in the Country. However, unfortunately, sources say some of those Countries have not sent their nominees for appointments by Igad into the Independent Boundaries Committee (IBC) for the resolution of the contentious issue of States number in South Sudan. Now, the IBC has not been announced officially as per schedule and this has negatively affected the implementation of the R-ARCSS. This should quickly be rectified for the implementation of the Agreement to move on smoothly.
Like I said, substantively, there is no difference between the ARCSS and the R-ARCSS as far as the legal and institutional reforms stipulated in the two Agreements are concerned, these include: the process of the Permanent Constitution-making; the reforms in the Judiciary and in several legislation such as the Public Finance Management and Accountability Act 2011; review of Petroleum Revenue Act 2012; The Mining Act 2012; Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2012; National Revenue Authority Act 2017; Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009; National Audit Chamber Act 2011; review of legislation on land to, inter alia, address issues of land grabbing; review of the Non-Governmental Organizations Act, 2016, to ensure that it complies with international best practice in regulating the activities of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in South Sudan; review of  Political Parties Act, 2012; The National Elections Act, 2012;  just to mention a few.
On the issue of funding, early this month, the UK special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan Amb. Christopher Trott reportedly called on the parties to the R-ARCSS to come up with a budget “so that necessary assistance can be accorded to them for implementation of the peace agreement.”
Amb. Trott, according to Eye Radio, reiterated his government’s readiness to support the peace process, but only if they begin to see real progress on the ground. This is a positive gesture.
On his part, while urging foreign donors to fund implementation of the R-ARCSS, South Sudan deputy foreign minister Deng Dau Deng on Wednesday announced the government’s contribution of about $1.4 million for the peace implementation. That is a positive move from the government of South Sudan but the amount is far too small compared with the $114 million budget prepared for activities of the pre-transitional period. According to South Sudan minister of Cabinet Affairs, also Secretary of the National Pre-Transitional Committee (NPTC), Dr Martin Elia Lumoro the $114 million budget will be used to facilitate the work of the peace committees and implement security mechanisms.
It is indeed paramount that the South Sudanese parties lead the way in the implementation of the Agreement, as they expect support from the region and the international community.
As the UN Refugee Agency Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Amb. Mohamed Abdi Affey said in October last year, South Sudan will end up empty if the R-ARCSS fails. “If that agreement does not work, South Sudan will be empty of its population. Now it is not our intention to empty South Sudan. I think first of all the biggest responsibility lies with the leadership of South Sudan,” said Affey.
–       Status of parties not signatories to the R-ARCSS
Last year, in early December, the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan Amb. Ismail Wais met with members of the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS as mandated by the 66th Session of Igad Council of Ministers that was held in Addis Ababa on 16 November 2018.
The meeting was attended by the leader the National Salvation Front (NAS) Gen. Thomas Cirilllo, Gen. Fair Fatur and Mr Louis Danga of the South Sudan National Democratic Alliance, among others.
A press release published by Igad says Gen. Cirillo stated that his party was ready to continue the dialogue and engagement with IGAD and all the parties and stakeholders of South Sudan and agreed to abide by the December 2017 Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access.
“We will continue to bring on board all parties to sign the agreement and leave no one behind. This is the best chance for sustainable peace to the conflict in South Sudan,” said Dr Wais as he assured Gen. Cirillo and his delegation of continued engagement with all the parties and stakeholders of the South Sudan process “in order to help find lasting peace.”
In December last year also, envoy Wais met with the leader of the South Sudan United Front/Army (SSUF), the former SPLA chief of General Staff, Gen. Paul Malong. Gen. Malong agreed to observe the ceasefire agreement and declared that his movement is committed to pursuing a non-violent resolution to the conflict in South Sudan.
Moving fast to January 2019, we are yet to see the outcome of the engagements between the Igad envoy and the parties. The dialogue, however, is worth pursuing.
–       Continued violence and challenges facing ceasefire monitors
Early this month, the South Sudan People’s Defence Force SSPDF said NAS killed 19 civilians and wounded eight others in a small village between Goroum and Wonduruba in Jubek State. NAS on their part said the massacre was done by the SSPDF after their “defeat” by NAS. So far there is no independently verified account of the incident.
Meanwhile, the chairperson of the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMVM) Maj. Gen. Desta Abiche Ageno said the National Security Service (NSS) denied the CTSAMVM access to investigate the incident of the killings in Gorom.
“CTSAMM attempted to visit Gorom to complete the investigation on the reported incident, but were denied access by NSS at the Luri checkpoint,” Gen. Abiche said.
In mid this month, according to the Catholic Radio Network CRN, the spokesperson of the SSPDF Major Gen Lul Ruai said NAS is a threat to the implementation of the R-ARCSS. Gen. Ruai said the SSPDF will hunt down NAS since it is the mandate of the government to “protect its people”, the CRN reported. The SSPDF spokesperson also added that it would be in the “best interest” of the SPLA-IO to join forces with the SSPDF to “eliminate” NAS.
“We are going to have joint patrols in hot spots area…to protect this peace from anti-peace element namely, Thomas Cirilo who has been on the offensive,” Eye Radio quoted the spokesperson of SSPDF, Gen. Ruai as saying while accusing NAS of attacking civilians.
As quoted by Eye Radio, NAS spokesperson Suba Samuel responded saying, “All these accusations that they are making are baseless and do not have any sense. They are in a panic because the revitalized peace agreement they signed is not moving anywhere.”
On 23rd this month, Eye Radio reported that the interim Chairman of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission R-JMEC Lt. Gen. Augostino Njoroge said NAS leader was not abiding by the ceasefire deal which he signed in December 2017.
“I’m concerned to learn from CTSAM’s report from their 6th technical meeting that General Thomas Cirilo [the leader of NAS] is not observing the terms of the cessation of hostilities agreement which he signed in December 2017,” Eye Radio quoted Njoroge as saying.
On their part, NAS responded, describing Njoroge’s statement as “unbalanced”. “The statement by Mr Njoroge undermines the institution and will affect trust and confidence building in the entire peace process,” Eye Radio quoted NAS as saying.
Meanwhile, the CTSAMVM Chairperson Maj. Gen. Abiche said recent weeks have witnessed a military build-up and that there are multiple parties in close proximity, including both signatories and non-signatories to the R-ARCSS.
“The area in and around Yei Town continues to cause concern. The situation is complex and the command and control structure of some groups in the area is unknown at this time,” said Gen. Abiche in his opening remarks at the 3rd CTSAMVM Board Meeting on 22nd of this month.
He said CTSAMVM continues to observe unauthorised military movement in numerous locations throughout the country.
“The issue of Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Bentiu also remains a huge concern and while reported cases of SGBV have dropped somewhat in recent weeks there is a serious break down of law and order in the area and the Parties continue to fail in their obligation to protect civilians,” said Gen. Abiche.
He said CTSAMVM continues to face limitations on freedom of movement in various locations throughout the country.
“The incident in Luri on the 18th December 2018, in which CTSAMVM monitors were assaulted and detained is just one example.
“We have also faced denial of access from the SSPDF and SPLA-IO when we have attempted to visit locations to conduct verification of forces as required by our mandate. The Luri incident is a very serious and grave violation of the peace agreement and we are continuing to urge the TGoNU to take action and hold the perpetrators accountable,” he added.
Gen. Abiche further disclosed that CTSAMVM has not deployed a national monitoring component due to lack of funds. “…our national monitors are yet to be deployed due to budget constraints. Specifically, there is a lack of budget for health and life insurance, accommodation as well as allowance (Out of pocket). We are working with the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) and other Parties and stakeholders to explore all possible avenues to resolve this issue and we hope to report progress in this area very soon,” he said.
But the Chairperson of the CTSAMVM also mentioned some progress including the “first ever reported case of dis-engagement” of forces in Bill Payam, Unity State.
“I also want to make note of the fact that, having previously identified Wau as a hotspot area, we can report that over the last two months there have been no major incidents reported in that location.
“Across the country at the grassroots levels, the Parties are continuing to engage in confidence and trust building meetings. There is a growing momentum within the Parties to collectively find local level solutions to the issues they are facing on the ground,” Gen. Abiche said.
–       How the International Community should support the R-ARCSS
The international community and partners should support the R-ARCSS in the following ways/under the following conditions:
1-    The support ought to start with the signing of the Agreement. While any Country is free to choose whether to sign the Agreement or not, it would be prudent for the above-mentioned Countries which have not signed the R-ARCSS, to sign it, at least with reservations on the parts they may not agree with. Signing the R-ARCSS is crucial in giving weight to the Agreement and holding the parties accountable.
2-    The relevant Countries mentioned above should voluntarily send their nominees to Igad for appointments into the IBC. Then the international community together with the parties and anyone concerned should pressure Igad to officially form the IBC so that the body catches up with the implementation schedules. A lot of the current tensions shall be no more once the states number and the tribal boundaries are amicably and justly resolved before the start of the transitional period, and that is still possible.
As the National Democratic Movement (NDM) chaired by Dr Lam Akol stated in a recent report warning Igad, “The consequences of not settling the controversial issue of the 32 States on R-ARCSS before the onset of the Transitional Period are too grave to be ignored.”
3-    The government of South Sudan should be pressured to contribute a substantial amount for the implementation of the R-ARCSS, in addition to the $1 Million and SSP 100 Million (which is very little) that they have given on Wednesday 23rd. Thereafter, other donors should be able to come in and help. There is no reason for the government to allocate $1 Million and SSP 100 Million only, while it just gave out SSP 1.2 Million each to its nearly 400 MPs for peace dissemination, after giving the same MPs a total of $16 Million for buying cars about six months ago.
4-    On 25th this month, German Ambassador to South Sudan Jan Hendrik was quoted by Eye Radio as saying, “In the past, a lot of money was put in the peace process, war broke out and so on. [But] all this money was lost.
“This country is in a very bad situation after this war. So, there are some lessons learnt here. I think we need to discuss, there needs to be more transparency on the public finances in South Sudan.”
Indeed the issues raised by the Ambassador are very crucial and deserve attention and appropriate rectifications. Up in this article, I have tackled the issue of the use of a lot of money in the past (on ARCSS) even when it was not being implemented in letter and spirit and I would not like to repeat myself.
However, on the issue of transparency on public finances, it depends: is it finances to (of) the government of South Sudan or finances for the peace implementation (the peace monitoring body, JMEC and the other ARCSS mechanisms)? If it finances to (of) the government of South Sudan, it is well known that there is a lack of transparency and accountability there. That is why the R-ARCSS, just like the ARCSS, provides for reforms of several institutions and legislation to fight corruption and enhance transparency and accountability. But that is going to be a process through the implementation of the R-ARCSS, as per the stipulated schedules, which we expect to happen during the transitional period as required by the Agreement.
Secondly, if it finances for the peace implementation (the peace monitoring body, JMEC and the other ARCSS mechanisms), we expect the envoys (donor Countries and the international community) to be better informed about how the money was (is being) spent since they (donor countries and the international community) have representatives who are part (members) of the JMEC and they have been attending JMEC meetings since its establishment. We, as the public, would like to know also but there is no published report on how the money was (is being) spent by the JMEC and its various bodies.
There are loopholes and vague provisions in both the then ARCSS and now the R-ARCSS. The R-ARCSS provides that The RJMEC shall oversee the work of the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM), the Economic and Financial Management Authority (EFMA), the Strategic Defence and Security Review Board (SDSRB), the National Elections Commission (NEC), and all other transitional institutions and mechanisms created by the R-ARCSS and that all those bodies and other institutions and mechanisms created by the R-ARCSS shall present regular reports to RJMEC.
Though the Agreement says the secretariat for RJMEC shall be independent and shall seek international administrative support, it also provides that the terms of reference of RJMEC shall be endorsed by the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government. Those were the same provisions of the then ARCSS but over the previous years of ARCSS “implementation”, there was never any terms of references of the then JMEC provided in the public domain.
What is very important on the topic under discussion here is that there is no explicit provision on how the JMEC (now R-JMEC) shall account for the finances it and the bodies under it receive for the implementation of the Agreement.
Article 7.9. of the R-ARCSS is vague as it simply says “the RJMEC shall brief regularly the Executive of the RTGoNU, and submit written reports, followed by detailed briefings, to the RTGoNU Council of Ministers, the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, the Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union and to the Secretary-General and Security Council of the United Nations on the status of implementation of this Agreement every three (3) months,” but there is nowhere that it talks about how funds shall be used.
What could be done now to remedy the situation since the R-ARCSS is already in force? It is simple since the donor countries also have representatives in the RJMEC. The donor countries should work with the RJMEC to adopt a formula for accountability for peace implementation funds and such a method should be able to regularly publish their financial reports to the public, for scrutiny and accountability. If they reject transparency and accountability, the donor countries should not fund the R-ARCSS implementation.
The issue of transparency on the use of peace funds are actions which the region and members of the international community (donor countries) can ensure through their memberships in the RJMEC.
In addition to the membership of the South Sudanese Parties, Stakeholders and Adherents stipulated in the Agreement, the RJMEC shall comprise the following:
A-Regional Guarantors, thirteen (13) representatives:
Ethiopia – one (1) representative;
Djibouti- one (1) representative;
Kenya – one (1) representative;
Somalia- one (1) representative;
Sudan – one (1) representative;
Uganda – one (1) representative;
The AU-HLAHC, five (5) each represented by one (1);
African Union Commission – one (1) representative; and
IGAD Secretariat – one (1) representative.
B-International Partners and Friends of South Sudan, seven (7) representatives:
People’s Republic of China – one (1) representative;
Norway– one (1) representative;
United Kingdom – one (1) representative;
United States – one (1) representative;
United Nations – one (1) representative;
European Union – one (1) representative; and
IPF- one (1) representative.
(See Article 7.2, Article 7.2.3, and Article 7.2.4 of the R-ARCSS on the composition of the RJMEC)
Back on the issue of transparency and accountability on the use of peace funds, with respect to the NPTC, the body entrusted with the function of oversight and coordination of the implementation of the activities of the Pre– Transitional Period in collaboration with the Incumbent TGoNU, as per ARCSS Article 1.4.7.2 read together with Article 1.4.3, there are some provisions for transparency in their work, which should be implemented in letter and spirit. For example, Article 1.4.7.4 of the R-ARCSS stipulates that the NPTC shall submit monthly written reports to Chairperson of the Reconstituted JMEC (RJMEC), the parties and other stakeholders.
Another relevant provision is Article 1.4.8 of the R-ARCSS which says “there shall be established a fund, to be drawn from government funds and contributions of donors, for the implementation of the activities of the Pre–Transitional Period. The fund shall be deposited by the Ministry of Finance and Planning of the Incumbent TGoNU in a special account in a bank agreed to by the NPTC. The NPTC shall manage the fund transparently and report on it monthly to the President of the Republic of South Sudan and to the Parties.” On this, while donating, the donors should give conditions that the NPTC regularly publishes the reports including to the general public for scrutiny and accountability.
5-    Supporting the R-ARCSS should also be based on the conditions that the parties adhere to the terms of the Agreement, including the Permanent Ceasefire and the December 2017 Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (in the case of the Government vs. the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS i.e. NAS, SSUF/A, etc.)
Meanwhile, the dialogue by the Igad mediation on the inclusion of the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS should continue for an all-inclusive peace in the Country.
Recently, one of the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS, the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM) called on the international donors to abstain from funding the implementation of the R-ARCSS until a new deal is reached.
“The flawed R-ARCSS needs to be re-opened to put the people first, address the root causes of conflict and re-make R-ARCSS for power sharing between the peoples of Equatoria, Upper Nile and Bahr al Ghazal,” PDM’s leader Dr Hakim Dario said in a press statement.
Well, as dialogue is being pursued through the Igad process to bring on board the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS, the region, the international partners and all concerned should be brainstorming on what shall happen next in case the dialogue fails to bear success. What are the chances that the December 2017 Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access would continue to hold in the absence of a final political settlement (Agreement) between the government and the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS? And until when shall it hold, given the fact that the other parties (R-ARCSS signatories) and the region are moving on with the implementation of the Agreement while the R-ARCSS non-signatories remain in the bushes of South Sudan or in the diaspora? What are the demands of the R-ARCSS non-signatories? How popular are those demands among the people of South Sudan? Is practically possible to incorporate those demands into the Igad-led process (R-ARCSS)? If yes, why not? If not, does it mean a full-scale war shall resume now or in the coming months (years)? Does it mean that the R-ARCSS is incapable of bringing freedom and lasting peace to the people of South Sudan? Those are all questions worth asking in this search for a comprehensive peace in South Sudan, though it is also the right of any party to enter willingly into an Agreement.
6-    The government of South Sudan should ensure that reported incidents like the one in Luri on the 18th December 2018, in which CTSAMVM monitors were allegedly assaulted by the NSS are investigated and justice is delivered, in order to deter the occurrence of the same.
An independent and verifiable investigation by the CTSAMVM into the killing of 19 civilians and wounding of eight others in the village between Goroum and Wonduruba in Jubek State should be urgently carried out so that the perpetrators are held accountable.
On the other hand, the government of South Sudan should lift the state of emergency declared by President Kiir in some parts of the country during the time of the conflict. Political Freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech should all be guaranteed/allowed countrywide.
In the same spirit of peace, the government should beef up security in areas with cattle raids and deadly tribal or inter-tribal clashes. In Bieh State, at least 42 people had been killed and over 78 others wounded after armed men attacked cattle Keepers in Duachan and Kolabiel, officials say. While in Tonj, at least 105 people had been killed and 47 others wounded, also, after armed men attacked cattle keepers, an official said. Both incidents happened just within this month, while several others have happened over the recent months. That is totally unacceptable. The people are under government-controlled areas and is the obligation of the government to provide security for them. It is unacceptable that some parts of the Country would live in relative peace while others in perpetual deaths and violence. The government and the people should come up with policies to stop such deaths even if, as someone recently suggested, it means designating specific areas for grazing cattle and providing security in those areas in collaboration with the governments of such areas. These are all legitimate demands and the international community (donors) have more power to pressure the government of South Sudan into improving the situation in the Country, as the government seeks funding for the R-ARCSS implementation. The international community should use that power.
7-    Therefore, as the international community and donor countries are being asked by the parties to fund the R-ARCSS implementation, they should pressure the government to release (free) or charge before competent court those of Dr Peter Biar Ajak and entrepreneur/philanthropist Kerubino Wol and any other person under such detention. The provision of funds by the international community should be based on such demands. It is neither Constitutional nor acceptable for a security service to detain individuals without a charge. Any person supporting such a system should know that it might be him or her facing such a detention one day. Our recent history is very clear on that.
Not only that, but from now onwards, the National Security Service NSS should adhere to the South Sudan Transitional Constitution which limits the NSS to information gathering, analysis and advice to relevant authorities (e.g. the Police.). Arrests and detentions are the work of the police. Implementation of an Agreement like R-ARCSS that seeks to reform the country requires an environment where people are not detained without charges for months.
Furthermore, efforts should as well be exerted to establish the whereabouts of lawyer Dong Samuel Luak and opposition official Aggrey Idri Ezbon who were abducted from Nairobi in January 2017 and remain missing up to date. Whoever is holding them should release them in the spirit of the peace implementation.
8-    The government of South Sudan should guarantee/protect freedom of the media in the Country.  This is very important as it is through a free media that the Agreement can be successfully implemented. The government must commit itself to respect press freedom. If at any time, there are continued attacks on the freedom of the press like it has happened recently in the case of the South Sudan Media Authority with Alwatan Newspaper, funding for the R-ARCSS implementation should not be given or should be withheld (if some has been given already.)
9-    There is a need for the international community and people of good will to seize this chance by gradually fund some aspects of the peace agreement. This is a way to win against the anti-reform elements in South Sudan who want the Agreement to collapse for their selfish interests then they would cite lack of funding as a scapegoat for not implementing the reforms stipulated in the R-ARCSS. The funding should be moderate and should be offered stage by stage, depending on the progress in the implementation of the Agreement. Once there is no progress, the funding should be stopped immediately before wasting more money and efforts.

The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Malik Agar claim that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia launched “a massive offensive” against its troops in Blue Nile state.
The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Malik Agar claim that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia launched “a massive offensive” against its troops in Blue Nile state.
A statement issued by the chief of staff of the SPLM-N, Ahmed El Omda said that “the attack of government forces comes in favour of gold exploration companies and seizure of peoples’ land”.
El Omda said that three days ago, the RSF launched a massive preparatory bombardment against the SPLM-N forces at Taka and Kalkoa mountains, about 32 kilometres from the state capital El Damazin.
He added that the government forces intensively used artillery. He said that aircraft were not involved in the bombardment, but were used to attempt to monitor the SPLM-N positions.
The statement predicted that there could be a clash at any time.

Title: New govt. attacks on rebel sites in Darfur’s Jebel Marra - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The mainstream Sudan Liberation Movement headed by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) claims its fighters withstood militia attacks on rebel bases in East Jebel Marra on Friday.The movement’s spokesman, Waleed Abakar, told Radio Dabanga that two RSF convoys backed by gunmen on camels and horses launched new attacks on the movement’s sites in South Darfur’s East Jebel Marra.
The mainstream Sudan Liberation Movement headed by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) claims its fighters withstood militia attacks on rebel bases in East Jebel Marra on Friday.
The movement's spokesman, Waleed Abakar, told Radio Dabanga that two convoys of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan's main militia, backed by gunmen on camels and horses launched new attacks on the movement’s sites in South Darfur’s East Jebel Marra.
“On Friday morning, one militia convoy moved from the Gakoro military garrison and the other one left the Rufta garrison to attack the SLM-AW sites in the areas of Gulik, Abulkheirat. and Sedda,” he said.
He said their forces repulsed the militiamen in the area of Luo, west of the Rufta garrison, and Terela, northwest of Gakoro.
The fighting was ongoing until sunset on Friday.
Offensives
During the dry seasons (roughly between January-and May) in the past years, government forces have made various attempts to eliminate the SLM-AW bases in the Jebel Marra region.
In March this year, rebel sites in East Jebel Marra were attacked. The fighting causedan estimated 50,000 people to fleetheir villages in the area.
Last year, the attacks focused onnorthwest Jebel Marra. According to an RSF spokesmanin February 2017, Darfur became“free of armed movements, suspects, and outlaws, except for a small [SLM-AW] group stationed at the top of Jebel Marra”.
In 2016,more than 80,000 peoplewere displaced by a major military offensive against the holdout rebels in the mountainous region of the Jebel Marra.

♦ Hundreds of Darfuris detained in Sudan prisons despite release order
April 17 – 2018 KHARTOUMHundreds of Darfuris are still being held in detention by the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) despite the order of President Omar Al Bashir to release all political detainees from the country’s prisons last week.
Kober prison in Khartoum and Port Sudan prison still hold 61 detainees of the Maaliya tribesmen who have been there for more than nine months, along with seven university students who were arrested after organising speeches at a market in Khartoum last year.
While the release was welcomed by people in Sudan and organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, “the detentions should never have occurred in the first place”, they said. People were held in inhumane, cramped conditions, with more than 20 detainees kept in 5m by 7m cells, or smaller, according to Amnesty.
Yesterday activistslisted 292 peoplewho have been held in detention for months, allegedly because of their loyalty to militias that oppose the government. Among them are displaced people and activists from camps in Jebel Marra.According to Sudanese human rights groups, the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) is holding thepolitical detainees as hostages“to prevent the Sudanese opposition fromcarrying out protests against the government”. “The political detainees from the leftist parties would be released if their parties stop demonstrating and behave themselves!” the NISS director had said in a newspaper interview in February.

♦ North Darfur, UNHCR welcome 53 Sudanese refugees from Chad
April 17 – 2018 TINAFifty-three Sudanese refugees have returned to Sudan from camps in Chad where they have been staying for years. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Commissioner of Refugees (COR) welcomed the first convoy of voluntary returnees in North Darfur.
Some 300,000 Sudanese refugees currently reside in eastern Chad. Adam El Nour Abakar, who fled Sudan to Chad 15 years ago and returned home voluntarily, said: “I’m so happy to return back to my country with my family. I am eager to catch the agricultural season in my home area in Kabkabiya.”
After this first convoy, governments of Sudan and Chad, and the UNHCR expect to assist in the voluntary repatriation of 20,000 Sudanese refugees, all of whom fled to eastern Chad following eruption of conflicts in Darfur in 2003 and 2004.In February, Sudan’s President Omar Al Bashir instructed the acceleration of work on the voluntary repatriation of Sudanese refugees in Chad and the return of Chadian refugees in Sudan.
Throughout 2018 Radio Dabanga has received reports of attacks on people leaving the camps for displaced Darfuris to return home. Witnesses said that attacks are caused by roaming militias andarmed new settlersin the home areas.

Title: South Sudan holdout group reiterate calls to open peace pact for negotiations - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Hakim Dario, PDM leaderFebruary 26t 2019 (JUBA) – The non-signatory groups will not join the “flawed” revitalized peace agreement without renegotiation and the IGAD should consider including their “legitimate” demands, said the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM)’s leader Hakim Dario on Tuesday.
On 25 February, the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan Ismail Wais met with the National Salvation Front (NAS) leader Thomas Cirilo who is also the chairman of the South Sudan National Democratic Alliance (SSNDA).
The meeting discussed the parties’ commitment to the cessation of hostilities agreement of 21 December 2017 and ways to include the non-signatory factions of SSNDA in the revitalized peace agreement.
“PDM is dismayed that IGAD has made a choice for conflict and is not in favour of renegotiating R-ARCSS to include legitimate demands of the non-signatories. The IGAD Special Envoy is asking non-signatories to join implementation of R-ARCSS only (…),” said Dario in a statement to Sudan Tribune 24 hours after the meeting.
The consultation with Cirilo “about stopping the war in Yei is misplaced because IGAD knows well who started it” he further said before to add “The talks about stopping the war in Yei should be with President Salva Kiir”.
The holdout groups call for genuine autonomy for the regions to protect its population from the mismanagement of their resources and land grabbing by a central government controlled by one ethnic group.
However, the IGAD Council of Ministers has rejected their claims since November 2018 when it asked them to join the deal or to label them as peace “spoilers”.
Dario stressed they only welcome the talks for reviewing the “flawed agreement” and that the IGAD mediation principles are ” imposing a high cost for a further transition to maintain impunity and dictatorial rule”.
The opposition PDM called upon the AU, IGAD, UN and TROIKA countries to sanction President Salva Kiir for the war crimes and atrocities committed against the people of Equatoria in Yei, and to recognize the urgency and need to negotiate a just and lasting peace.
Next May, the signatories of the revitalized peace agreement will form a transitional national unity government that would face increasing several challenges from the lack of money to the slow implementation of the peace agreement and the continuation of the war in the south-western part of the country.

South Sudanese arrivals in Sudan’s White Nile State wait in a shaded area for registration and assistance at Al Waral site on 12 April 2017 (UNHCR Photo)March 3, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The former governor of the White Nile State Abu Al-Gasim al-Amin Baraka said the state is hosting 160,000 South Sudanese refugees in the camps besides 60,000 in the various towns.
He pointed out that the government of White Nile State has been saddled with a further financial burden as a result of the presence of large numbers of South Sudanese refugees.
It is noteworthy that Baraka on Sunday has handed over his position to the newly appointed military governor of White Nile State Ahmed Khamis.
Over 2 million South Sudanese refugees have been displaced as a result of the conflict that hit the world’s youngest nation in mid-December 2013.
According to the UN Higher Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 15 January 2018, the total South Sudanese refugee population in Sudan stood at 770,110.
Other sources estimate a total of 1.3 million South Sudanese refugees in Sudan, but this data requires verification.
South Sudanese refugees in Sudan have reportedly been distributed in four states including the White Nile, South Kordofan, East Darfur and Khartoum states, amid concerns the current numbers will rise.
In August 2016, Sudan officially declared that South Sudanese fleeing war in their country will be treated as refugees, which opens the door for the UN to provide them with aid and fund aid programs.

Sudanese demonstrators gather as they participate in anti-government protests in Khartoum, Sudan January 17, 2019. (Photo Reuters)January 21, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese ministry of health said that the Sudanese doctor killed in Burri suburb last Thursday was shot in his back.
In a press conference held on Sunday, Mahjoub Babikir a Forensic Medicine Specialist said that Babikir Abdel Hamid who was murdered during Burri protests was dissected to determine the cause of his death.
“He was shot by a weapon from a distance of 4 to 10 meters in the back, said Dr Mahjoub who added that he was wounded in the lung as a result of a gunshot.
Further, he pointed to the presence of semi-circular metal objects in the body of the victim saying they hand it over to the Criminal Evidence Section to determine the type of calibre and weapon that used to kill him.
However, he denied that the wounds were caused by a shot a close range or by a cluster bullet.
Dr Babikir reportedly was killed by the Sudanese security forces which broke into a house where he was treating wounded protesters.
Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir said the doctor was from within the protesters by a weapon that is neither held by the army and police nor does it exist in Sudan.
The head of the National Intelligence and Security Services, Salah Gosh said in a meeting with the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) cadres that the Sudanese doctor was killed by an arm that the Sudanese police or his services do not use.
Al-Bashir went to accuse the rebels of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdel al-Nur saying they have been ordered to kill demonstrators to inflame the already tense situation.
Activists and opposition groups accuse the militiamen of the NCP called the Popular Forces of firing live bullets on the protesters.

Next:ARTILLERY: Saudis Get As Much As They Need
April 26, 2018:Aid organizations report that continued fighting in South Sudan is hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid. In northeast South Sudan (Upper Nile state) this continues to be a serious problem. Since January fighting in Upper Nile between government and rebel forces has been quite heavy. Combat and refugee movements have disrupted convoy and delivery operations. At the moment aid organizations estimate 4.8 million people in South Sudan are food insecure -- which means the people do not have consistent access to food required to survive.
April 25, 2018: President Kir of South Sudan refused to consider demands that he, and he main rebel leader Riek Machar, no longer participate in the peace negotiations. That would mean Kir resigning as president. The rivalry between Kir and Machar triggered the civil war and to a large extent kept it going. While Kir is still in power Machar is more of a figurehead among the many rebel factions. Foreign observers agree that real peace would probably be more likely without Kir and Machar involved. Kir refuses to leave office.
April 23, 2018: The government of South Sudan has rejected demands by opposition parties to "overhaul" the country's security forces and reorganize the government. The government says it has already agreed to make institutional reforms. If the civil war ends, rebel fighters will be able to re-integrate into society. One demand by the political opposition and the armed rebel (SPLM-IO) does seem to have significant support. The opposition parties want the government to disband the 32 states that now exist and return to the previous ten state structure.
April 22, 2018: Sudan and Ethiopia have refused an Egyptian request to resume discussions about the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project. Egypt fears the dam will reduce the amount of Nile River water it receives.
April 21, 2018: In western Sudan, the Darfur rebel Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) claimed government forces attacked its fighters in the northern Jebel Marra. There have been at least three "fierce" firefights in the area. One firefight occurred in Katti. The SLM-AW also claimed that on April 20 government militiamen burned four villages in the area: Sankara, Hilla Hajja Madina, Loki Warrro, and Gharab Waffir.
April 20, 2018: Sudan accused Egypt of letting people living in a disputed border area vote in the March Egyptian presidential elections. Sudan lodged an official protest with the UN Security Council. The voting was held in the Halayeb triangle, a border zone claimed by both Sudan and Egypt.
In South Sudan, the American embassy announced increased security measures because of renewed fighting between soldiers and rebels outside the capital.
April 19, 2018: In South Sudan army the army and rebel forces are fighting in at least two areas. A major battle is occurring in the town of Gezira (100 kilometers southeast of the capital). The government claims the rebels are trying to seize it before a new ceasefire is implemented.
April 18, 2018: The ambassadors to Sudan and South Sudan from the EU and five "donor" European nations have ended a two-day long visit to the disputed (between Sudan and South Sudan) Abyei region. Ambassadors from Britain, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden met with leaders from the Ngok Dinka, Dinka Agok and Misseriya tribes as well as officials from the peacekeepers and border monitoring force. The ambassadors showed their support for a peaceful resolution of the Abyei dispute. Both Sudan and South Sudan claim the area.
The East African IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) announced another postponement of South Sudan's "peace implementation" talks. The ceasefire signed in December 2017 is the basis for the talks. The ceasefire, however, was violated by both sides in the ceasefire's first 12 hours.
Sudan accused the Darfur JEM rebels of failing to agree to reasonable compromises proposed by international mediators. The government, the JEM and the SLMMM (Sudan Liberation Movement-Minnni Minnawi) rebels met for two days in Berlin to discuss a framework for future negotiations to end the war in western Sudan (Darfur). The war began in 2003 and Sudan wants to use the DDPD (Doha Document for Peace in Darfur) as a basis for negotiation. Neither rebel faction agrees. They demand a new approach. The Doha agreement was made in July 2011 with several other Darfur rebel organizations. The African Union is sponsoring the talks. Diplomats thought a "pre-negotiation agreement" was possible.
April 14, 2018: In Sudan RSF (Rapid Support Forces) leaders asked the EU to pay them for guarding the Sudan-Libya border and preventing migrants from reaching the Mediterranean Sea. An RSF commander said his units are defending the EU. The RSF has been accused of committing atrocities and now they are trying export some money from the EU for preventing illegal migrants from reaching Europe.
April 13, 2018: In northern South Sudan (Northern Liech state) government forces were accused of attacking rebels for no reason. Several attacks were launched on April 4 on rebel positions in Boaw and Nhialdiu. Other government forces struck rebel positions in Rukuai. Fighting continued through today. In southern South Sudan, there was a similar battle in Yei state.
April 10, 2018: Sudan promised to continue to participate in the Arab coalition fighting Yemeni rebels. Saudi Arabia leads the coalition. Sudan made the pledge after a rebel ambush killed "several dozen" Sudanese soldiers recently.
April 9, 2018: In northeast South Sudan (Bieh state) rebels claim the captured of 61 South Sudan soldiers who promptly went over to the rebels. The soldiers were preparing to attack a rebel position in Bieh state and were armed with new AK-47 type rifles.
In South Sudan Paul Malong, former chief of staff of the army announced that he is forming SS-UF (South Sudan United Front) a rebel movement that will stop the fighting in South Sudan. Malong accused the current government leaders of "looting" the country. Malong said his new organization will join forces with SSOA (South Sudan Opposition Alliance), a rebel group formed in late December 2017.
April 6, 2018: South Sudan rejected accusations Sudan made yesterday that South Sudan was supporting Sudanese rebel groups and letting the rebel groups use bases in South Sudan. South Sudan pointed out that it was trying to eliminate all rebels in South Sudan.
In Yemen Arab coalition troops from Sudan were ambushed by rebels who opened fire on several trucks loaded with Sudanese soldiers, killing over 30 of them. These were the heaviest losses suffered by the Sudanese troops since they arrived in 2o15. The ambushed Sudanese troops were part of the reinforcements being sent north, from quieter areas in the south, to push the rebels away from the Red Sea.
April 4, 2018: In northeast Congo, a search is on for who has supplied warring ethnic groups with light weapons. The weapons may have come from South Sudan, a side effect of the civil war there. South Sudan has become a major market for blackmarket arms dealers as well as a transshipment point for new weapons headed for other customers in central Africa.
At a meeting in Niger Libya agreed with its three southern neighbors (Sudan, Niger and Chad) to reestablish joint border controls so the Libya will cease being a lawless area where all sorts of criminal operations can operate freely. Another meeting will be held in a month to start working out the details and the rules that all will follow.
April 3, 2018: In southern Sudan the government extended its unilateral ceasefire in what the government calls “the Two Areas” (South Kordofan and Blue Nile states). A government ceasefire in western Sudan (Darfur) will also continue. The ceasefires will last through the end of June.
April 2, 2018: In northeast South Sudan (Upper Nile state) rebels claim they defeated government attacks in the Ketbek and Padanyang. The first attack was launched on March 31 and then another major attack came on April 1. In the south (Central Equatoria state) rebels reported pro-government forces also attacked a pro-rebel village.

March 3, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The emergency courts established by President Omer al-Bashir have continued to impose various sentences of imprisonment and fines on people who participated in anti-government protests.
A special judge sits in court in Nyala during the trial of six Sudanese men accused of belonging to the Janjaweed, 30 September 2004 (Reuters)The Democratic Lawyers Alliance, a member of the Sudanese Professional Association, said 870 protesters were produced in emergency courts in Khartoum and Omdurman following a number of protests across the Sudanese capital last Thursday.
An emergency court in Khartoum-North on Sunday sentenced to jail for four months seven demonstrators arrested last Thursday and ordered the release of five others acquitted for lack of evidence against them.
Also, the Khartoum Criminal Court acquitted a number of demonstrators on Saturday, while others were convicted in the court of Kalakala district of a fine of 1,000 pounds.
The Sudan Doctors Syndicate said that one of its members was sentenced Thursday to three years in jail.
In a statement on Sunday, the Syndicate, which sends medical teams to treat wounded protesters, said that Mohamed Abdel Karim Mohamed a teaching assistant at Al-Azhari University has been sentenced to jail by the emergency court and transferred to Al-Huda prison in Omdurman.
In western Kordofan state, all detainees have been released in recent protests in the state.
The State Government Secretary Abdel Moneim Fadl al-Mawla said in a press release that the 11 detainees arrested during the protests had been released.
For its part, the government of North Kordofan state announced the release of 25 demonstrators who have been prosecuted under the emergency law since the end of last year.
North Kordofan has been under emergency law since mid-2018 and extended in January.
The governor of North Kordofan, Major General al-Marredi al-Siddiq al-Marredi, according to the official Sudan News Agency, said that the release of prisoners comes as a prelude “to serious dialogue with young people”.
He further said that this step will be followed by similar steps to free the rest of the prisoners provided there are sufficient guarantees they would not “call to sabotage” again, according to SUNA.
On 22 February, Sudanese President imposed the state of emergency for one year banning all unauthorized rallies but also given sweeping powers to security forces to quell the nationwide protests. Also, he ordered to establish emergency courts.
Immediately after the protests of Thursday, the exceptional courts issued sentences against 59 protesters to prison sentences ranging from two months to seven years, including 17 defendants in the Khartoum North, 22 in Omdurman and 20 in Khartoum.
