The Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council led by the imprisoned militia leader Musa Hilal, declared in a statement yesterday that it will launch military action to overthrow the regime in Sudan.
The Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council led by the imprisoned militia leader Musa Hilal, declared in a statement yesterday that it will launch military action to overthrow the regime in Sudan.
Ahmed Abakar, spokesman for the council (RAC) denounced the economic conditions in the country and the lack of political freedoms in Sudan. He pointed out that the Sudanese government and the ruling National Congress Party are responsible.
Therefore the council “officially announces the launch of the military phase to liberate the country from the grip of the ruling gang through revolutionary action and military confrontation with the Khartoum government, which will continue by all means available.”
The RAC leaders have taken this decision in view of the country's structural imbalances regarding the financial and health situation, as well as the suppression of public opinion and attempts to dismantle camps for displaced people, according to Abakar.
Arrests
Sheikh Musa Hilal, known as the former commander of janjaweed forces, wasarrested in November 2017when he refused to let the affiliatedBorder Guards forces hand over their weaponsto join the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of Sudan.His trial secretly beganon April 30.
Last week, the Sudan National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) raided the Omdurman house of Ismail El Aghbash, a member of the leadership of the RAC and arrested 10 members of the Council.
Hilal is held responsible for the atrocities committed in Darfur against civilians after the conflict erupted in 2003. In that year, he was released from prison by the Sudanese government with the purpose to mobilise Darfuri Arab herders to fight the insurgency in the region.
With full government backing, Hilal's militiamen (popularly known as janjaweed)targeted villages of African Darfuris. In January 2014, he announced his defection from the ruling National Congress Party he was then enrolled in, and established the RAC.
Security in Darfur
A recent United Nations report said that the security situation in Darfur has improved and set plans for the full withdrawal of its peacekeeping Unamid troops in 2020. In October Jeremiah Mamabolo, the head of Unamid told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) said that they havenot witnessed “any adverse impact”on “the security situation and protection of civilian in areas from which Unamid has withdrawn” so far.
However, according to a report by the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) various developments contributed to the deterioration of the security situation in Darfur last year. Thousands of members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, were stationed in Darfur to carry out thecollection of illegal arms and unregistered vehicles.

October 4, 2019 (KAMPALA) – South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir and the armed opposition leader Riek Machar will meet in the Kampala, Uganda on Thursday, an opposition official said Tuesday.
“The Kampala meeting between President Kiir and Dr. Riek Machar has been postponed until Thursday, September 7,” Puok Both Baluang, the armed opposition movement’s deputy director for public relations toldSudan Tribuneon Tuesday.
The meeting between the two rival leaders, he said, will mainly focus on the outstanding issues and the period of execution of the pre-transitional period”.
This would be the third face-to-face meeting between both rival leaders since the revitalized peace agreement was signed in September 2018 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
South Sudan descended into war in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy-turned rebel leader Machar of plotting a coup, allegations he dismissed.
In September last year, South Sudan’s arch-foes signed a revitalized peace agreement to end the country’s civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.
According to the 2018 peace deal, a unity government was supposed to be formed in May, but due to unresolved issues, the parties agreed to a six-month extension, settling on November 12.
The International Crisis Group (ICG) warned Monday that war-torn South Sudan could slide back into war, if a coalition government is formed on November 12 without compromises on key issues.

Title: Sudan's fashion police shave off afros - BusinessGhana
In the last few weeks social media users in Sudan have been horrified by videos and pictures of young men's afros being shaved off by the former Janjaweed forces in some of the poor areas of the capital, Khartoum.
The government-backed Janjaweed militia, accused of carrying out atrocities in the western region of Darfur in the early 2000s, now have a new role.
They were accused of riding camels and horses into villages seen as sympathetic to rebels, burning them to the ground, killing the men and raping the women.
Now renamed the Rapid Support Forces, they have been tasked with tracking down traffickers and stopping migrants heading to Europe - a role funded by the European Union (EU), although the EU has denied that any money goes to the ex-Janjaweed.
It is not entirely clear why the former fighters have now taken to shaving off afros, but the hairstyles tend to be associated in conservative religious and social circles with people who are "deviant".

From the left: Machar, Kiir , Museveni and al Burhan pose in Entebbe after the extension of the pre-transitional period for 100 days on 7 Nov 2019 (Sovereign Council Photo)November 8, 2019 (JUBA) – The United States said disappointed by the failure of President Salva Kiir and his main peace partner Riek Machar to form the transitional government and called on the IGAD to establish benchmarks to assess peace implementation process.
On Thursday 7 November, Kiir and Machar agreed in a meeting held in Entebbe with the participation of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to extend the pre-transitional period for 100 days.
Machar refused the formation of the transitional government unless the two issues of the security arrangements and the state boundaries are resolved. He even went to warn that the ceasefire will be in jeopardy if the government is formed by November the 12th.
Kiir, for his part, is seen as seeking to maintain the status quo for the 28 states and refusing to disburse the funds needed for implementation of the costly security arrangements which will lead to form a unified army.
In a series of tweets on Friday, the Assistant Secretary for U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of African Affairs, Tibor Nagy said “Deeply disappointed” by the delay of the formation of the transitional government for more than three months.
“This inability to meet their own deadline calls into question their suitability to continue to lead the nation’s peace process,” he said.
He further called on the IGAD which brokered the peace agreement and oversees its implementation to work with the South Sudanese parties to set clear benchmarks for progress during an IGAD summit.
However, Nagy thanked the regional leaders of Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda for attempting to mediate between President Kiir and Machar.
The US top diplomat for Africa called on the parties to continue to observe the ceasefire which is the only positive result after five years of war and warned against promoting a return to the war.
“We must review our relationship with the government in light of the delay. The U.S. is considering all possible options to put pressure on those individuals who would impede peace and promote conflict,” he concluded.

Title: 21 Darfur displaced now detained for four months without trial - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
21 residents of Sortony camp for the displaced in Kabkabiya, North Darfur, who were detained four months ago, are still being held.
El Shafee Abdallah, the coordinator of Central Darfur camps, told Radio Dabanga that on August 12, a joint force of Rapid Support Force (RSF) militiamen and  a breakaway rebel group led by El Sadig Fakka detained 21 displaced people and moved them to the notorious Shala prison in El Fasher. The detainees include three teachers and five secondary school students, who have not been charged or brought to trial so far.
The detainees are accused of being affiliated with the Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW).
El Sadig Fakka group consists of a number of rebel combatants who recently split from the SLM-AW, the camp sheikh explained. “We think they wanted to prove their loyalty to the authorities by accusing the displaced in Sortony of supporting the rebels.”
He called on the authorities to release them or bring them to a fair trial.

Title: Sudan’s Journalists Face Continued Extortion and Censorship by National Security Agency — Global Issues
Global Issues
Social, Political, Economic and Environmental Issues That Affect Us All
Main menu:
You are here:
KHARTOUM, Nov 02 (IPS)  - The day before Amnesty International released a statement calling on the government of Sudan to end harassment harassment, intimidation and censorship of journalists following the arrests of at least 15 journalists since the beginning of the year, the head of the National Intelligence Security Services (NISS) Salah Goush accused Sudanese journalists, who recently met with western diplomats, of being spies.
Goush made the statement before parliament where he signed the code of conduct for journalists.
"They were called and interrogated to let them know that is a project of spying," said Goush to Sudan's parliamentarians on Thursday Nov. 1. He thenannounced that the NISS was dropping all complaints against the journalists.
But Amnesty International said in its statement issued today, Nov. 2, that "the Sudanese government have this year been unrelenting in their quest to silence independent media by arresting and harassing journalists and censoring both print and broadcast media."
"This just shows that Sudanese officials have not changed their ways- they still accuse journalists and activists of being spies and other trumped up accusations," Jehanne Henry, a researcher on Sudan and South Sudan at Human Rights Watch, told IPS about Goush's comments to parliament.
On Tuesday, a Reuters stringer in Khartoum and two other local journalists were questioned by the state security prosecutor about their earlier meetings with European Union diplomats and the United States' ambassador to Sudan.
At the time they were told that they might face charges when the investigation finishes. Prior to Tuesday, five other journalists were also interrogated for meeting the same diplomats  and the NISS states that two more journalists are to be questioned on the same matter.
"What NISS is doing with us is a form of extortion and it's a terror act to stop freedom of the press. Journalists have the right to meet diplomats, government officials and opposition and anyone else and they can talk to about freedom of speech or anything else. Journalists are not spies," Bahram Abdolmonim, one of the three journalists interrogated by NISS on Tuesday, told IPS. He added "journalism is a message".
Prior to Abdolmonim's  questioning three female and two male journalists were summoned to the NISS prosecutor's office and where questioned for meeting with western diplomats and discussing freedom of speech.
These are not the only incidents of clampdown against journalists. On Oct. 16 five journalists were arrested in front of the Sudanese parliament for protesting against the barring of one of their colleagues from parliament.
"Since the beginning of 2018 the government of Sudan, through its security machinery, has been unrelenting in its crackdown on press freedom by attacking journalists and media organisations," said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty international Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
Amnesty International also said that there was an increase in print censorship and that editors receive daily calls from NISS agents to question them about their editorial content. The editors have to then justify their storylines. NISS agents also show up at printing presses and either order editors to drop certain stories or confiscate entire print runs.
"Between May and October, the Al Jareeda newspaper was confiscated at least 13 times, Al Tayar was confiscated five times and Al Sayha four times. A host of other newspapers including Masadir, Al Ray Al Aam, Akhirlahza, Akhbar Al Watan, Al Midan, Al Garar and Al Mustuglia were each confiscated once or twice," the statement said.
Broadcast media have also been subjected to censorship. Earlier last month, NISS suspended a talk show on Sudania24 TV after it hosted Mohamed Hamdan, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, formerly the Janjaweed troops, who are accused of committing atrocities in Darfur.
Journalists' reporting is tightly restricted to only certain parts of the country, especially conflict zones like Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.
"The Sudanese authorities must stop this shameful assault on freedom of expression and let journalists do their jobs in peace. Journalism is not a crime" said Jackson.
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Sudan 174th out of 180 countries on its 2018 World Press Freedom Index, charging that the NISS "hounds journalists and censors the print media."
Journalists in Sudan are often arrested and taken to court where their face complaints that ranges from lying to defamation.
Amnesty International called on the Sudanese government to revise the Press and Printed Materials Act of 2009.
"We work in fear in here, when I write something I'm not sure if I will end up going to jail or being interrogated by the NISS," says one journalist who preferred to remain anonymous for fear of their safety.

Title: Rebels in Darfur accuse paramilitaries of arson - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdelwahid claimed that the Rapid Support Forces destroyed agricultural fields in Jebel Marra, following reports of clashes between the rebel forces and Sudan’s paramilitary forces.
The Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdelwahid claimed that the Rapid Support Forces destroyed agricultural fields in Jebel Marra, following reports of clashes between the rebel forces and Sudan’s paramilitary forces.
The SLM-AW has accused the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of burning crops in a number of villages in south-eastern Jebel Marra: around Feina, Kadineer and other areas. The rebels claim that the crops were destroyed “in order to starve the residents by using hunger as a weapon” after the recent fighting around Feina, Fujo, Kadineer, and Hillet Ateem.
The movement also said in a statement yesterday that the RSF has denied civilians access to markets in neighbouring villages which are under the control of the government, where people go to purchase their essential goods.
Mohamed El Nayer, SLM-AW spokesman: “[RSF], show the courage and honour of the war by confronting the Sudan Liberation Movement in the field instead of punishing unarmed civilians, burning and looting their property, while they have nothing to do with the war and fighting in Jebel Marra.
“We condemn these criminal acts and send a clear message to the United Nations, the Security Council, regional and international organisations and all those concerned with the defence of human rights to urgently act to stop these crimes against civilians and open an international investigation, uncover and hold accountable all the planners, instigators and perpetrators.”
On Sunday, the SLM-AW claimed the killing of 18 RSF troops in an attack led by government forces in the area of Feina.
Renewed fighting
On November 13, two children were killed and another was wounded in shelling by government forces stationed in Deribat area in the Jebel Marra area in South Darfur. The situation in the Deribat area was described as tense as previously civilians were reportedly killed by government troops and dozens were injured in anattack by the RSF, that same week.
Early November, the commander of the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti),vowed to eliminatethe Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdel Wahid Nur in Jebel Marra in three months. El Nur then accused the government of exploiting the declaration of a cease-fire for humanitarian reasons after the recentlandslides in Jebel Marra.
In Radio Dabanga’s ongoing reporting on therenewed heavy clashes in Darfur’s Jebel Marra, the SLM-AW was the only armed movement reported to be involved in the fighting. In August a United Nationspanel of independent experts on Sudanreported that the clashes, after nearly a year-long lull, have resulted in a “significant number of casualties on both sides and among civilians.”
The fighting in Jebel Marra has forced thousands to flee, with many taking refuge in caves and valleys with no access to food, water or proper shelter, the Panel of Experts confirmed. “The situation has been uniformly characterised as a dire humanitarian situation,” it said.

Title: IGAD orders S. Sudanese forces to vacate civilian areas - Sudan Tribune

Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
November 11, 2019 (ADDIS ABABA) – The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Council of Ministers has ordered all the South Sudanese military forces to immediately vacate civilian centres and populated areas.
The Council, in a communiqué of the 69th Extra-ordinary Session on the situation in South Sudan on Sunday, said they have noted with concern that some civilian centres are still being occupied by the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces (SSPDF) and armed opposition forces (SPLM/A-IO).
The Council also urged the incumbent Transitional Government of National Unity and opposition forces to be cantoned in barracks and cantonment sites respectively pursuant to the provisions of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS).
On Thursday last week, President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar agreed at a meeting held in Uganda, to delay key benchmarks in the peace accord by 100 days.
Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni chaired the meeting, also attended by the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Kenya’s Special Envoy to South Sudan, Kalonzo Musyoka.
The delay in forming a transitional national unity government by November 12 came after the main opposition group threatened to opt out of the deadline, saying the country’s security arrangements are incomplete.
The IGAD Council of ministers said they have noted that critical pending pre-transitional tasks crucial for the formation of the unity government, particularly relating to transitional security arrangements and determination of the number and boundaries of states, are still outstanding.
Meanwhile, the Council instructed IGAD’s Special Envoy for South Sudan, Ismail Wais in collaboration with Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC), the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM) and the African Union Commission to “urgently” organise a workshop for security mechanisms in Juba to agree on a roadmap with clear timeline for the implementation of Transitional Security Arrangements within 100 days extension.
“The Council emphasised the need to work on a roadmap and implementation plan to ensure the timely completion of pending pre-transitional tasks,” partly reads the communique.
South Sudan descended into civil war in mid-December 2013 when President Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of plotting a coup, allegations he dismissed.
In September last year, the country’s rival factions signed a revitalized peace deal to end the civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.
According to the 2018 peace deal, a unity government was supposed to be formed in May, but due to unresolved issues, the parties agreed to a six-month extension, settling on November 12.
At least 382,900 people died as a result of the conflict in the world’s youngest nation, a report published by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine revealed last year.

Attack
At least five civilians were reportedly killed by government troops and dozens were injured in an attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on civilians at the weekly Deribat market in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur on 12 November.
The motive behind the RSF attack appeared to be a reprisal on civilians after an ambush by the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) on Sunday in the area of Jawa, 10 kilometres south of Deribat, in which 17 government troops were reportedly killed and an RSF vehicle was destroyed.
Children killed

The blast killed five-year-old Salima Ibrahim Yahya and seven-year-old Abdel Karim Yahya Ahmed, and wounded another. The rest of the family were unhurt.
The commander of the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti), hasvowed to eliminate the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdel Wahid Nur in Jebel Marra in three months. The demand came in a statement followingHemeti’s recent visit to Zamzam camp for displaced people in North Darfur.
The general coordination of displaced people and refugee campscalled on the International Criminal Court (ICC) judges to include Hemeti on the list of those wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and to bring him to justice.

November 28, 2018:Everyone in Sudan assumes that next year President (dictator) Omar al Bashir will run for a seventh term. However, the economic decline that began last in 2017 has accelerated. The escalating economic crisis could become a political crisis that topples even an entrenched dictator like Bashir who has been in power for three decades. Moreover, 2019 looks rather dire. Inflation is increasing. Economic analysts think hyperinflation is a possibility. Bashir, of course, blames U.S. sanctions, but those are being relaxed. Bashir’s critics blame his regime’s mismanagement and corruption. Critics point to the 2017 North Islamic Bank embezzlement scandal as an example. At least $230 million was stolen. Sudan has also borrowed a lot of money. It currently owes somewhere between from $55 billion to $60 billion, roughly 120 percent of GDP. Sudan owes China at least $10 billion and is in no position to pay back the debt. The loss of oil income is certainly a major factor in Sudan’s economic decline. When South Sudan became independent, it got most of the oil fields (roughly 75 percent of Sudan’s oil production). However, Sudan still has the pipelines and major oil port (Port Sudan). The truth is, government mismanagement has contributed to the loss of oil and oil transport income. When oil prices were high Bashir’s regime didn’t spend the oil revenue on modernizing its industrial and agricultural sectors. It didn’t spend much on upgrading its oil service industry. Instead, Sudan spent the petrodollars on war (Darfur, civil war with southern Sudan) and military-related projects. A lot of government contracts went to businesses owned by government officials. Just how much is murky. At the moment the UN and EU estimate Sudan has around two million internally displaced people (many in the Darfur region and 900,000 refugees. About six million people are on the edge of starvation. In 2019 Sudan is supposed to have a national election. It could have another rebellion. (Austin Bay)
November 25, 2018: In northeast South Sudan (Bieh state), SPLM-IO accused government forces in neighboring Boma state of attacking an aid convoy. The government attack killed five people, all of them members of the Lou Nuer tribe. The attackers were Murle tribesmen
Egypt and Sudan have agreed to conduct joint military patrols. Both nations are concerned about spillover violence from Libya. The joint border forces will also combat terrorism and cross-border crimes.
November 24, 2018: South Africa announced it will invest one billion dollars in South Sudan's oil industry. The investment will include building a refinery in South Sudan. The three major foreign oil companies operating in South Sudan are China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Malaysia's Petronas oil company and India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.
November 23, 2018: In southern Sudan (South Kordofan state) UN officials met with the state Governor in an effort to improve the security for aid delivery in areas where SPLM-N rebels are active. The U.S. has made safe delivery of such aid one of its key requirements for removing Sudan from the state sponsor of terrorism list.
November 22, 2018: In northeast South Sudan (Upper Nile region), the UN is reinforcing its peacekeeping units. Internally displaced persons (IDPS) returning to their homes in several towns need extra protection.
In western Sudan (Darfur), SLM-AW rebels claim to have repulsed an attack by the government RSF (Rapid Support Forces) militia. The SLM-AW claimed it killed 14 militiamen and captured several weapons and motorcycles.
In South Sudan, IGAD (the East African Inter-Governmental Authority on Development) has decided to deploy 1,695 soldiers as part the Regional Protection Force (RPF). Here is the initial breakdown by country: 499 (each) from Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan. Somalia and Djibouti will each deploy 99 soldiers.
In Sudan, president-for-life Bashir complained that it is unfair for the U.S. to continue designating Sudan as a sponsor of state terrorism. He also said the remaining political and economic sanctions are unfair and unjust.
November 21, 2018: In Sudan, local media report that Port Sudan is experiencing a food, fuel and financial crisis. Specifically, the city and immediate area are facing a flour (bread flour) shortage. Diesel fuel is also scarce.
November 19, 2018: In South Sudan, SPLM-IO denied that its forces had attacked positions in Jubek state held by NAS-TC rebels.
November 17, 2018: In Sudan, the government revealed that the South Sudan president had met with the leaders of two Sudanese rebel factions belonging to SPLM-N in an effort to revive peace talks with the Sudan government. Since 2011 Sudan has been fighting with the SPLM-N in a part of southern Sudan as the Two Areas (Blue Nile and South Kordofan states).
November 16, 2018: In Ethiopia, ethnic conflict between Amhara and Tigray has sent 400 Ethiopian refugees into Sudan.
November 15, 2018: Despite earlier threats to leave, the UN agreed to keep its peacekeepers in the disputed Abyei border area until May 2019 claimed by Sudan and South Sudan. Both countries claim the area and peace is maintained by 4,500 Ethiopian peacekeepers, a force the UN can no longer afford. The new arrangement reduces the peacekeeper force by about 200 troops. This gives Sudan and South Sudan another six months to resolve the issue of who controls what in Abyei and its oil fields.
Sudan’s security prosecutor’s office issued arrest warrants for several opposition leaders. One of the leaders is Sadiq al-Mahdi, head of the National Umma Party (NUP). Al-Mahdi is currently in exile in Great Britain. The Sudan president is faced with growing popular opposition and fears that rival politicians are trying to unite and elect a new president.
November 10, 2018: In Yemen, Shia rebels announced that they have arrested several dozen Sudanese soldiers after a firefight near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.
November 9, 2018: In eastern South Sudan (Boma state), SPLM-IO rebels announced it has opened a safe access corridor for foreign aid shipments going to the Pibor area near the Ethiopian border.
November 8, 2018: Foreign NGOs (non-government organizations) accuse Sudan of systematically arresting and harassing reporters and censoring print and broadcast media outlets. From January to October 2018, fifteen journalists were arrested or detained by the government. On over two-dozen occasions the entire print runs of ten newspapers have been seized and confiscated by Sudanese security organizations.
November 7, 2018: The U.S. confirmed that it has discussed a plan with the Sudan government that would eventually lead to Sudan’s removal from the American “state sponsor of terrorism” list. Sudan has been on the list since August 1993. According to the U.S., Sudan’s government taken measures to combat terrorism, has begun opening foreign aid corridors in rebel-held areas, and is making an effort to reduce armed conflict within its borders. According to American and Sudanese foreign officials, Sudan must do six things before it will be removed from the terror sponsor list. It must (1) increase cooperation on counter-terrorism; (2) improve protections for freedom of the press and religion that Sudanese are already supposed to have; (3) assure foreign aid access; (4) end fighting with rebel groups and seek peace agreements; (5) demonstrate it no longer supports terrorism; (6) end cooperation with North Korea.
November 6, 2018: In Sudan, the commander of the government-backed Rapid Support Forces (RSF) internal security militia stated that the RSF will pursue “mercenaries” fighting for Sudanese rebel groups who operate from bases in Libya. In some cases, the Sudanese rebel groups have participated in Libya’s chaotic civil war. During the last week of October 2018 Sudanese rebels allegedly belonging to the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) participated in a firefight in the town of Zella (central Libya).

Title: Letter from Africa: Sudan's fashion police shave off afros - BBC News
In our series of letters from African journalists, Zeinab Mohammed Salih looks at the contentious issue of fashion in the conservative, Islamic country of Sudan.
In the last few weeks social media users in Sudan have beenhorrified by videos and pictures of young men's afros being shaved off,externalby the former Janjaweed forces in some of the poor areas of Khartoum, the capital.
The government-backed Janjaweed militia, accused ofcarrying out atrocities in the western region of Darfur in the early 2000s, now have a new role.
They were accused of riding camels and horses into villages seen as sympathetic to rebels, burning them to the ground, killing the men and raping the women.
Now renamed the Rapid Support Forces, they have been tasked with tracking down traffickers and stopping migrants heading to Europe - a role funded by the European Union (EU), althoughthe EU has denied that any money goes to the ex-Janjaweed,external.
It is not entirely clear why the former fighters have now taken to shaving off afros, but the hairstyles tend to be associated in conservative religious and social circles with people who are "deviant".
Dress is indeed a touchy subject in Sudan, where fashion can get you into trouble.
The actions of the former Janjaweed fighters reminded people of the Public Order Police, who often arrest and flog women for wearing what they see as indecent clothes, like trousers.
They also arrest tea ladies and other vulnerable women for working in public places.
The Public Order Police are controversial in Sudan, yet some Sudanese hold similarly conservative views on a women's position in society and how they should look.
They want to see women covering their heads and wearing long skirts or abayas - long black robes.
They were set up under the current regime of President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989. He brought back Sharia, or Islamic law, which had been suspended in 1985.
Amal Habbani, a rights activist with the group No to Women's Oppression, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper that between 43,000 and 50,000 women are arrested and flogged every year by public order police because of their clothing.
A few days before the afro outrage, opinion was divided on the way a former TV presenter and women's rights campaigner responded to a prominent imam and Islamic law scholar who said sexual harassment and child marriage could both be justified.
They were taking part in a debate on DW TV about what women in Sudan want.
We'am Shawogi told the imam that he should discuss things like equal pay instead of focusing on a woman's appearance, and that what was in a woman's wardrobe was her own choice.
Some people on social media were angered at what they saw as Ms Shawogi's disrespectful attitude towards the imam - but others said her tone reflected the frustration many women feel about what they see as an outdated outlook.

In the wake of the TV debate, Ms Shawogi received death threats from Sudanese men on social media for expressing her forthright opinion.
The 28-year-old, who also runs a cafe that has been a hub for artists and musicians in Khartoum, had to go into hiding.
The debate has not tempered the actions of the Public Order Police, who last month arrested singer Mona Magdi Salim after people shared pictures of her on social media singing at a concert in Khartoum wearing trousers.
She has been charged with dressing indecently and faces punishment by flogging if found guilty.
According to a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey last year, Sudan was one of the five worst countries when it came to women's rights in the Arab world - coming 17th out of 22.
This chimes with a 2016  Human Rights Watch reportthat notes that the Sudanese security forces have used sexual violence, intimidation and other forms of abuse to silence female human rights defenders,externalacross the country.
Winni Omer is a journalist and rights campaigner who is another example of a vocal woman in Sudan facing persecution.
She was arrested last year while walking on the street with her friends for wearing indecent clothing - although she was wearing a long skirt at the time. In the end, she was found not guilty.

A few months later, the police arrested her again, with others, while visiting her friend. They were all accused of being prostitutes and banned from travelling outside the country.
After spending the past year or so in and out of court, Ms Omer managed get permission last month to leave the country for her postgraduate studies in human rights abroad. Her case is still pending.
The long history of the Public Order Police in Sudan shows that the establishment is afraid of any form of change, regarding it as a threat to their authority.
Now it seems that young men expressing their individuality by wearing afros, dreadlocks or low-hanging trousers may also be facing the same fate as women who have been humiliated for years for wanting to break with Islamic and Arabic traditions.

Title: Transitional Sudan in security threat: How threatful are the deep-state forces? - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
By T. A. Ali
T. A. AliIt will be premature, impractical and perhaps naive to think that Sudan’s ongoing revolutionary change is free from security threats. Such thinking can be a recipe for a  tragic mistake. My view is that the situation is more complicated and volatile and calls for caution.
Indeed this is a  brave and popular upheaval, with a remarkable trademark of “peacefulness”, championed and defended by a young and determined generation. They brilliantly were able to concisely sum up the core, fundamental popular demands in a thematical slogan of “Freedom, Peace and Justice”.
However, considering the magnitude of hostility and the capacity of the counter-revolutionary forces, especially the Islamist “deep state” security, my view is that the arrangements for effecting change generated by the process would obviously need a more institutionalized guarding system and strong protection mechanism than the prevailing one.
It is important to note that, though it passed through an unprecedented heroic, life lesson torment, the revolution has obviously been unable to pull the security forces, including the army, especially the upper echelon, into its side or fold. The primary reason for this failure is the heavy-handed grip exercised by the decades-old Islamist deep state system over the entire security apparatus.
For certain, if this trend of developments continue unfettered, it will go beyond mere alteration or adjustment of the context and essence of the changes, but will have serious repercussions on the integrity and viability of the changing process and might even generate unpredicted repercussions and undermine every efforts employed to dismantle Islamist deep state and neutralize its counter-revolutionary force.
Make no mistake the deep state elements who are still in effective control of every essential and vital aspect in the state machinery including almost the entire security apparatus, the economy, banking system, the energy, communication and transportation industry, foreign missions, civil service and above all propping up the militia. Failure to dismantle the powerful Islamist state will surely obstruct the attainment of any durable peace, security and stability. Consequently, such a situation might even put into risk or jeopardise prospects of maintaining the “unity” of the country itself.
The polarized arrangements have produced a non-ideal situation where the civilian government finds itself encountered by the deep state counter-revolutionary forces, turning the possibility of establishing freedoms, achieving genuine peace and executing justice into a near-impossible expectation. The crucial question is, therefore: how threatful the threat of the deep state forces in torpedoing any meaningful progress of transitional changes?
For certain it is no secret of the fact that security always serves an essential political defence shell and determining catalyst factor in effecting orderly transitional process in unstable revolutionary environments such as the one taking place in Sudan now.
At the same time, while one would have had expected otherwise, it is surprising to note the prevailing level of indifference, the degree of lack of interest and concern, the kind of half-heartedness and lukewarm, the sort of aloofness, the extent of insensitivity, callous and lethargic attitudes being displayed by the civilian government, the leading force behind the revolution (the FFC) and even the grassroots of the local resistance committees regarding this situation.
It is important to recall for public attention that barely a month before the formation of the civilian government, the demised Transitional Military Council (TMC) did announce an attempted coup led by no other person than the Army Chief of Staff who also dared to tell in a publicized interrogation that he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood ever since he was a youngster at school. He also mentioned his contacts while preparing his failed coup. Among those are well known leading figures of the defunct regime. Astonishingly they were never arrested nor interrogated.In that announcement, the TMC stated that five other previous coup attempts were aborted.
In examining this issue, it is of paramount importance to recall the fact that, if the security agency had not been summarily dissolved under the 1985 revolutionary transitional arrangements, in arbitrarily, reckless and unprofessional manner, the destiny of the country could have been a different story.
The inner side of the existing security institutions reveals the picture that is negative enough to inflict any degree of damage to the changing process. It is full of time bombs and landmines.
The reality is that the Islamist defunct regime, in order to ensure and secure the loyalty of the security apparatus, had significantly ideologized, indoctrinated, tribalized and privatized the entire security system including the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), the People’s Defence Force (PDF), the People’s Security Force (PSF), the Police and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
This is what makes these institutions loyal to counter-revolutionary forces of the Islamist deep-state.
For example, in the case of SAF, in addition to its already disputed public reputation on the ground of multiple accusations including its constant engagement in coercing and suppressing internal civil wars, intervening in making coups, aborting democratic processes and allying with despotic regimes in times of popular protests for freedoms, it is virtually a collapsed institution with no clear or proper chain of command. This is of course not forgetting the indifference it had shown during the massacre of hundreds of civilians who mistakenly thought to seek protection from the army and camped in no other place than in front of the Army Command Headquarters.
This state of affairs as at now could be easily manipulated and exploited in sabotaging any meaningful changing process, especially as SAF’s upper echelon is thoroughly infiltrated.
The case with the NISS is in no way better than that of the other partisan security organs such as the People Defence Forces and Popular Security Forces which are sponsored and commanded by National Congress Party hardliners such as  Ali Osman Taha (the former vice president), Ali Karty (a hardliner security don), Ahmed Haroun (ICC indicted), Awad Abujaz, Nafi Ali Nafi and others.
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the militia currently imposing itself as Sudan’s de facto army has its unique reputation problem and negative public perception over its composition and human rights record.
As an ethnic-based tribal militia with records of violations of human rights, and consisting of elements whose identity remained doubtful, it can hardly be relied on for protection of any democratic dispensation.
As for the police, it is now not a reliable law enforcement institution either. Apart from the corruption that eroded and smeared its ranks, and human rights violations committed through what is known as Public Order law, the police have become a powerless and unreliable force for the last thirty years. It needs thorough structural reform.
To make things worse, the sharply negotiated and controversial transitional documents, especially the Constitutional Declaration, have explicitly given the military exclusive rights on the issue of the restructuration of the security sector, including the army, the police and the rest of the security apparatus. This exclusive right also includes the appointment of ministers of Defence and Interior.
Another worst situation is the case of the manipulated Judiciary system which is too deformed to be reformed.
This is quite obvious from the fight and stalemate where was the Civilian government is unable to force any reforms as its hands are tied with procedural difficulties over the appointment of the Chief Justice and the Attorney General. This is a very crucial and relevant matter to security sector reforms as both the Chief Justice and the Attorney have direct roles in effecting justice and curbing impunity to enhance and complement security.
The unrestricted and free movement enjoyed by the deep state prominent elements such as security operatives, renegade army Generals, militia commanders, and political leaders will definitely facilitate them regrouping, planning and executing any possible plots. They are effectively outside government control and moving with unlimited resources including money and numerous relations with international quarters. Their free movement will, by all means, help complete the ring of plotters and saboteurs and fill the missing links of conspiratorial chains.
The danger of the free movement of the officials of the defunct regime was already manifested in other cases and incidences. The recent attempt to smuggle the deposed president Gen. Omer Albasheer out of his prison, the minor nature of accusations levelled against him, a mock trial he is going and the provocative way of his dress before the court all clearly demonstrate the fragility of the security situation.
Besides the above-mentioned challenges, there is also the need for additional precautions since there are other factors that may not work in favour of the changing process. Divergences and often conflicting interests and views of international actors remain one such negative salient complications especially as some actors are clearly against any favourable democratic dispensation to occur in Sudan. This will influence the end game of the changing process in an adversary way.
Furthermore, the ambivalent and sometimes objectional positions adopted by some FFC leaders towards peacemaking processes in war-affected regions such as Darfur and the two areas also does not help to positively address this issue of security threat. These leaders should know peace is an existential matter.
Any ambivalent positions displayed will tighten the hands of the civilian government, reduces the chances for the achievement of this vital issue and hinders the progress. Such behaviour can also cause bad blood between the civilian government and people in these war-affected areas and unnecessarily widen the gap of trust and shrink the necessary support. This will work in favour of counter-revolutionary forces.
Another worth mentioning point in this regard is the existing gap and lack of good understanding within the ranks of the forces for change. Though it is easier for them to cement their ranks, the reality is not that comfortable. The fact is that the existing fragmentation among these forces is fairly baseless especially within the main building blocks such as the Sudan Professional Association (SPA), Sudan Call (SC), National Consensus Forces (NCF) and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF). Although they all are signatories to the charter for Freedom and Change, they are yet to be at the required level of understanding, cooperation and harmony. The point is that the more these forces are fragmented, the more the chances for the counter-revolutionary forces increase and the threat becomes imminent.
In assessing this potential situation it should also be noted with great concern the most recent and unprecedented political phenomenon took place in Eastern Sudan (the Beja land) where severe tribal clashes took place which was followed by demonstrations staged to call for a separation of the East. This is a new trend and the Islamist element can utilize such grievances.
The civilian government should approach and contain such developments before it spills over.
Another vital frontal arena used to attack the changing process is religion. Islamist elements are desperately trying to use this sensitive front as a conduit for their propaganda against the forces for change. In preparation for concerted psychological war, the defunct Islamist propaganda is carefully launching attacks against the whole change taking place as masonic and/or communist conspiracy. Many well known clergymen, Mosque preachers, Islamist media operators, writers, cartoonists and caricaturists are consistently and deliberately employing character assassination tactics, targeting and labelling political leaders, prominent national figures, women, civil society activists of the revolution and civilian government ministers as communists and/or irresponsible liberals who give no regard to religious and sacred beliefs.
Although many Sudanese consider this as mere malicious propaganda schemes by desperate Islamists who recklessly used and exploited Islam as cover-up to commit  unimaginable and organized corruption  which made them lose credibility on the eyes of the public regarding their piety or commitment to religious matters, it is important this propaganda should not be let go without countering or deterrence. Such countering can best be played by moderate religious leaders who support the change.
In the face of this security challenge; definitely, the answer will not be “hands up” or “raising white flag”.
All defensive means and ways need to be employed to find a way out from this “boxed in” situation. Hard achievements and gains need hard ways to be defended. Besides public awareness and mobilization the government needs to be bold enough and marshall all resources means and ways to protect itself including effecting necessary security arrangements that allow the protection of the changing process.Achieving comprehensive peace is one strategic sure way to secure stability and it should be a must. Perhaps it may be wiser to also suggest the necessity of appeasing and neutralizing international actors, especially those that have direct interests,  particularly the neighbouring countries such as Egypt, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and South Sudan, to play more positive roles in Sudan’s political settlements. This is important in that their interests lie in a new, stable and democratic Sudan and their leverage should be used for change and stability rather than otherwise.
At the level of the wider international community, the role of the United States, the UK, France, the Arab countries, the UN, AU is instrumental especially in assisting the civilian government in the area of the peace process, economic recovery and relief assistance.
It is always said vigilance is the gate to minimise and/or eliminate the chances for a security threat. In the case of Sudan that takes both public mobilization and international support.
The important note down here is that the best way to break this “boxed in” situation is not by way of mere folly reaction but by way of “rationalization”.
With all the accumulated experiences from October 1964 revolution and April 1985 revolution, plus all the hard lessons learnt out of the oppressive conservative military rules, including the genocide and war crimes, it is high time for Sudan to draw such important lessons that will help break this Devilish vicious cycle of revolution, military coups, popular uprising, shaky transitional arrangements, weak civilian government, military coups and then revolution again.
It is said, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

Title: Transitional Sudan in security threat: How threatful are the deep-state forces? - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
By T. A. Ali
T. A. AliIt will be premature, impractical and perhaps naive to think that Sudan’s ongoing revolutionary change is free from security threats. Such thinking can be a recipe for a  tragic mistake. My view is that the situation is more complicated and volatile and calls for caution.
Indeed this is a  brave and popular upheaval, with a remarkable trademark of “peacefulness”, championed and defended by a young and determined generation. They brilliantly were able to concisely sum up the core, fundamental popular demands in a thematical slogan of “Freedom, Peace and Justice”.
However, considering the magnitude of hostility and the capacity of the counter-revolutionary forces, especially the Islamist “deep state” security, my view is that the arrangements for effecting change generated by the process would obviously need a more institutionalized guarding system and strong protection mechanism than the prevailing one.
It is important to note that, though it passed through an unprecedented heroic, life lesson torment, the revolution has obviously been unable to pull the security forces, including the army, especially the upper echelon, into its side or fold. The primary reason for this failure is the heavy-handed grip exercised by the decades-old Islamist deep state system over the entire security apparatus.
For certain, if this trend of developments continue unfettered, it will go beyond mere alteration or adjustment of the context and essence of the changes, but will have serious repercussions on the integrity and viability of the changing process and might even generate unpredicted repercussions and undermine every efforts employed to dismantle Islamist deep state and neutralize its counter-revolutionary force.
Make no mistake the deep state elements who are still in effective control of every essential and vital aspect in the state machinery including almost the entire security apparatus, the economy, banking system, the energy, communication and transportation industry, foreign missions, civil service and above all propping up the militia. Failure to dismantle the powerful Islamist state will surely obstruct the attainment of any durable peace, security and stability. Consequently, such a situation might even put into risk or jeopardise prospects of maintaining the “unity” of the country itself.
The polarized arrangements have produced a non-ideal situation where the civilian government finds itself encountered by the deep state counter-revolutionary forces, turning the possibility of establishing freedoms, achieving genuine peace and executing justice into a near-impossible expectation. The crucial question is, therefore: how threatful the threat of the deep state forces in torpedoing any meaningful progress of transitional changes?
For certain it is no secret of the fact that security always serves an essential political defence shell and determining catalyst factor in effecting orderly transitional process in unstable revolutionary environments such as the one taking place in Sudan now.
At the same time, while one would have had expected otherwise, it is surprising to note the prevailing level of indifference, the degree of lack of interest and concern, the kind of half-heartedness and lukewarm, the sort of aloofness, the extent of insensitivity, callous and lethargic attitudes being displayed by the civilian government, the leading force behind the revolution (the FFC) and even the grassroots of the local resistance committees regarding this situation.
It is important to recall for public attention that barely a month before the formation of the civilian government, the demised Transitional Military Council (TMC) did announce an attempted coup led by no other person than the Army Chief of Staff who also dared to tell in a publicized interrogation that he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood ever since he was a youngster at school. He also mentioned his contacts while preparing his failed coup. Among those are well known leading figures of the defunct regime. Astonishingly they were never arrested nor interrogated.In that announcement, the TMC stated that five other previous coup attempts were aborted.
In examining this issue, it is of paramount importance to recall the fact that, if the security agency had not been summarily dissolved under the 1985 revolutionary transitional arrangements, in arbitrarily, reckless and unprofessional manner, the destiny of the country could have been a different story.
The inner side of the existing security institutions reveals the picture that is negative enough to inflict any degree of damage to the changing process. It is full of time bombs and landmines.
The reality is that the Islamist defunct regime, in order to ensure and secure the loyalty of the security apparatus, had significantly ideologized, indoctrinated, tribalized and privatized the entire security system including the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), the People’s Defence Force (PDF), the People’s Security Force (PSF), the Police and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
This is what makes these institutions loyal to counter-revolutionary forces of the Islamist deep-state.
For example, in the case of SAF, in addition to its already disputed public reputation on the ground of multiple accusations including its constant engagement in coercing and suppressing internal civil wars, intervening in making coups, aborting democratic processes and allying with despotic regimes in times of popular protests for freedoms, it is virtually a collapsed institution with no clear or proper chain of command. This is of course not forgetting the indifference it had shown during the massacre of hundreds of civilians who mistakenly thought to seek protection from the army and camped in no other place than in front of the Army Command Headquarters.
This state of affairs as at now could be easily manipulated and exploited in sabotaging any meaningful changing process, especially as SAF’s upper echelon is thoroughly infiltrated.
The case with the NISS is in no way better than that of the other partisan security organs such as the People Defence Forces and Popular Security Forces which are sponsored and commanded by National Congress Party hardliners such as  Ali Osman Taha (the former vice president), Ali Karty (a hardliner security don), Ahmed Haroun (ICC indicted), Awad Abujaz, Nafi Ali Nafi and others.

The National Disarmament Committee has called on those possessing illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles in Sudan to promptly hand them over to responsible authorities before the beginning of the forced collection phase which is due to begin next week.
The Committee's rapporteur, Ahmed El Naw, confirmed that work during the next phase would continue with the same mandate and strength with which the collection began.
He pointed out that Land Cruisers that have illegally entered the country will be subject to the new Customs Act, which will be activated next week.
He said that some 1329 vehicles have been registered in Darfur since the campaign began. More vehicles are to be registered next week.
Disarmament campaign
Last year in July, the Sudanese government announced alarge disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone, more than12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.
The phase of the voluntary handover of weapons ended and compulsory collection began in end October. By then,about 30,000 weapons had been collected, out of an estimated 700,000 illegal weapons circulating in Darfur.
In November 2017, the commander of RSF, deployed more forces for its disarmament campaign in Darfur. This was followed by a re-enforcement campaign in May 2018, announced by the Sudan’s second vice-president.

Title: S. Sudan activist urges release of peace implementation funds - Sudan Tribune

Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
November 17, 2019 (JUBA) – South Sudan’s incumbent government should urgently release the remaining portion of the $100 million it pledged for the implementation of the country’s revitalized peace agreement, an activist said on Monday.
South Sudanese civil society activist Edmund Yakani (The Niles/File)In a statement extended toSudan Tribune, Edmund Yakani said the start of the 100 days agreed by the parties for the pre-transitional period extension is not encouraging in terms of the parties demonstrating actions of commitment towards speedy implementation of the remaining critical pending tasks.
“At least by one week for the 100 days some actions that require no funds should have delivered. Normally, the beginning of an extended period starts with silence from the all parties. This is experiences of the first extended period of six months for the pre-transitional period,” said Yakani.
On November 7, South Sudan President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar agreed at a meeting in Uganda to delay key benchmarks in the peace deal by 100 days.
Ugadan’s President Yoweri Museveni chaired the meeting, also attended by the head of Sudan’s Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Kenya’s Special Envoy to South Sudan, Kalonzo Musyoka.
The delay in forming a national unity government came after Machar’s group threatened to boycott November 12 deadline, saying the security arrangements were incomplete.
But Yakani said within the first one week, actions such as renewal of directives to the forces to report to cantonment sites and barracks, release of part of the $100 million and ordering forces to vacate civilians’ centers, among others should have been witnessed among parties to the accord.
“Committing political will to implement the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is essential from the principals of the parties’ signatories to the peace agreement. Trust and confidence of the principals of the parties for working together is the primary determinant for genuine implementation of the R-ARCSS,” stressed the activist.
He urged the regional bloc (IGAD) to expedite the facilitation of the required political leadership retreat for the parties to peace agreement.
“Failure or inadequate performance during the first 50 days of the extended pre-transitional period on deliverance of the critical pending issues of the peace agreement will be a bad reputation for the parties and IGAD,” noted Yakani.
The United States on Wednesday said it was “gravely disappointed” with South Sudan’s failure to form a Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) by a November 12 deadline and would “reevaluate” its relationship with the young nation.
Also, several US officials, including the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, have slammed Entebbe agreement saying this second extension “calls into question their suitability to continue to lead the nation”.
South Sudan descended into civil war in mid-December 2013 when President Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of plotting a coup, allegations he dismissed.
In September last year, the country’s rival factions signed a revitalized peace deal to end the civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.

21 residents of Sortony camp for the displaced in Kabkabiya, North Darfur, who were detained four months ago, are still being held.
21 residents of Sortony camp for the displaced in Kabkabiya, North Darfur, who were detained four months ago, are still being held.
El Shafee Abdallah, the coordinator of Central Darfur camps, told Radio Dabanga that on August 12, a joint force of Rapid Support Force (RSF) militiamen and  a breakaway rebel group led by El Sadig Fakka detained 21 displaced people and moved them to the notorious Shala prison in El Fasher. The detainees include three teachers and five secondary school students, who have not been charged or brought to trial so far.
The detainees are accused of being affiliated with the Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW).
El Sadig Fakka group consists of a number of rebel combatants who recently split from the SLM-AW, the camp sheikh explained. “We think they wanted to prove their loyalty to the authorities by accusing the displaced in Sortony of supporting the rebels.”
He called on the authorities to release them or bring them to a fair trial.

Title: RSF ‘reprisal attack’ on South Darfur market – civilians killed, beaten, robbed - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
At least five civilians were reportedly killed by government troops and dozens were injured in an attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on civilians at the weekly Deribat market in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur on Monday.
At least five civilians were reportedly killed by government troops and dozens were injured in an attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on civilians at the weekly Deribat market in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur on Monday.
The motive behind the RSF attack appeared to be a reprisal on civilians after an ambush by the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) on Sunday in the area of Jawa, 10 kilometres south of Deribat, in which 17 government troops were reportedly killed and an RSF vehicle was destroyed.
Witnesses from Deribat told Radio Dabanga that the militia, after withdrawing from Jawa, attacked the market and opened fire, killing five people and injuring dozens.
Witnesses confirmed that the government militia forces also attacked the market, where they beat shoppers and traders and looted their goods.
Witnesses confirmed that the government forces also shelled south and west of Deribat with heavy weapons, wounding seven civilians.
Witnesses described the situation in the area and other parts of East Jebel Marra as tense.
RSF
As reported by Radio Dabanga last week, the commander of the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti),vowed to eliminate the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdel Wahid Nur in Jebel Marra in three months. The demand came in a statement followingHemeti’s recent visit to Zamzam camp for displaced people in North Darfur.
On Monday the general coordination of displaced people and refugee campscalled on the International Criminal Court (ICC) judges to include Hemeti on the list of those wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and to bring him to justice.

♦ Rebels 'repel government militia attacks' in Darfur's Jebel Marra
November 27 – 2018 FEINA Rebels of the Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdelwahid claimed that the Rapid Support Forces destroyed agricultural fields in Jebel Marra, following reported clashes between the rebel forces and Sudan’s paramilitary forces on Saturday.
SLM-AW fighters said they responded to an attack in Feina in south-eastern Jebel Marra that day, confirming that they are sure that 18 RSF militiamen were killed and 18 others wounded. Yesterday the rebels accused RSF troops of burning crops in a number of villages in south-eastern Jebel Marra, “in order to starve the residents by using hunger as a weapon”. Radio Dabanga was not yet able to corroborate the claim.
Last week Sudanese military forces attacked SLM-AW rebels inTibein in northern Jebel Marra. Early November, the commander of the RSF vowed to eliminate the SLM-AW in Jebel Marra in three months. There has been no official reaction from the Sudanese armed forces or the official spokesman about what is happening on the ground and there have been no confirmed reports yet of displacements.

♦ Draft peace pre-negotiation deal signed by Darfuri rebel groups
November 26 – 2018 ADDIS ABABA Two non-signatory rebel groups, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Movement faction headed by Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), signed a pre-negotiation agreement draft after proposing the amendment to remove the words ‘Darfur’ and ‘Sudan’ from the Doha Document for Peace on Friday.
Their signature signalled the end of a two-day series of meetings which discussed the future of the peace process in Darfur and the obstacles that stand before it. It is understood by Radio Dabanga that this amendment was made because the two parties do not wish to talk about the problems of Darfur or Sudan, but to talk about issues of democracy, economy and so forth which emanate from Khartoum.
If the government approves this along with a cessation of hostilities for humanitarian purposes which sets the negotiating agenda, the parties will enter into negotiations. Yesterday Dr Amin Omer, who is the chief negotiator of the Darfur peace file that was first signed in 2011, has confirmed the readiness of the government to resume negotiations with the Darfur movements.
The African Union High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) now prepares a meeting with theSudan Call alliance of opposition partiesin Ethiopia next month.

Title: Sudan’s Journalists Face Continued Extortion and Censorship by National Security Agency | Inter Press Service
Thursday, August 29, 2024

KHARTOUM, Nov 2 2018  (IPS)- The day before Amnesty International released a statement calling on the government of Sudan to end harassment, intimidation and censorship of journalists following the arrests of at least 15 journalists since the beginning of the year, the head of the National Intelligence Security Services (NISS) Salah Goush accused Sudanese journalists, who recently met with western diplomats, of being spies.
Goush made the statement before parliament where he signed the code of conduct for journalists.Related IPS ArticlesDon’t “Whitewash” Khashoggi’s MurderWhen Being ‘Offensive’ or ‘Morally Improper’ Online Carries an Indeterminate Jail Sentence in East AfricaAfrican Governments Mark World Press Freedom Day with Crackdown Against Online Journalism
“They were called and interrogated to let them know that this [meeting with Western diplomats] is a project of spying,” said Goush to Sudan’s parliamentarians on Thursday Nov. 1. He thenannounced that the NISS was dropping all complaints against the journalists.
But Amnesty International said in its statement issued today, Nov. 2, that “the Sudanese government have this year been unrelenting in their quest to silence independent media by arresting and harassing journalists and censoring both print and broadcast media.”
“This just shows that Sudanese officials have not changed their ways- they still accuse journalists and activists of being spies and other trumped up accusations,” Jehanne Henry, a researcher on Sudan and South Sudan at Human Rights Watch, told IPS about Goush’s comments to parliament.
On Tuesday, a Reuters stringer in Khartoum and two other local journalists were questioned by the state security prosecutor about their earlier meetings with European Union diplomats and the United States’ ambassador to Sudan.
At the time they were told that they might face charges when the investigation is completed. Prior to Tuesday, five other journalists were also interrogated for meeting the same diplomats and the NISS stated that two more journalists were to be questioned on the same matter.
“What the NISS is doing to us is a form of extortion and it’s a terror act to stop freedom of the press. Journalists have the right to meet diplomats, government officials and opposition and anyone else and they can talk to about freedom of speech or anything else. Journalists are not spies,” Bahram Abdolmonim, one of the three journalists interrogated by the NISS on Tuesday, told IPS. He added “journalism is a message”.
Prior to Abdolmonim’s questioning three female and two male journalists were summoned to the NISS prosecutor’s office and where questioned for meeting with western diplomats and discussing freedom of speech.
These are not the only incidents of clampdown against journalists. On Oct. 16 five journalists were arrested in front of the Sudanese parliament for protesting against the barring of one of their colleagues from parliament.
“Since the beginning of 2018 the government of Sudan, through its security machinery, has been unrelenting in its crackdown on press freedom by attacking journalists and media organisations,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty international Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
Amnesty International also said that there was an increase in print censorship and that editors receive daily calls from NISS agents to question them about their editorial content. The editors have to then justify their storylines. NISS agents also show up at printing presses and either order editors to drop certain stories or confiscate entire print runs.
“Between May and October, the Al Jareeda newspaper was confiscated at least 13 times, Al Tayar was confiscated five times and Al Sayha four times. A host of other newspapers including Masadir, Al Ray Al Aam, Akhirlahza, Akhbar Al Watan, Al Midan, Al Garar and Al Mustuglia were each confiscated once or twice,” the statement said.
Broadcast media have also been subjected to censorship. Earlier last month, NISS suspended a talk show on Sudania24 TV after it hosted Mohamed Hamdan, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, formerly the Janjaweed troops, who are accused of committing atrocities in Darfur.
Across the country reporting is tightly restricted. Conflict zones like Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan states, are especially difficult to report from.
“The Sudanese authorities must stop this shameful assault on freedom of expression and let journalists do their jobs in peace. Journalism is not a crime,” said Jackson.
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Sudan 174th out of 180 countries on its 2018 World Press Freedom Index, charging that the NISS “hounds journalists and censors the print media.”
Journalists in Sudan are often arrested and taken to court where they face complaints that range from lying to defamation.
Amnesty International called on the Sudanese government to revise the Press and Printed Materials Act of 2009.
“We work in fear in here, when I write something I’m not sure if I will end up going to jail or be interrogated by the NISS,” one journalist who preferred to remain anonymous for fear of their safety told IPS.

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Two children were killed and another was wounded in shelling by government forces stationed in Deribat area in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur.
Two children were killed and another was wounded in shelling by government forces stationed in Deribat area in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur.
A relative of one of the of the dead children told Radio Dabanga that the government troops stationed in Deribat area fired an explosive projectile on Tuesday evening that fell on a family who were having dinner at a farm east of Deribat. The blast killed five-year-old Salima Ibrahim Yahya and seven-year-old Abdel Karim Yahya Ahmed, and wounded another. The rest of the family were unhurt.
He said that as a result of the shelling, a fire broke out on the farm and destroyed agricultural crops over an area of two acres.
Reprisal attack
The situation in the Deribat area has been described as tense. As previously reported by Radio Dabanga, at least five civilians were reported killed by government troops and dozens were injured in anattack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on civilians at the weekly Deribat market in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur on Monday.
The motive behind the RSF attack appeared to be a reprisal on civilians after an ambush by the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) on Sunday in the area of Jawa, 10 kilometres south of Deribat, in which 17 government troops were reportedly killed and an RSF vehicle was destroyed.
RSF
As reported by Radio Dabanga last week, the commander of the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti),vowed to eliminate the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdel Wahid Nur in Jebel Marra in three months. The demand came in a statement followingHemeti’s recent visit to Zamzam camp for displaced people in North Darfur.
The general coordination of displaced people and refugee campscalled on the International Criminal Court (ICC) judges to include Hemeti on the list of those wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and to bring him to justice.

Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Sudan Liberation Movement of Abdelwahid El Nur leadership (SLM-AW) has announced the alleged killing of 18 members of the government Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in an attack led by government forces in the area of Feina in south-eastern Jebel Marra in Darfur on Saturday.
The Sudan Liberation Movement of Abdelwahid El Nur leadership (SLM-AW) has announced the alleged killing of 18 members of the government Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in an attack led by government forces in the area of Feina in south-eastern Jebel Marra in Darfur on Saturday.
Abdelgader Gadoura, commander-in-chief of the SLM-AW, reported that “the attack was carried out by 400 troops backed up by 18 armoured vehicles with long-range bombers.”
According to Gadoura, although the SLM-AW has declared a ceasefire, the regime has continued to breach the agreement. He said that SLM-AW fighters responded to the attack, confirming that they are sure that 18 RSF militiamen were killed and 18 others wounded.
The announcement added that more than 40 people had been taken to Kass and Nyala hospitals. An unarmed civilian was allegedly wounded in the leg during the attack and taken to hospital in the liberated territories.
Fighting elsewhere
Fighting also erupted between the SLM-AW forces and RSF troops in southern Jebel Marra on Saturday, near the villages of Sina, Karo, and Sobun El Fagur. This resulted in the death of one civilian while two others were injured.
According to residents, 37-year-old Mohamed Yahya was shot dead, and Adam Shogar and Kalsoum Ibrahim sustained bullet wounds while fleeing Sina village during the clashes between the two sides.
They added that this fighting forced residents to flee from their homes to the valleys and the mountain caves.
There has been no official reaction from the Sudanese armed forces or the official spokesman about what is really happening in Jebel Marra.
Peace negotiations
SLM-AW founder and leader Abdelwahid El Nur hasrefused to join peace negotiationsuntil Khartoum has restored stability and security in Darfur.
The holdout leader El Nur, whose faction resolutely refuses to enter into talks or negotiations with the Khartoum government, reaffirmed that “the movement [SLM-AW] is continuing its struggle against the National Congress government in its steadfast positions of disarming the government’s militias, demanding compensation individually and collectively for the victims, and addressing the roots of the Sudanese crisis with equal citizenship, separation of religion and state, liberalism, and rule of law. All this must be done before talking about peace.”
At the beginning of November, the commander of the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti),vowed to eliminate the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdel Wahid Nur in Jebel Marrawithin three months.
