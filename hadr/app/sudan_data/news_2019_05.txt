Two people were shot dead and two others, including a minor, wounded in attacks by gunmen in Tawila locality in North Darfur on Saturday. Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) government militia reportedly prevented farmers from reaching their farms.
A relative of one of the dead men told Radio Dabanga that the incident was carried out by eight gunmen wearing military uniforms and riding camels, on Saturday evening near the village of Tordi, 10 kilometres east of Khazan Tunjur.
He said the gunmen opened fire, killing Abdelrasoul Ali Saleh and Adam Yagoub Ali and wounded 12-year-old Ahmed Yagoub. They then stole 45 head of cattle.
The relative pointed out that the residents reported the incident to the garrison of the army at Murtal, but no one came out to pursue the culprits.
Nomad settlement
A witness told Radio Dabanga that In a separate incident on Sunday evening, a group of gunmen wearing military uniforms opened fire on a nomad settlement in the area of Falluja, south of Dubo El Omda in Tawila locality.
Mahjoub Suleiman was shot in the leg. The witness said the gunmen then stole 17 head of cattle.
Farmers reported to Radio Dabanga from Dubo El Omda that members of theRSF, some of them driving a Land Cruiser and others on camels, prevented farmers from reaching their farms around the village on Monday morning. They threatened to shoot anyone who does not abide by their order.
Hemeti
As reported by Radio Dabanga last week, the commander the RSF, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamadan (aka Hemeti), who is also deputy chairman of the ruling Transitional Military Council, cautioned the RSF to abide by discipline, stressing that they were being subjected to “a campaign of defamation”.
He said: “Attacks on civilians are forbidden. I know the RSF is a disciplined force, and anyone who commits a crime or an offense will immediately be disqualified and brought to justice”.
Sudan’s main militia
TheRSF militia was created in 2013to fight rebel movements throughout Sudan.
In January 2015, aconstitutional amendmentgave the militia the status of ‘regular force’. Members of the RSF were issued identity cards of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), which ensured them immunity,Human Rights Watch reported in 2015.
The RSF was commanded on the ground by Brig Gen Mohamed Hamdan ‘Hemeti’, former commander of the in Darfur notorious Border Guards militia, and Janjaweed leader.
The majority of the RSF troops consist of Darfuri Arab gunmen and militiamen, recruited by Hemeti since 2013. Ethnic Nuba have also reportedly been enlisted into the RSF. Sudanese who heard members of the RSF speaking, claimed that some of the fighters speak foreign dialects of Arabic, which they believe to be Chadian and Nigerian. In 2014-15 the RSF consisted of at least five to six thousand troops.
The RSF was integrated into the Sudanese army in 2017. The group used to be officially responsible for the persecution of illegal migrants and human smugglers.
Funding
According toSudan watchers, the RSF have allegedly been receiving funds, though indirectly, from the EU.
In the combat against human trafficking and illegal migration to Europe, the European Commission granted a development aid package of €155 million to the Sudanese government in 2016 “to tackle the root causes of irregular migration in the country and improve migration management processes”.
The USA-basedEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU’s financial support to Sudan in combating illegal migration would assist the notorious RSF militia – whichthe EU denied.
In September 2018, Hemetihit-out at the EUin for not thanking his forces for stopping illegal migrants at the border with Libya. The EU denied the allegations again.
Sudan also enjoys funding from Saudi Arabia since it joined the Saudi campaign against Iran-allied Houthi movement in Yemen in 2015. Most of the Sudanese troops fighting in Yemenbelong to the RSF.

CAIRO –In April 2015, President Omar al-Bashir traveled to the heart of Sudan's conflict-ravaged Darfur region to congratulate one of his hand-picked commanders on a recent victory over rebels.
Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, had led the so-called Rapid Support Forces on a series of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur and other restive provinces. The paramilitary force grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, and rights groups say forces under his command used many of the militias' brutal tactics.
"I signed the list of promotions that I received from you without even looking at it," al-Bashir told a cheering crowd, addressing Dagalo, as he stood atop a Land Cruiser in the sweltering heat, according to a contemporary account of the rally.
Four years later, al-Bashir is imprisoned in the capital, Khartoum, and Hemedti, who comes from a camel-trading family in a remote province, is the second most powerful man in Sudan.
He is the deputy head of the military council that assumed power after removing al-Bashir from office in April, following four months of mass protests. At 44, he is also the youngest member of the council. He says he refused orders from al-Bashir to fire on the protesters, and he praised them as recently as last weekend, saying "we want the democracy they are talking about."
Many see him as an ally against the Islamic movement that orchestrated al-Bashir's 1989 coup and underpinned his regime. Hemedti has supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which also hope to sideline the Islamists.
But his meteoric rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native Darfur, where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that al-Bashir launched in 2003, and for which the president was indicted for war crimes and genocide by the International Criminal Court.
Hemedti, who declined AP requests for an interview, has not been implicated in the atrocities carried out in Darfur in 2003 and 2004, when the government-backed Janjaweed rampaged across the region, torching villages and killing and raping ethnic Africans. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of the conflict, before the violence gradually declined.
___
DARFUR ABUSES
In an interview with documentary filmmakers in 2008, Hemedti said al-Bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in Darfur, but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas.
Magdi el-Gizouli, a scholar at the Rift Valley Institute, a think tank focused on East Africa, links Hemedti's rise to the military's outsourcing of the conflict to local forces.
"In essence, he is the reason why the rebellion in Darfur was defeated, because he was capable of recruiting an efficient fighting force that knew the local terrain well, that knew the geography well, and that had an ax to grind against farming communities in Darfur," he said.
The RSF, formed in 2013 and eventually including up to 10,000 fighters, was in some ways an attempt to bring greater discipline to the Arab militias and more closely tie them to the armed forces. Under Hemedti's command, the RSF waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015.
A 2015 report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch found that the RSF "committed a wide range of horrific abuses," including forcibly displacing entire communities, destroying wells and plundering livestock. "Among the most egregious abuses against civilians were torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes," it said.
Witnesses to a 2015 attack by the RSF in Darfur's Jebel Marra region said troops carried out mass rape in and around the village of Golo, often gang-raping women and girls in front of local elders before killing the women and leaving their bodies in the streets, Human Rights Watch said.
"As head of the RSF, Hemedti bears responsibility for the attacks on civilians his forces have carried out, in which civilians have been killed and villages have been burned to the ground," Jehanne Henry, a Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said last week. "The fact that Hemedti is now deputy head of the (transitional military council) is not lost on Darfuris I speak to."
The International Criminal Court has not brought charges against Hemedti. But it said in a 2014 report that the RSF under his command was "similar in structure and modus operandi" to the Janjaweed, with a "similar pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians."
___
TURNING ON AL-BASHIR
Hemedti's forces appear to have acquitted themselves better during the protests against his longtime patron al-Bashir, which erupted in December over rising bread prices and rapidly escalated into a popular uprising. He says his forces, like the regular army, refused al-Bashir's orders to violently disperse a sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum established on April 6. The military removed al-Bashir from power five days later, ending a 30-year reign marked by repression and civil war.
The protesters have remained in the streets , demanding that the military rapidly hand power over to a civilian government. But while the protesters have forced several officers to resign from the council after complaining they were too close to the former regime, there have not been widespread calls for Hemedti to step down.
"Many people, including some of Sudan's finest democrats, consider him a counterweight to the Islamic movement," el-Gizouli said. "A lot of people in Khartoum would be ready to tolerate him for a while. I'm not sure what they can do once this ends."
In the weeks since al-Bashir's overthrow, Hemedti has met with Western ambassadors and other envoys in his office in the presidential residence. He has said he has no interest in seeking higher office and has called for a government of technocrats.
"We want a real democracy, fair and free elections," he said Saturday. "Whoever the Sudanese choose will rule."
But he has also warned the protesters against any further "chaos," hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. In Darfur, government forces violently dispersed a rally earlier this month outside a military facility, setting off clashes in which an 18-year-old protester was killed.
The protesters in Khartoum have meanwhile expressed mounting frustration with the military council, accusing it of dragging its feet in order to keep much of al-Bashir's regime intact. As tensions escalate, Hemedti's balancing act could prove more challenging.
"Hemedti has been thinking that he is one of the leaders of the change because he was neutral in the protests," said Shamayel el-Nour, an activist with the Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded the demonstrations. "The protesters recognize his refusal to use force against them, but in Darfur he is viewed as a war criminal."

According to Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (aka Hemeti), deputy chairman of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and chief of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, the people who shot protesters at the sit-in in front of the Sudanese army command in downtown Khartoum last week have been arrested.

Hemeti further stressed the TMC’s “determination to hold accountable all spoilers among the leaders of the former regime”.
He explained that the leading members of the ousted regime, headed by Omar Al Bashir are now either in prison or hiding. “We will not leave those who fled, inside or outside the country,” he said.
The militia chief expressed his appreciation for the Alliance for Freedom and Change (AFC), and its role in the change that took place in the country.
“These brothers are well organised and make use of a high level of technology that exceeds even the state. They were able to oust country leaders who, without the AFC, may have ruled for another thirty years,” he said.
Sudan’s main militia
TheRSF militia was created in 2013to fight rebel movements throughout Sudan.
In January 2015, aconstitutional amendmentgave the militia the status of 'regular force'. Members of the RSF were issued identity cards of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), which ensured them immunity,Human Rights Watch reported in 2015.

Title: Pregnant woman shot dead in Sudan military clash
The woman, identified as a street vendor named Mayada Joon, was killed by "stray bullets" in a clash between "elements of the army and out of control soldiers", the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said on Wednesday.
The deadly skirmish came on the second and final day of atwo-day general strikein protest against the country's military rulers.
Workers across the country were on Tuesday and Wednesday demonstrating against failed negotiations between civilian representatives and the governing transitional military council, which has so far refused to cede to protesters' demand for a civilian leader and majority in an agreed-upon joint civilian-military transitional council.
Called for last week by protest organisers theSudanese Professionals Association(SPA), the nationwide strike has seenplanes grounded, newspapers unpublished, and businesses and public institutions shuttered.

"I believe that all the people in Sudan, no matter their ideology, want a more tolerant community towards different religions, ethnicities, backgrounds, as well as a stronger economy, a more transparent government and peace within the borders"https://t.co/Gpni65FsCf
The military reportedly attempted to force the employees of Sudan's Central Bank to work on Tuesday, allegedly beating and detaining workers and confiscating cash boxes when employees refused to comply, although social media posts indicated that protesting workers were able to strike unimpeded the following day.
The SPA said on Wednesday that it had not yet received "any communications" from the military towards restarting negotiations.
Demand for 'justice'
The reason for the clash between military forces on Sudan's central Nile Street thoroughfare is yet uncertain.
In an official statement on Wednesday, the transitional military council claimed Joon had been shot in the head and killed immediately by a "drunk soldier" who had used his "personal weapon" after "fighting" between civilians and the military.
It added that a civilian and a soldier had also been injured in the incident and that the soldier responsible had been arrested, claiming that the shooting had been an "isolated" incident.
The SPA also confirmed that others had been injured, but did not number the casualties.
Others have blamed the killing on a skirmish between military and paramilitary forces.
"TheRapid Support Forces(RSF) and the military seem to have had some sort of argument, which led to a shoot-out between the two sides and in which a pregnant woman got shot," reportedAl Jazeeracorrespondent Hiba Morgan.
The RSF is an official paramilitary force and an offshoot of the infamous Janjaweed militias allegedly responsible for war crimes in the Darfur conflict.
It is commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, the current deputy leader of Sudan's transitional council, and has been accused of killing protesters, as well as of grave human rights abuses in the country's South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur conflict zones.
"We condemn such childish and irresponsible behaviour by the armed forces whose presence should secure the safety and security of the citizen," said the SPA in a statement on Wednesday.
"We demand that those responsible be brought to justice."Follow us on Twitter:@the_newarab

Title: Hemedti: the feared commander pulling the strings in Sudan | Sudan | The Guardian
With talks over the country’s future deadlocked, Bashir’s former righthand man in Darfur is seen increasingly as a key player
When armed men fired on protesters in the Sudanese capital Khartoum earlier this month,killing six and injuring dozens, witnesses were quick to blame the Rapid Support Forces, a feared paramilitary outfit.
The forces are commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who also serves as deputy head of the Transitional Military Council, which has been running Sudan sinceOmar al-Bashir was oustedby the army after months of protests on 11 April.
Though witnesses saw troops in RSF-marked vehicles opening fire as they cleared barricades, Hemedti said those responsible for the violence had been found inside Khartoum University and the protesters’ encampment.
“These people have been arrested and confessed on camera,” he said, without offering further details or proof.
Bashir’s 30-year rule had been marked by civil war and widespread human rights abuses. The generals who seized power have resisted calls from the demonstrators and the international community to step down, insisting a new governing body be led by an officer.
As talks over the governing body remain deadlocked, Hemedti has increasingly been seen as a key player. His influence was underlined on Friday when it emerged he had met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has emerged as akey supporter of the new rulers of Sudansince Bashir’s fall.
The RSF has been repeatedly deployed in recent years to crack down on pro-democracy and other protesters. Around 10,000 RSF paramilitaries are deployed or close to Khartoum, observers say.
Hemedti haswarned protestersagainst any further “chaos”, hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. But he has also repeatedly said he would like to see democracy in Sudan and he refused orders from Bashir to violently disperse the sit-in outside the military headquarters in the capital that precipitated the dictator’s fall.
Last week, he told Egypt’s state newspaper al-Ahram that the ruling military council “wants to hand over power today not tomorrow”.
Western envoys and opposition activists in Khartoum say Hemedti, who comes from a family of camel traders in a remote province and dropped out of primary school, hopes to become president. “Hemedti planned on becoming the number one man inSudan. He has unlimited ambition,” said an opposition figure who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.
Analysts say Hemedti is backed by an informal coalition of diverse supporters. Some see him as an ally against the Islamist movement that orchestrated the 1989 coup, which brought Bashir to power and underpinned his regime.
Hemedti also supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, all of whomhope to sidelinethe Islamists.
His rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native Darfur, where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that Bashir launched in 2003, and for which the former president wasindicted for war crimes and genocideby the international criminal court.
About 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of that conflict, when the government-backed Janjaweed militia torched villages and killed and raped ethnic Africans across the Darfur region.
In an interview withdocumentary filmmakersin 2008, Hemedti said Bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in Darfur but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas.

Sudan’s pro-government militia were eventually reorganised into the RSF in 2013 in an attempt to impose greater discipline and more closely tie them to the armed forces. Under Hemedti’s command, the RSF waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015.

The RSF, formed in 2013 and eventually including up to 10,000 fighters, was in some ways an attempt to bring greater discipline to the Arab militias and more closely tie them to the armed forces. Under Hemedti's command, the RSF waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015.
A 2015 report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch found that the RSF "committed a wide range of horrific abuses," including forcibly displacing entire communities, destroying wells and plundering livestock. "Among the most egregious abuses against civilians were torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes," it said.
Witnesses to a 2015 attack by the RSF in Darfur's Jebel Marra region said troops carried out mass rape in and around the village of Golo, often gang-raping women and girls in front of local elders before killing the women and leaving their bodies in the streets, Human Rights Watch said.
"As head of the RSF, Hemedti bears responsibility for the attacks on civilians his forces have carried out, in which civilians have been killed and villages have been burned to the ground," Jehanne Henry, a Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said last week. "The fact that Hemedti is now deputy head of the (transitional military council) is not lost on Darfuris I speak to."
The International Criminal Court has not brought charges against Hemedti. But it said in a 2014 report that the RSF under his command was "similar in structure and modus operandi" to the Janjaweed, with a "similar pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians."

TURNING ON AL-BASHIR
Hemedti's forces appear to have acquitted themselves better during the protests against his longtime patron al-Bashir, which erupted in December over rising bread prices and rapidly escalated into a popular uprising. He says his forces, like the regular army, refused al-Bashir's orders to violently disperse a sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum established on April 6. The military removed al-Bashir from power five days later, ending a 30-year reign marked by repression and civil war.
The protesters have remained in the streets , demanding that the military rapidly hand power over to a civilian government. But while the protesters have forced several officers to resign from the council after complaining they were too close to the former regime, there have not been widespread calls for Hemedti to step down.
"Many people, including some of Sudan's finest democrats, consider him a counterweight to the Islamic movement," el-Gizouli said. "A lot of people in Khartoum would be ready to tolerate him for a while. I'm not sure what they can do once this ends."
In the weeks since al-Bashir's overthrow, Hemedti has met with Western ambassadors and other envoys in his office in the presidential residence. He has said he has no interest in seeking higher office and has called for a government of technocrats.
"We want a real democracy, fair and free elections," he said Saturday. "Whoever the Sudanese choose will rule."
But he has also warned the protesters against any further "chaos," hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. In Darfur, government forces violently dispersed a rally earlier this month outside a military facility, setting off clashes in which an 18-year-old protester was killed.
The protesters in Khartoum have meanwhile expressed mounting frustration with the military council, accusing it of dragging its feet in order to keep much of al-Bashir's regime intact. As tensions escalate, Hemedti's balancing act could prove more challenging.
"Hemedti has been thinking that he is one of the leaders of the change because he was neutral in the protests," said Shamayel el-Nour, an activist with the Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded the demonstrations. "The protesters recognize his refusal to use force against them, but in Darfur he is viewed as a war criminal."

CAIRO (AP) — In April 2015, President Omar al-Bashir traveled to the heart of Sudan's conflict-ravaged Darfur region to congratulate one of his hand-picked commanders on a recent victory over rebels.
Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, had led the so-called Rapid Support Forces on a series of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur and other restive provinces. The paramilitary force grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, and rights groups say forces under his command used many of the militias' brutal tactics.
"I signed the list of promotions that I received from you without even looking at it," al-Bashir told a cheering crowd, addressing Dagalo, as he stood atop a Land Cruiser in the sweltering heat, according to a contemporary account of the rally.
Four years later, al-Bashir is imprisoned in the capital, Khartoum, and Hemedti, who comes from a camel-trading family in a remote province, is the second most powerful man in Sudan.
He is the deputy head of the military council that assumed power after removing al-Bashir from office in April, following four months of mass protests. At 44, he is also the youngest member of the council. He says he refused orders from al-Bashir to fire on the protesters, and he praised them as recently as last weekend, saying "we want the democracy they are talking about."
Many see him as an ally against the Islamic movement that orchestrated al-Bashir's 1989 coup and underpinned his regime. Hemedti has supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which also hope to sideline the Islamists.
But his meteoric rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native Darfur, where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that al-Bashir launched in 2003, and for which the president was indicted for war crimes and genocide by the International Criminal Court.
Hemedti, who declined AP requests for an interview, has not been implicated in the atrocities carried out in Darfur in 2003 and 2004, when the government-backed Janjaweed rampaged across the region, torching villages and killing and raping ethnic Africans. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of the conflict, before the violence gradually declined.

DARFUR ABUSES
In an interview with documentary filmmakers in 2008, Hemedti said al-Bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in Darfur, but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas.
Magdi el-Gizouli, a scholar at the Rift Valley Institute, a think tank focused on East Africa, links Hemedti's rise to the military's outsourcing of the conflict to local forces.
"In essence, he is the reason why the rebellion in Darfur was defeated, because he was capable of recruiting an efficient fighting force that knew the local terrain well, that knew the geography well, and that had an ax to grind against farming communities in Darfur," he said.

Hemedti has supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which also hope to sideline the Islamists.
But his meteoric rise is closely linked to the ongoing conflict in his native Darfur, where his forces are accused of continuing the scorched-earth campaign against rebels that al-Bashir launched in 2003, and for which the president was indicted for war crimes and genocide by the International Criminal Court.
Hemedti, who declined AP requests for an interview, has not been implicated in the atrocities carried out in Darfur in 2003 and 2004, when the government-backed Janjaweed rampaged across the region, torching villages and killing and raping ethnic Africans. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced in the early years of the conflict, before the violence gradually declined.

DARFUR ABUSES
In an interview with documentary filmmakers in 2008, Hemedti said al-Bashir had personally asked him to lead the campaign against the insurgency in Darfur, but he denied any involvement in attacks on civilians and said he had refused orders to attack civilian areas.
Magdi el-Gizouli, a scholar at the Rift Valley Institute, a think-tank focused on East Africa, links Hemedti’s rise to the military’s outsourcing of the conflict to local forces.
“In essence, he is the reason why the rebellion in Darfur was defeated, because he was capable of recruiting an efficient fighting force that knew the local terrain well, that knew the geography well, and that had an axe to grind against farming communities in Darfur,” he said.
The RSF, formed in 2013 and eventually including up to 10,000 fighters, was in some ways an attempt to bring greater discipline to the Arab militias and more closely tie them to the armed forces. Under Hemedti’s command, the RSF waged two major counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur, in 2014 and 2015.
A 2015 report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch found that the RSF “committed a wide range of horrific abuses,” including forcibly displacing entire communities, destroying wells and plundering livestock. “Among the most egregious abuses against civilians were torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes,” it said.
Witnesses to a 2015 attack by the RSF in Darfur’s Jebel Marra region said troops carried out mass rape in and around the village of Golo, often gang-raping women and girls in front of local elders before killing the women and leaving their bodies in the streets, Human Rights Watch said.
“As head of the RSF, Hemedti bears responsibility for the attacks on civilians his forces have carried out, in which civilians have been killed and villages have been burned to the ground,” Jehanne Henry, a Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said last week. “The fact that Hemedti is now deputy head of the (transitional military council) is not lost on Darfuris I speak to.”
The International Criminal Court has not brought charges against Hemedti. But it said in a 2014 report that the RSF under his command was “similar in structure and modus operandi” to the Janjaweed, with a “similar pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians.”

TURNING ON AL-BASHIR
Hemedti’s forces appear to have acquitted themselves better during the protests against his longtime patron al-Bashir, which erupted in December over rising bread prices and rapidly escalated into a popular uprising. He says his forces, like the regular army, refused al-Bashir’s orders to violently disperse a sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum established on April 6. The military removed al-Bashir from power five days later, ending a 30-year reign marked by repression and civil war.
The protesters have remained in the streets , demanding that the military rapidly hand power over to a civilian government. But while the protesters have forced several officers to resign from the council after complaining they were too close to the former regime, there have not been widespread calls for Hemedti to step down.
“Many people, including some of Sudan’s finest democrats, consider him a counterweight to the Islamic movement,” el-Gizouli said. “A lot of people in Khartoum would be ready to tolerate him for a while. I’m not sure what they can do once this ends.”
In the weeks since al-Bashir’s overthrow, Hemedti has met with Western ambassadors and other envoys in his office in the presidential residence. He has said he has no interest in seeking higher office and has called for a government of technocrats.
“We want a real democracy, fair and free elections,” he said Saturday. “Whoever the Sudanese choose will rule.”
But he has also warned the protesters against any further “chaos,” hinting late last month that the military may use force if the unrest continues. In Darfur, government forces violently dispersed a rally earlier this month outside a military facility, setting off clashes in which an 18-year-old protester was killed.
The protesters in Khartoum have meanwhile expressed mounting frustration with the military council, accusing it of dragging its feet in order to keep much of al-Bashir’s regime intact. As tensions escalate, Hemedti’s balancing act could prove more challenging.
“Hemedti has been thinking that he is one of the leaders of the change because he was neutral in the protests,” said Shamayel el-Nour, an activist with the Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded the demonstrations. “The protesters recognize his refusal to use force against them, but in Darfur he is viewed as a war criminal.”

Title: Guns, explosives seized in Sudan raid
KHARTOUM: Sudan’s controversial paramilitary force said its troops on Monday seized several guns, explosives and ammunition during a raid in Khartoum, not far from where thousands of demonstrators are holding a sit-in.The Rapid Support Force, Sudan’s counter-insurgency unit, said the raid on a house in the capital’s eastern district of Al-Taif followed reports of "strange activity" there. The RSF had "thwarted an attempt to sabotage the security and stability of the country, and seized large quantities of weapons, ammunition and explosives", it said, adding that several arrests were made.It did not specify the quantity or type of guns and explosives seized. The raid comes as thousands of protesters remain camped outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, about seven kilometres away.The RSF, formerly made up of militiamen accused by rights groups of abuses in the conflict-wracked Darfur region, now forms part of the Sudanese armed forces. It was formed in 2013 under the rule of ousted president Omar al-Bashir to fight rebels in Darfur.

Title: Sudanese general's path to power ran through Darfur | Daily Mail Online
ByAssociated Press

CAIRO (AP) - In April 2015, President Omar al-Bashir traveled to the heart of Sudan's conflict-ravaged Darfur region to congratulate one of his hand-picked commanders on a recent victory over rebels.
Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, had led the so-called Rapid Support Forces on a series of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur and other restive provinces. The paramilitary force grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias, and rights groups say forces under his command used many of the militias' brutal tactics.
"I signed the list of promotions that I received from you without even looking at it," al-Bashir told a cheering crowd, addressing Dagalo, as he stood atop a Land Cruiser in the sweltering heat, according to a contemporary account of the rally.
Four years later, al-Bashir is imprisoned in the capital, Khartoum, and Hemedti, who comes from a camel-trading family in a remote province, is the second most powerful man in Sudan.
He is the deputy head of the military council that assumed power after removing al-Bashir from office in April, following four months of mass protests. At 44, he is also the youngest member of the council. He says he refused orders from al-Bashir to fire on the protesters, and he praised them as recently as last weekend, saying "we want the democracy they are talking about."
Many see him as an ally against the Islamic movement that orchestrated al-Bashir's 1989 coup and underpinned his regime. Hemedti has supplied ground forces to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen and can count on the support of the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which also hope to sideline the Islamists.
