Sudan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok speaks during joint press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Khartoum  on 5 Sept 2019 (Reuters Photo)September 15, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok on Sunday sacked the head of the Sudanese Radio and Television Corporation (SRTC) Ismail Isawi.
The decision intervenes amid growing calls to purge senior officials appointed by the former regime or the Transitional Military Council, such as the case of Isawi.
In his decision, Hamdok appointed his deputy Ibrahim al-Buzai to replace him.
Issawi was appointed to this post a few months ago by the head of the military council Abdel Fattah al Burhan, who sacked the then director Jamal al-Din Mustafa shortly after his appointment because of his support to the Freedom and Change Forces who a the time had been at odds with the military body.
The sacked head of the SRTC, for his part, showed full support to the Rapid Support Forces during the raid on the site-in camp last June and the days after which witnessed brutal crackdown on the protesters.
At the time, the official TV aired two programs showing the site of the pro-democracy protest and described it as a site for drug and alcohol trade and prostitution.
Recently, the State TV supprised the Sudanese with its absence from the first press conference of the prime minister.
In remarks after the formation of his cabinet, Hamdok said he was convinced that not all Sudanese are satisfied with the performance of the official Sudan Television.
In response to the persisting calls to sack Isawi,  the Sudanese Information Minister Faisal Mohamed Saleh stressed that he does not have the authority to dismiss him and that only the prime minister can do that.

Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces began shaving the heads of men with “deviant haircuts” in northern Khartoum last week.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, began shaving the heads of men with “devianthairstyles”in northern Khartoum last week.
Speaking to Radio Dabanga, listeners reported from Khartoum North’s East Nile locality that the head-shaving campaign began on Tuesday.
The paramilitaries are shaving men by force in the districts of El Haj Yousef, El Tawidat, El Karton, and El Radmiyat, as part of “the fight against negative phenomena”.
They are targeting youths, “especially those with haircuts like famous soccer players”.
Activists condemned the campaign on social media. Some call it “a terrorist attack”, others “a violation of human dignity” pointing to “human rights guaranteed by international charters”.
In August, this station reported about RSF militiamen detaining secondary school students and shaving their heads inNorth Darfur’s Mellit.
Last year in October, RSF membersshaved a girl’s headwhen they discovered she belonged to the Mahameed, a northern Darfuri clan headed by notorious janjaweed leader Musa Hilal.
In December, dozens of youths and students in Sudan’s Northern State were convicted to beshavedin publicfor their alleged odd haircuts and wearing of inappropriate dress.

Title: Militia leader: ‘Sudan no longer combats human trafficking’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The commander of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), announced that his government has stopped dealing with illegal immigration and combating human trafficking and smuggling “because the Western countries have not responded to Khartoum’s efforts in this regard”.
The commander of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), announced that his government has stopped dealing with illegal immigration and combating human trafficking and smuggling “because the Western countries have not responded to Khartoum’s efforts in this regard”.
He said in an interview with Sudan National Television: “There is no international response, so we have stopped fighting human trafficking and illegal immigration”.
He pointed out that Sudan is a major crossing point, dealing with 65 per cent of illegal immigration to Europe.
Workshop
However, Sudan’s Second Vice-President Hasabo Abdelrahman confirmed in a workshop held in Khartoum on Tuesday under the titleHuman Trafficking, Contemporary Slavery in a Profitable Trade, his government’s commitment to combating the phenomenon representing a contemporary form of slavery and announced that his government has been reviewing the national legislation in line with international law.
Professor of Political Science at the Centre for International Relations, Dr El Rashid Ibrahim, said Hamdan’s speech came within the framework of the government’s tactics to urge the Western countries to support them in the issue of illegal immigration, which considered international and a constant source of concern and headache for the European countries bordering the Mediterranean, this as well as the unrest of Khartoum regime with regard to what it finds of the dealings of Western countries that continue to list it on black lists or impose an economic isolation on it.
RSF Commander Hemeti  has hit-out at the EU before for not thanking his forces for stopping migrants
Sudan and the EU cooperatein the combat against human trafficking and illegal migration, with the help of funding by the European Commission to the Sudanese government that started in 2016. It has been implemented under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. At the time it contained the development aid package of €155 million to tackle the root causes of irregular migration in the country and improve migration management processes. This funding package, EU officials maintained, is strictly supporting humanitarian efforts, but Sudan watchers questioned how these funds can truly be tracked in a corrupt state.
The EU claimed it does not support Sudan's main paramilitary force (RSF) through its cooperation with the Sudanese government, in reaction to RSF commander Hemeti whohit-out at the EUfor not thanking his forces for stopping illegal migrants at the border with Libya. In April this year, however, theNew York Times onlinepointed to the EU “quietly getting its hands dirty” by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records.
Also international organisations have shown doubts whether the funding for Sudan’s border migration management to combat illegal migration will be channelled through non-Sudanese groups. The USA-based activist organisationEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU’s financial support to Sudan in mitigating and combating illegal migration would assist the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces – which the EU denied.
Detention
On Wednesday, members of the RSF held two men from inside the Kagero market in Fanga in North Darfur’s Tawila locality on charges of supporting the armed movements.
Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that RSF militiamen riding four vehicles stormed the market and detained Yahya Haroun and Adam Shogar and took them to their headquarters in the area.
The witnesses expressed their concern that they might be subjected to torture or ill-treatment by members of the RSF.
They appealed to human rights and humanitarian organisations to intervene to save their lives.

Title: Sudan militia prevents smuggling of 154 men to Libya - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, have thwarted the smuggling of 154 young men from North Darfur to Libya last week.
Col. Osman Abulgasem, Director of the RSF Guidance and Services Department, told the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) on Saturday that the men were captured in El Malha, from where they would be smuggled into Libya.
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia, have thwarted the smuggling of 154 young men from North Darfur to Libya last week.
Col. Osman Abulgasem, Director of the RSF Guidance and Services Department,told the official Sudan News Agency(SUNA) on Saturday that the men were captured in El Malha, from where they would be smuggled into Libya.
Most of the captured illegal migrants are aged between 22 and 26 years. Most of them are Sudanese, others are Arab nationals.
Preliminary investigations indicate that the men are members of “terrorist organisations and negative movements”, he said.
The group has been transferred to El Jeili military camp near Khartoum.
Abulgasem added that the RSF halted eight large human trafficking operations in the triangle border between Sudan, Libya, and Egypt.
He emphasised that the RSF “remain vigilant to the borders of the country [..] to combat negative phenomena, the smuggling of arms, drugs, and human trafficking”. The government militia abides by “the international conventions and human values that care for the rights of the victims” and has treated the captives “humanely”.
Support
Last week, the commander-general of the RSF, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), announced that his government stopped combating human trafficking and illegal immigration “because the Western countries have not responded to Khartoum’s efforts in this regard”.
Sudan’s Second Vice-President Hasabo Abdelrahman denied Hamdan’s statements the following day. Khartoum remains committed to combating the phenomenon of human trafficking that represents “a contemporary form of slavery”, he said at a workshop. He added that his government has reviewed the national legislation to be in line with international law.
Sudan is a main source and transit country for many refugees attempting to travel to Europe. The EU therefore opted to financially support the Sudanese government in the combat against human trafficking and illegal migration.In April 2016, the EU established the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The Fund contained a development aid package of €100 million that should tackle the root causes of instability, irregular migration and displacement in eastern Sudan, Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. Another €40 million was allocated to Better Migration Management in Khartoum. An additional amount of €15 million should improve the living conditions of refugees and host communities in eastern Sudan (Kassala) and Khartoum and strengthen the capacity of local authorities.
Sudanese and international activists have questioned the funding. The USA-based watchdogEnough Project warned in April 2017that EU support to Sudan in combating illegal migration would assist “the notorious RSF” – whichthe EU denied.
TheNew York Timespointed to the EU “quietly getting its hands dirty” by outsourcing border management to countries with dubious human rights records. Radio Dabanga reported that the commander-general of the RSF wantedthe international community to recognisethe efforts of his troops to halt human trafficking.
In April this year, the EU and Sudan launched a joint initiative to combat human trafficking and illegal migration in the region. The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa is funding the three-year-initiative. It will be implemented by the the International Organization for Migration (IOM), with a budget of €45 million for theentire Horn of Africa(Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia).
‘US Terrorism list’
In October last year, Washingtonlifted two-decades-old economic sanctionson Khartoum “in recognition of the Government of Sudan's sustained positive actions to maintain a cessation of hostilities in conflict areas in Sudan, improve humanitarian access throughout Sudan, and maintain cooperation with the US on addressing regional conflicts and the threat of terrorism”.
The US decision did not include the removal of Sudan from the list of statessponsoring terrorism– to which it was added in 1993.
In September last year, the USA added Sudan to the list of countries accused offailing to combat human trafficking. This has led to legal restrictions on Sudan for the 2018 fiscal year, and could further isolate Khartoum from Washington.
In an op-ed publshed in February this year, Enough Project's John Prendergast wrote that theUS move towards normalising relationswith Sudan is ignoring critical developments that affect core American security interests.

Title: Rape case file disappears at South Sudanese presidency blocking appeal: rights groups - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
South Sudanese presidential palace in Juba (Pinterest photo)September 6, 2019 (JUBA) – Two international human rights groups unveiled that a case file of sexual assaults foreign aid workers and murder of a journalist by South Sudanese soldiers is missing since it was sent to President Salva Kiir in 2018.
On 6 September 2018, a South Sudanese court sentenced 10 soldiers to prison from seven years to life imprisonment for the rape of foreign aid workers and the murder of a journalist in the Terrain hotel in Juba on July 11, 2016. Also the military judges ordered the government to pay a compensation of $4,000 to each victim.
But, the case file has not been seen since it was sent to President Salva Kiir in 2018 for confirmation before the judgment was delivered, said a joint statement released by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on Friday 6 September.
As a result, one year after the rule, “the Supreme Court is unable to move forward with appeals by the victims and those convicted because of the missing file,” said the joint statement.
“UN officials and diplomats strongly suspect the file was lost in the Office of the President,” said the joint statement.
The sexual assault survivors said that the compensation was not commensurate with the crimes and wanted to appeal the verdict. also the convicted soldiers filed their intention to appeal the sentences.
“The authorities should ensure that there are no deliberate attempts to obstruct justice and locate the file, so the Supreme Court can examine the appeal,” said Antonia Mulvey, founder and executive director of Legal Action Worldwide.
For its part, Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch said: “The disappearance of the case file has effectively stalled the appeal process and serves as a classic example of the justice system failures that exacerbate the culture of impunity in South Sudan.”

Title: North Darfur sets ultimatum for registration of unlicensed cars - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The North Darfur authorities have given owners of unlicensed vehicles in the state a week to register their cars.
The North Darfur authorities have given owners of unlicensed vehicles in the state a week to register their cars.
The North Darfur High Commission for the Collection of Unlicensed Firearms and Vehicles announced last weekend that the last possibility to register unlicensed vehicles at the customs administration offices in the state capital of El Fasher or in Zamzam, Zurog, and El Malha would be between September 11 and 19.
The alternative will be confiscation by members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia.
The owners of the vehicles have to bring documents that prove their ownership of the cars. In the event they do not show up during the specified week period, they will lose their right to register.
The Commission began its work in early July. Eyewitnesses told Radio Dabanga at the time that about 12,000 vehicles were being held by the RSF in the area of Zurog.
Independent federal MP Siham Hasan told Radio Dabanga that she considers a deadline of one week far from enough. “Most of the car owners are now tending their farms. Moreover, it is not very safe on the roads, as armed robberies are rife in the area.”
The MP expressed surprise about the lack of cooperation between the governments of the five states of Darfur. “This decision was taken by the North Darfur authorities only,” she said. She also wondered why militiamen of the RSF militiamen are ordered to execute the confiscations, instead of regular customs employees.
She called on the North Darfur authorities “to consider the safety and rights of car owners” and warned of serious consequences in the case of confiscation of the vehicles.
Disarmament
For years, the authorities in Darfur are trying to curb the rampant insecurity in the region.Unregistered vehicles(imported or militia-owned), the wearing of a turban covering the face (kadamool) and the carrying of weapons by civilianshave all been banned.
In August last year, army forces and the Rapid Support Forces, Sudan’s main militia, began implementing a major disarmament campaign in Darfur. In end December however, theGovernor of NorthDarfur acknowledgedthat the arms collection did not lead to the planned results that far. He pointed to the large spread of weapons in the state, and stressed that there was “still a long way to go”.
Many people in Darfur, at a distance of more than 800 kilometres from Khartoum, buy cars smuggled from Chad, Niger and a number of west African countries. Theseso-called Boko Haram carsare usually not registered by the new owners. Other unlicensed vehicles are cars used by (former) militiamen for private purposes.

Title: Two days left to register unlicensed vehicles in North Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Independent news from the heart of Sudan

Wednesday is the last day before the deadline to register unlicensed vehicles in North Darfur, in terms of an ultimatum issued by the North Darfur High Commission for the Collection of Unlicensed Firearms and Vehicles.
Wednesday is the last day before the deadline to register unlicensed vehicles in North Darfur, in terms of an ultimatum issued by the North Darfur High Commission for the Collection of Unlicensed Firearms and Vehicles.
Thedeadline announced by the High Commission earlier this monthindicates that the last possibility to register unlicensed vehicles at the customs administration offices in the state capital of El Fasher or in Zamzam, Zurog, and El Malha would be between September 11 and 19.
The alternative will be confiscation by members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia.
The owners of the vehicles have to bring documents that prove their ownership of the cars. In the event they do not show up during the specified one-week period, they will lose their right to register.
Response
The head of the High Commission, Maj. Gen. Eisa Adam, announced the registration and licensing of 1,870 vehicles in the presence of their owners at Zurog area in North Darfur have been completed in preparation for the completion of customs procedures in accordance with the Customs Act.
While he did not quote numbers, Gen. Adam said that other vehicles are still unregistered due to incomplete papers or the absence of owners.
In early July, witnesses told Radio Dabanga that about 12,000 vehicles were being held by the RSF in the area of Zurog.
Independent MP Siham Hasan told Radio Dabanga that she considers the latest deadline far from enough. “Most of the car owners are now tending their farms. Moreover, it is not very safe on the roads, as armed robberies are rife in the area.”
Gen. Adam stressed that Wednesday September 19  day of this month is the last day for inventory and registration of these vehicles.
He said that the committee visited the localities of Mellit and El Malha, and also Zamzam camp, during which it stood on the preparation of unlicensed vehicles, which had earlier been seized by the RSF in those areas. He said that the committee also stood on El Malha locality’s arrangements for the establishment of a customs station.

Title: SPLA-IO denies recruiting fighters from Uganda - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
September 4, 2019 (JUBA) – South Sudan’s armed opposition movement (SPLM-IO) has dismissed recent reports alleging they were luring youth in northern Uganda with cash promises to join the group.
Lam Paul Gabriel“The Resident District Commissioner of Lamwo James Kidega has once again attacked the SPLA-IO through The Observer online media outlet on Sept. 1. He alleged that SPLA-IO is recruiting Ugandan youth into its ranks and files with promise of decent remuneration. This is a white lie aimed at tarnishing the image of the SPLA-IO,” said Gabriel in a statement issued in Juba,” clarified Lam Paul Gabriel, the deputy military spokesman of the rebel movement.
The official said the armed opposition group does not recruit or operate abroad.
Earlier media reports claimed the SPLA-IO is integrating Ugandan officers in its ranks and have recruited 30 youth from Gulu, a district near the Lamwo-South Sudan border in Eastern Equatoria region.
Lam, in a statement, said SPLA-IO is already participating in implementing the transitional security arrangements with the Juba government and all its forces are in cantonment sites awaiting registration and screening.
Last week, the International Refugee Rights Initiative (IRRI), a report, said while some members of the warring parties visited refugee settlements to reunite with their families, others tended to target their political opponents.
The research, the organisation said, was conducted between 2018 and May 2019.
Speaking during the launch of the report in Kampala last week, IRRI’s executive director, Achieng Akena, said parties involved in the South Sudanese conflict should be held accountable for their actions.
The report, among others, recommended thorough investigations into recruitment and abuses against refugees by the warring factions to ensure that individuals involved are arrested and prosecuted.
It further recommended that the Ugandan government increases police presence in refugee settlements, support training on refugee and host community relations, and strengthen community policing.
There are an estimated 800,000 South Sudanese refugees in Ugandan camps.
South Sudan descended into civil war in mid-December 2013 and the ongoing conflict has created one of the fastest-growing refugee crises in the world.
In September 2018, South Sudan’s conflicting parties signed a final peace deal in Addis Ababa after negotiations brokered by the Sudanese government and mandated by regional nations.

Over a century after the original Scramble for Africa, European leaders are today imposing new forms of colonialism on the continent in the shape of militarized border controls.

Illustrations byZoran Svilar
Read this article in Spanishhere
In 1891, the French economist Paul Leroy Beaulieu fiercely defended European colonialism in Africa, saying: “This state of the world implies for the civilized people a right of intervention … in the affairs of [barbarian tribes or savages].”
Beaulieu’s defense came in the midst of the European carve-up of Africa cemented in the 1885 Berlin agreement. As it has now been five decades since most African liberation movements won independence, it might therefore seem a surprise to read a European ambassador in May 2018declaringthat “Niger is now the southern border of Europe.”  Two thousand miles to the east, the ambassador’s comments were echoed by a Sudanese border patrol agent, Lieutenant Salih Omar, interviewed by theNew York Times, whoreferredto the Sudan-Eritrean border as “Europe’s southern border.”
There has long been an argument, prominently articulated by Ghanaian freedom-fighter Kwame Nkrumah, that European control of Africa’s destiny never ended with colonialism. These cogent arguments largely focused on the way debt, trade and aid have been used to structure the continued dependence of Africa’s newly independent states on Europe. The consensus, however, by both a European ambassador and a Sudanese border patrol guard that Europe’s border is not in the Mediterranean but lies as far away as Sudan and Niger, suggests that European territorial control of Africa has not really ended either.
The reason for this European re-engagement with African territory — and not just political and economic dominance — has been largely due to one factor: a desire to control migration. The rise in the number of refugees fleeing to Europe, particularly after the Syrian civil war, pushed migration high up the political agenda, releasing significant resources for border control. Europe’s Coastguard and Border Agency Frontex has seen an incredible 5,233 percent rise in funding since 2005 (from €6 million to €320 million in 2018). Borders have been militarized in Eastern Europe and border guards deployed across Europe from Calais to Lesvos.
Less well known is that it has also led the EU to put migration control at the heart of its international policies and its relations with third countries, insisting on border control agreements with more than 35 neighboring nations to control migration, labelled in Commission-speak as “border externalization”. These agreements require signatory nations to accept deported migrants from Europe, to increase border controls and staff on borders, introduce new biometric identity and passport systems to monitor migrants, as well as to build detention camps to detain refugees.
The rationale given by the EU is that this will prevent the deaths of refugees, but a more likely reason is that it wants to make sure that refugees are stopped long before they get to European shores. This satisfies both the hostile racist politicians in Europe as well as those seemingly more liberal politicians unwilling to confront whipped-up anti-immigrant sentiment, who want the crisis out of sight, out of mind. Germany, for example, with a relatively progressive record of welcoming refugees (at least in the summer of 2015), is also one of the main funders of border externalization, happily signing agreements with dictators like Sisi in Egypt to prevent refugees heading to Europe.
The evidence suggests these agreements may have served the EU’s ultimate purpose of decreasing numbers entering Europe, but it certainly has not increased refugees’ safety and security. Most studies show that it has forced refugees to seek more dangerous routes and rely on ever more unscrupulous traffickers. The proportion of recorded deaths to arrivals on Mediterranean routes to Europe in 2017 was overfive times as highin 2017 as it was in 2015. Many more deaths at sea and in deserts in North Africa are never recorded.
As anew reportby the Transnational Institute and Stop Wapenhandel reveals, it has also led the European Union to embrace authoritarian regimes — and worse, provide equipment and funding to repressive police and security forces — while diverting necessary resources from investments in health, education and jobs.
Niger, a major transit country for refugees, has become the biggest per capita recipient of EU aid in the world. This is partly because it is one of the world’s poorest countries, but it is also prioritized because it is a gateway for many refugees heading to Europe. There seem to be no limits to resources available for border infrastructure, yet the World Food Program, which supports almost a tenth of Niger’s population, has received only 34 per cent of the funding it needs for 2018. Meanwhile, under European pressure, the strengthening of border security has destroyed the migration-based economy in the Agadez region, threatening the fragile internal stability in the country.
The EU’s dependence on cooperation with the Nigerien government has also emboldened the country’s autocratic leaders. A protest against increased food prices by Nigeriens in March 2018, for example, led to the arrests of its main organizers. Refugees travelling through Niger report increased human rights abuses and are forced to take greater risks to migrate. In one horrifying case in June 2016, the bodies of 34 refugees, including 20 children, were found in the Sahara desert, apparently left to die from thirst by smugglers.
Similarly in Sudan, the European Union maintains that it upholds international sanctions on the notorious Al-Bashir regime for its war crimes and repression, yet it has not faltered in signing border control agreements with Sudanese government agencies. This has included training and equipment for border police officers, even though Sudan’s borders are patrolled primarily by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which consist of former Janjaweed militia fighters used to fight internal dissent under the operational command of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). Human Rights Watch has “found that the RSF committed a wide range of horrific abuses, including … torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes.” The German government agency GIZ says it is aware of the risks of cooperation, but nevertheless considers it “necessary” to include them in capacity development measures.
Europe’s involvement in Sudan and Niger underscores author and activist Harsha Walia’s argument in her book,Undoing Border Imperialism, that border control measures are a form of imperialism because they include displacement, criminalization, racialized hierarchies and the exploitation of people. It is noticeable in terms of historical echoes for EU border imperialism that while the Scramble for Africa was largely defended by its colonial apologists for its potential to civilize the “barbarians” at Europe’s gates, the focus this time seems to be only about keeping the “barbarians” from passing through Europe’s gates.
In even more disturbing historical parallels, it is shocking to note that while the 1885 Berlin Agreement stipulated that Africa “may not serve as a market or means of transit for the trade in slaves, of whatever race they may be,” the EU’s collaboration with Libyan militia has actually led to a revival of the slave trade, with refugees being sold as slaves captured on CNN in late 2017.
We should not ultimately be surprised. As journalist Dawn Paleyhas noted, “far from preventing violence, the border is in fact the reason it occurs.” Borders are walls that seek to block out a gross inequality between Africa and Europe constructed during colonialism and perpetuated by European economic and political policies today. Ultimately this violence is felt on the body, the border marking its scars across the flesh of people. It is felt in the torn skin of those who daily try to cross the fortified fences of Ceuta and Melilla in Morocco. It is felt in the violated bodies of women raped and abused by smugglers and border guards. It is there in the many undiscovered skeletons in North African deserts and the Mediterranean Sea.
This border imperialism is not an exclusive European phenomenon. It can be found in Mexico’sPrograma Frontera Sur,started in 2014 under pressure from the United States, to strengthen border security on its border with Guatemala. Like its European equivalents, it has also resulted in more repression and violence against refugees, increased detention and deportations and the forcing of refugees towards more dangerous migration routes and into the hands of criminal smuggle networks.
Perhaps the most well-known example of border externalization are Australia’s offshore detention centers on the islands of Nauru and, until ruled illegal last year, in Manus (Papua New Guinea). All migrants trying to go to Australia by sea are transported to these centers, which are run by private contractors, and kept there for long periods. If the detained refugees are granted asylum status, they are resettled in third countries. This policy is accompanied by “Operation Sovereign Borders”, a military maritime operation to force or tow refugee boats back to international waters.
There have been many cases of human rights violations in Australia’s offshore detention centers. Yet many European leaders have embraced the Australian model, increasingly arguing for the EU to put refugees in “processing camps” in North African countries, building on the current policy of turning Europe’s neighbors into its new border guards. Europe enthusiastically embraces the Australian approach of building camps in remote places, which, as human rights lawyer Daniel Webb notes, serve “to hide from view what they don’t want the public to see — deliberate cruelty to innocent human beings.”
While the similarities between these examples of border externalization are undeniable, only in Europe do they explicitly connect the policies to old colonial relations. At the launch of the Partnership Framework on Migration, the overall framework for cooperation on migration with third countries, in June 2016, the European Commission noted that “the special relationships that member states may have with third countries, reflecting political, historic and cultural ties fostered through decades of contacts, should also be exploited to the full for the benefit of the EU.” It also unequivocally praised the opportunity the agreement provided for European business, arguing that “private investors looking for new investment opportunities in emerging markets” must play a much greater role instead of “traditional development co-operation models.”
This points us towards the private interests benefiting from these border externalization policies: the military and security industries providing the equipment and services to implement strengthened and militarized border security and control in third countries. A plethora of firms have thrived in this expanding market, but prominent among them are European arms giants such as Airbus (Paneuropean), Thales (France) and Leonardo (Italy — formerly named Finmeccanica).
These are not just the casual winners of EU policies; they are also the driving forces behind them. They have both set the general discourse — framing migration as a security threat, to be combated by military means — as well as put forward concrete proposals, such as the creation of the EU surveillance “system of systems” EUROSUR and the expansion of Frontex, which through successful lobbying have been turned into official EU policies and new institutions.
These firms then can reap the rewards by promoting their own services and products, helped along by their constant interaction with EU policymakers. This encompasses regular meetings with officials at the European Commission and Frontex, participation in official advisory bodies, the issuing of influential advisory papers, participation in security fairs and conferences, and more. While the main focus has been on militarizing the EU external borders, companies increasingly eye the African border security market as well. Hence they are also lobbying for EU funding for border security purchases of third countries.
This strategy has paid off handsomely. Strengthening the global competitiveness of the European military and security industry has now become a stated objective of the EU. The Commission plans for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the EU budget for 2021-2027, propose to almost triple spending on migration control. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, EU member states and third countries will all get more money to spend on strengthening border security, including the purchase of military and security equipment and services.

While specific horrific situations, such as the migrant slave markets in Libya or a particular drowning incident in the Mediterranean, sometimes cause outrage and opposition, it is hard to see a change in the general European emphasis on “bringing down the numbers” of people willing to make the crossing. This is even more challenging when EU border militarization is outsourced to and hence rendered largely invisible in countries far from Europe.
EU policies need to be fought at a number of levels, both inside the EU and in third countries. This means that we do not only need to act against the most obvious manifestations of these policies — in terms of border control and the detention and deportations of refugees — but also against the private interests behind these policies. We have to unmask the commercial, industrial forces that are currently profiting from Europe’s border imperialism, as well as the media outlets and political parties that have manipulated public opinion by targeting refugees as scapegoats for the consequences of austerity policies.
More systemically, confronting border colonialism requires addressing Western responsibility at large, eliminating the reasons people are forced to flee in the first place, and resisting those policies and stakeholders in Western countries that are causing them: EU support for authoritarian rulers, the companies causing climate change, unjust trade relations, corporate impunity, reckless military interventions and the arms trade. And it means true decolonization, ending the continued European grip on its former colonies, and working towards a fundamental shift in the international order. This will become even more important in the context of worsening climate change, when migration, even if largely internal, will be a necessary form of adaptation.
It will also require increased solidarity and cooperation with movements and organizations in the third countries affected, in horizontal forms of collaboration. This could include support for migrant-led movements emerging in many countries, for communities that host large numbers of (stranded) refugees, direct humanitarian efforts such as the search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean, as well as for organizations advocating for human rights for migrants. But it could also include groups and movements fighting for democratization, against authoritarian regimes, against extractive industries, and those seeking a livelihood for everyone, against violence and Western domination.
Unravelling the legacy of colonialist violence will not be easy. While the European Union is divided on many issues, the consensus around border security is strong. The great decolonial thinker Frantz Fanon realized how colonialism colonized not just territory and the body but also the mind. As he wrote inBlack Skin, White Masks:
In order to terminate this neurotic situation, in which I am compelled to choose an unhealthy, conflictual solution, fed on fantasies, hostile, inhuman in short, I have only one solution: to rise above this absurd drama that others have staged around me, to reject the two terms that are equally unacceptable, and through one human being, to reach out for the universal.
It is a yearning for a universal humanity reflected in slogans that “no human is illegal” — the only true basis for an end to the violence of border imperialism.

Title: Maiwut state speaker welcomes defection of top rebel commander - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
September 26, 2019 (JUBA) – The speaker of South Sudan’s Maiwut state assembly has welcomed a top rebel commander’s decision to defect from the armed opposition faction (SPLM/A-IO), saying it would cease hostilities in an area which has been a hot spot of the conflict despite the permanent ceasefire between rival forces.
Major Gen. James Ochan Puot, one of the SPLM/A-IO’s top commanders, defected from the armed opposition group led by Riek Machar and joined President Salva Kiir.
Puot was the deputy commander of the SPLA-IO’s in charge of its 5th division.
In a statement issued on Thursday, lawmaker Choul D. Kir, who hails from the constituency of the defected armed opposition commander, also lauded government for welcoming Puot, saying it was time for peace, forgiveness and reconciliation.
“On behalf of Maiwut community in Government and on my own behalf with capacity as Speaker of the House, I would like to congratulate General James Ochan and Gajaak supported the Provisional Military and Political Council (PMPC) for the wise decision they have made. The declaration will cease hostility and bring lasting peace in Gajaak areas”, Kir said.
South Sudan’s Information minister, Michael Makuei said government welcomes the defected rebel official but did not mention the circumstances under which the armed opposition commander made the decision to abandon the SPLM/A-IO forces.
It remains unclear what would be done to troops that defected alongside Puot.
Puot, one of the SPLM/A-IO’s top commanders, announced on Sunday that he had defected from the armed opposition group led by Riek Machar and joined Kiir.
The defected general, who was the deputy commander of the SPLA-IO’s division 5, said he defected from the armed opposition group after “deliberate attacks, killings and displacement of Cie-waw community in Adar State where thousands of civilians were displaced from their homes by SPLA-IO forces since July 31, 2019.”
But the SPLM/A-IO, in a statement, said Puot’s decision to quit at a time of implementing the revitalized peace deal is a “counter-insurgency tactic of the security”.
South Sudan descended into war in December 2013 when Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup.
In September 2018, the rival factions involved in the conflict signed a peace deal to end the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 2 million people in the country.

Title: What is behind Sudan’s cabinet reshuffle? | Opinions | Al Jazeera
Amid deepening crisis, President Omar al-Bashir is trying to buy time ahead of the 2020 elections.
Late last week, the Sudanese regime was greatly embarrassed when Dr Abdalla Hamdok, Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa,declinedto accept the position of finance minister.
Hamdok, a renowned Sudanese economist with a leftist background, was named finance minister by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in the latest reshuffle of his government. His appointment was aimed at winning the good will of international financial institutions and the West and securing support for the ailing Sudanese economy.
After Hamdok’s refusal, the position was given temporarily to the new prime minister, Moataz Moussa, al-Bashir’s cousin. Two other people who were offered ministerial positions turned them down.
So far al-Bashir’s new cabinet, which is meant to take urgent measures to prop Sudan’s collapsing economy, has produced only confusion and criticism.
The changes it introduced, including the cutting of ministerial positions from 30 to 21, will not result in any meaningful reforms or usher in any lasting solution for Sudan’s political and economic crises.
The reshuffle is simply part of a strategy of political survival al-Bahir is pursuing which is unlikely to succeed.
One of the biggest problems with the new government is that it’s almost completely like the old one. The majority of the 21senior ministerswere members of the dissolved cabinet, including the new prime minister, Moussa, who previously served as minister of irrigation and electricity.
General Bakri Hassan Saleh, al-Bashir’s long-term confidante, who was prime minister and vice president in the previous government, remains in the position of first deputy to the president. The ministers of defence, foreign affairs and presidential affairs have also kept their posts.
Although the government has remained almost the same, there have been a few interesting changes. Hassabu Mohamed Abdel Rahman, who belongs to the Mahria clan of the Arab Rizeigat of Darfur and who was linked to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was removed from his position as second vice president.




He was replaced by Osman Yousef Kibir, former governor of the North Darfur state, who hails from the (non-Arab) Berti ethnic group and is regime loyalist.
The Darfur conflict pitted Arab tribes supported by the government against various ethnic African groups and the swap between Abdel Rahman and Kibir could mean that Bashir is seeking to build the image that the Darfur conflict has been resolved.
There was also an important change in the Khartoum state’s governorship. Gen Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein, Bashir’s long-term aide, was removed from the governor’s post and for the first time since 1989 will not be part of the government; he was replaced by Police Lt Col Hashimi Osman, also a regime loyalist.
The reshuffle in the government was also followed by a limited purge of the top ranks of the army. The Chief of Staff, Ali Mohamed Salim, his deputy and a number of other high-ranking officers were retired and replaced by people seen as loyal to al-Bashir.
Although the US sanctions on Sudan were lifted in October 2017, creating much expectation in the general population that the economy would improve, the situation in the country has continued to deteriorate. According to the government, the inflation rate reached 64 percent, while experts say that in reality it could be as high as 100 percent.
The prices of food, fuel and other basic commodities have more than doubled since last year, and the Sudanese pound has depreciated threefold against the US dollar during the same period. Unemployment is also increasing and currently is around 20 percent. Meanwhile, the government has done little to combat endemic corruption; Sudan is perceived as one of the most corrupt countries in the world,ranking 175th of the 180 countriesin the Transparency International’s 2017 report.
As a result, over the past five years, Sudan has witnessed regular waves of mass protests, which the government has violently cracked down on. In 2013, when thousands of people protested against fuel price hikes, the RSF and other militias responded with force, killing more than 200. Earlier this year, three people were killed duringpopular protestsagainst the rising price of bread.
Over the past year, al-Bashirfailed to securemuch needed financial support from the Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in return for Sudan’s ongoing participation in Yemen’s war, which has additionally exacerbated the situation.
His decision to reshuffle the government, however, is too little, too late and is unlikely to change much on the ground. Sudan needs major reforms and genuine political change in order to pull itself out of the current crisis.
Undoubtedly, al-Bashir recognises that the economic crises poses an existential threat to his regime. He fears that these mass protests could eventually develop into a full-fledged popular uprising that could remove him from power. But he is unable and unwilling to introduce major changes to the economic and political sphere
For that reason, al-Bashir is currently pursuing a strategy of buying time. The cabinet reshuffle, therefore, should be seen in that context: not as a genuine attempt to improve the situation but as a distraction from the ongoing crisis.
At the same time, the reshuffle – along with the purge in the army’s top ranks – is meant to consolidate the president’s power ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. The changes in government have effectively marginalised a group of Sudanese officials who oppose al-Bashir running for re-election and rewarded loyalists.
However, the cabinet reshuffle could also prove problematic in the long run. More specifically, the cutting of a number of ministerial positions will inevitably cause some disaffection within the political elite and may lead to some defections and disunity.
The removal of Hassabu Abdel Rahman from the post of vice president may trigger anger and tensions among some Arab groups in Darfur because they see having “one of their own” occupying the position of the second vice president as a reward for their loyalty to and defence of al-Bashir’s regime.
In the end, the strategy the Sudanese president has adopted is unlikely to succeed. The Sudanese people are yearning for real change and the current economy cannot sustain the status quo for long. Given how bad the situation is, a popular uprising is the best case scenario; the worst – implosion, disintegration and another conflict.
Al-Bashir should be wiser about his choices and what he does next. Pursuing a re-election in 2020 is definitely not the right strategy to ensure his political survival.

Title: Short-term Wins, Long-term Risks: Human Trafficking and People Smuggling in the Mediterranean Area - World | ReliefWeb
World+ 2 more
Tuesday ReitanoDeputy DirectorGlobal Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, Geneva
As has been the case over the past three years, 2018 has been characterized by the increasingly urgent efforts by European states to quell the flow of irregular migrants across the Mediterranean, put to sea in lethal ways by human smugglers in Libya. And 2018 is worthy of note, because it appears that those efforts are finally beginning to take hold: sea arrivals in Italy have dropped by almost 75%.
Since the Valletta Summit held at the end of 2015, the European Union (EU) as a bloc and more so through the direct initiatives of some if its Member States has expanded its efforts to address the ‘migrant crisis.’ The summit marked the launch of the EU’s Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, which included a range of incentives to African states to partner more forcibly in the quest for migration control. It included, for example, a significant package of support to Niger, whose northern border with Libya was seen as a key staging post for West Africans heading towards Libya’s coast. It also included investments in Sudan and Chad, which, despite their complex political and human rights records, were seen as crucial partners if flows of people from East Africa and the Horn were also to be reduced.Individual Member States are reducing their investments in downstream development programming in order to support enhanced border security objectives.
These efforts have borne the intended fruit, in terms of reducing migratory flows, though not without the ethics of the EU being called sharply into question. In Sudan, a part of the efforts to interdict migrants have been carried out by former Janjaweed fighters, resulting in NGOs reporting grave human rights abuses by those forces against migrants and in border communities. The Nigerien government, having agreed at the behest of the EU in 2015 to criminalize smuggling through a new law, has clamped down aggressively on the smuggling trade. Despite the strain that this places on the economy, sustainability and stability of the country’s fractious northern regions, the government took steps to close down the migration hub of Agadez, arresting (largely low-level) smugglers and agreeing to take and dispatch migrants returned from Libya.

Dans un communiqué de presse ce mercredi 05 septembre 2018, Reporters sans frontières (Rsf) demande à la haute autorité des médias et de audiovisuel (Hama), l’organe de régulation des médias tchadiens de revenir sur sa décision de suspendre pour trois mois l’hebdomadaireAl-Chahedpour “divulgation de fausses nouvelles”.
Le jeudi 30 août dernier, laHaute autorité des médias et de l’audiovisuel(Hama), après saisine du ministère des Affaires étrangères, suspend pour trois mois, le journal Al-Chahed pour “plagiat” et “divulgation de fausses nouvelles” suite à un article établissant un lien entre le Qatar, le Soudan et la rébellion au Nord du pays.
Dans une analyse intitulée : “Qui est derrière les forces rebelles tchadiennes dans le nord?”, le journal évoque les contradictions de la politique de coopération duSoudan avec le Tchadet cite aussi le Qatar, pointé régulièrement du doigt, mêmes par les autorités tchadiennes pour  “tentatives de déstabilisation” au point de rompre les relations diplomatiques il y a un an avant de reprendre en février 2018.
Pour suspendre cet hebdomadaire, la Hama a estimé que les liens établis n’étaient justifiées par “aucun fait ou élément matériel”.
Reporters Sans Frontières condamne cette sanction qu’il qualifie de disproportionnée et demande la levée de cette suspension. « La Hama a pour rôle de veiller à la déontologie et à l’éthique et non de s’ériger en tribunal des opinions. Si des personnes ou des Etats s’estiment être mis en cause, il existe des recours légaux comme la possibilité de faire publier un droit de réponse », déclare Arnaud Forger, responsable du bureau Afrique de RSF qui précise que, « l’analyse politique fait partie du champ applicable de plein droit à l’exercice du journalisme ».

Title: Miners blocked from working in S. Kordofan gold area - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Last week, gold miners were denied entrance to the gold exploration area north of Kadugli, the state capital. They were sent away by a military force on the pretext that the same area is owned by a foreign mining company.
Last week, gold miners were denied entrance to the gold exploration area north of Kadugli, the state capital. They were sent away by a military force on the pretext that the same area is owned by a foreign mining company.
A number of local gold miners told Radio Dabanga that members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in approximately 19 Land Cruisers drove them away from working in the mine wells on September 5.
The area is being explored by the Russian Kush for Exploration and Production Co. Ltd. (Kush E&P), one of the biggest gold producing companies in Sudan. The paramilitary force said to be acting in the name of Kush E&P.
According to one of the traditional gold miners last week: “The commander said that Kush owns the area and told us to leave.” Radio Dabanga spoke to residents in neighbourhoods in Bardab, Shaeer and Hijeirat villages who expressed their concern that they might have to leave the area because of it.
On Monday Kush E&P denied having ordered the blockade in a response to Radio Dabanga. “… in no way and by no means has our Company blocked or created any difficulties to any legal activities of local residents in the Kadugli area. […] Kush has no capability 'to tell anyone to leave',” the reply reads.
Sources on the ground confirmed to Radio Dabanga yesterday that the paramilitaries did not act in the name of Kush when it told the local miners to leave.
Kush denies interference
Kush E&P explained that it has partnered up with the local mining company Algunade, that communicates with local authorities in the name of Kush E&P and works with the police and the military on local security issues. Algunade did engage with “specialised military units for de-mining the license area” for a large-scale de-mining effort in the license area, and about 8 square kilometers have been de-mined north of Kadugli up to today.
Even if the government states that the areas provided for mining are unoccupied, “more frequently than not it is not the situation on the ground”. People live, farm or work these areas,” Kush E&P said, stating that: “The population of the villages mentioned in your inquiry has no reasons to be concerned about any need ‘to leave the area’.”
Kush E&P received six exploration licenses in South Kordofan from the Sudanese government, started field works on the so-called Block SK24 license area (253 square kilometers) immediately and constructed a field camp with 24-hour security.
The company has operated in Sudan’s eastern Red Sea state from 2013 onward, in an area called Block 30 with a total size of 4,426 square kilometers. Its website shows that the Russian company has plans to increase staff for the project, of which80 per centare Sudanese people.

Rejection
Concerns about the mining activities in South Kordofan have persisted, however. In August, people in Delling renewed their rejection of the ongoing mining operations in the region and called on companies to immediately leave. In a meeting, local leaders expressed claims that the region is for agriculture and pasture, where the mining companies have not provided any services.
People in the meeting said that two months ago Kush E&P arrived to run mining operations in the area north of Delling up to El Goz (further north of Kadugli). “The Russian company is […] moving under military protection, preventing any people from approaching to know what they are doing on the ground,” Professor Siddig Tawer, scientific adviser to the National Committee for Environmental Protection, said.
Tawer’s team, led by the Health Minister of South Kordofan, earlierinvestigated a reported increasein the number of miscarriages, the birth of deformed children, and cases of kidney failure in El Tadamon. These deteriorating health conditions are often attributed to the result of environmental pollution caused by the use of toxics during mining activities in the region.

Title: Feature: Protecting civilians in times of conflict - defenceWeb
In asymmetric wars, more needs to be done to protect people caught in the middle
A small bus loaded with 24 people from Burkina Faso was crossing into Mali, en route to a weekly market in the town of Boni. Nine kilometers from the market, the vehicle triggered a land mine planted by Malian insurgents.
All 24 people, including four babies and their mothers, were killed in the January 2018 incident.
It’s a common story. At least 600,000 African civilians in 27 countries have been killed in the past 20 years during conflicts, with millions more wounded and displaced. Countless others have died from the indirect results of conflict, including starvation.
Peacekeeping missions have a mixed record when it comes to protecting civilians. Mission mandates, training and policy are often inconsistent or ineffective at shielding the most vulnerable people from violence.
UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS
Jide Martuns Okeke and Paul D. Williams edited the 2017 book, Protecting Civilians in African Union Peace Support Operations: Key Cases and Lessons Learned. In it, they note that “it has often been challenging to generate consensus and guide coordination among stakeholders about what needs to be done, when and by whom.” The book also notes that “there is not always a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities … in ways that promote a collective understanding, approach and goals toward meeting the specific challenges of civilian protection.”“Assuming one can identify who are civilians and who are combatants, which is not always easy, the main challenges revolve around implementation and the issues of expectations, resources and the peacekeepers’ mindsets and their willingness to be proactive and take risks to protect civilians,” Williams told ADF. “The most dangerous situations are arguable where forces aligned to the government/host state are the ones causing harm to civilians. This puts peacekeepers in a very difficult situation as their presence depends on the legal consent of the host government.”
RIGHT-SIZING AND USING POLICE
The Darfur region of western Sudan is an example of peacekeepers at odds with the host government. In 2003, rebel groups took on the government of Sudan, alleging that the government discriminated against non-Arabs. The government responded by supporting a group of militias known as the Janjaweed, which means “devils on horseback.” The Janjaweed, often well-trained, looted and burned villages, polluted water sources, and murdered, tortured and raped civilians. The nongovernmental organization World Without Genocide says that more than 480,000 people have been killed, and more than 2.8 million have been forced to leave their homes as of 2018.
In 2004, the African Union established the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) specifically to protect civilians in Darfur. Initially, 150 Soldiers were assigned to AMIS, which eventually expanded to 9,000 troops. That proved to be a fraction of the personnel needed. Although AMIS was criticized for its logistical problems, delays and lack of capacity, its real problem was that its force was too small to deal with Darfur’s problems.
In 2007, AMIS was replaced with the far-larger African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). As of the end of 2017, the mission had 2,873 civilians, 11,005 troops, 152 experts, 2,731 police, 292 staff members and 121 U.N. volunteers.
A U.N. resolution adopted in 2014 specifically spells out the duties of UNAMID personnel regarding civilians. It requires the mission to “protect civilians, without prejudice to the responsibility of the Government of Sudan.”
Researchers John Ahere, Olivia Davis and Irene Limo say UNAMID police units have focused on four things: acting as a go-between to minimize differences between UNAMID operations and Sudan’s own police force, capacity building, community policing, and details such as program evaluations.

The three researchers say that local perceptions of UNAMID’s civilian protection go far beyond personal safety. Darfur civilians, they say, believe that civilian protection includes the continuous provision of health care and reliable access to food, water and medicine.“No matter how many other tasks are undertaken by the peacekeepers, their mission will not be successful while the basic needs of civilians are not met,” the researchers concluded.
The Darfur intervention had its roots in a 2001 report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. The commission was a response to then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s question of when the international community must intervene for humanitarian purposes. The commission said that sovereignty not only gave a country the right to control its affairs, it also gave a country primary responsibility for protecting its citizens. The commission asserted that when a country fails to protect its people, through a lack of ability or lack of will, the responsibility shifts to the international community.
In creating the Darfur mission, the U.N. stipulated that it should have “a predominantly African character and the troops should, as far as possible, be sourced from African countries.” As of the end of 2017, the countries providing the most Soldiers and police to the mission were Rwanda with 2,424 and Ethiopia with 2,400.
One hallmark of UNAMID has been its use of formed police units (FPUs). As defined by the U.N., an FPU consists of about 140 police officers trained and equipped “to act as a cohesive unit capable of accomplishing policing tasks that individual police officers could not address.” A well-trained, well-disciplined unit can operate effectively even in “high-risk” situations such as Darfur. FPUs have three defined responsibilities: maintaining law and order; protecting U.N. personnel, equipment and facilities; and standard policing operations that do not involve threats to the military.
CHANGING THE MANDATE
The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) originated in January 2007 as a peacekeeping force in the country’s insurgency. The mission originally had no formal strategy to protect civilians. Williams, an associate professor at The George Washington University, noted that AMISOM delayed adopting a formal policy of protecting civilians, known as PoC, because it also was charged with protecting its own personnel. “Adopting a PoC mandate was thus thought likely to raise local expectations without necessarily providing the tools needed to meet them,” Williams wrote.“Particularly during its first four years, AMISOM had a distinctly ambiguous relationship with civilian protection issues,” noted Williams. “On the one hand, AMISOM was mandated to protect certain VIPs associated with the political reconciliation process; degrade al-Shabaab and other anti-government armed actors; and provide medical care, water supplies, electricity generators and humanitarian assistance to significant members of Mogadishu’s stricken civilians, because of the absence of humanitarian actors on the ground.”
The mission, he said, was even accused of harming civilians, “both directly, through instances of indiscriminate fire and the targeting of civilians who were mistaken for enemy fighters, and indirectly, by failing to protect others from al-Shabaab.”
That changed in 2014, in part because the mission was making progress and needed more help from Somali citizens. AMISOM decided that in order to promote reconciliation and create a safe space for national dialogue, it needed to do a better job of protecting clan leaders, religious leaders and civil society leaders.
There is still much room for improvement in Somalia. A U.N. report for 2016 and 2017 said that although al-Shabaab and clan militias were responsible for the majority of civilian casualties, state actors, including the army and police, were responsible for 11 percent. AMISOM, the report said, was responsible for 4 percent of the casualties.“Parties to the conflict are simply not doing enough to shield civilians from the violence,” U.N. Special Envoy to Somalia Michael Keating told Voice of America. “This is shameful.”
LESSONS LEARNED
The peacekeeping missions in Africa and elsewhere have provided some valuable lessons:
If PoC is a priority, say it clearly: Soldiers, police and civilians involved in peacekeeping missions need clear, direct instructions on the priority of PoC. If the directives of protecting civilians are not clear, that aspect of the mission will fail. Williams told ADF that “it is also important to have clear rules of engagement on the use of force” in protecting civilians. “However, discretion must be left to contingent commanders in the field to make the final call about how best to act in a particular crisis situation.”
Underfunded missions don’t work: Williams said that “a small under-resourced force which is unable to protect itself is hardly in a position to engage in proactive PoC activities.” In any mission, the peacekeepers must have the proper logistical, financial and human resources support to succeed. A clear mandate and consistent funding are critical to the protection of civilians and the success of such missions in general.
Civilians expect protection from peacekeepers: At the very least, peacekeepers should try to minimize threats to civilians in combat regions. In many cases, such as Darfur, civilians have higher expectations of PoC than the peacekeepers can deliver.
Patrols provide protection and information: Protecting civilians requires regular and consistent patrols and military escorts. In Darfur, UNAMID carried out 150 daily patrols to protect civilians, particularly women and children. The patrols were to allow the civilians to go about their daily lives. The operations also provided regular military escorts for aid workers, NGOs and humanitarian convoys. The patrols also enabled UNAMID to regularly assess security throughout the region.
Get buy-in from all the groups involved: A PoC mission requires an integrated missionwide approach to align military, civilian and police components. All the actors must have a clear vision of what their roles will be in protecting civilians.
Protecting civilians is complicated: A proper PoC mission has, by necessity, a complex structure with military, police and civilian components. Peacekeepers need to go into the mission properly equipped and properly trained. An effective mission includes a joint operations center. A rapid-response capability is an essential tool.
Understand the conflict and the threats to civilians: A PoC mission requires observation, record-keeping and information. Planners, managers and officers must have adequate data to analyze what’s working and what isn’t. A joint mission analysis center is a key tool. “What’s required is a threat assessment of potential civilian harm based on an accurate understanding of conflict dynamics,” Williams said.
Be flexible and be prepared to adapt: For example, if local police are inadequate, peacekeepers must be ready, and trained, to maintain public order. As a peacekeeping mission gains traction and warfare recedes, it’s important for all the players to change tactics to preserve civilian trust and support. UNAMID has relied on a number of strategies, including mobile operations bases, quick response units and early warning systems.
Be prepared for a long-term commitment: Unlike conventional warfare, Africa’s asymmetric wars seldom have a clean, specific ending. Groups such as al-Shabaab and Boko Haram can be beaten back, but have not, so far, gone away.

Title: 
Eritrea, South Sudan could join Eastern Africa Standby Force - Xinhua | English.news.cn

NAIROBI, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea and South Sudan could join the Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF), a regional force with rapid deployment capacity to combat security threats, an official said on Monday.
Eastern Africa Standby Force (EASF) Director Abdillahi Omar Bouh told Xinhua in Nairobi that the 10-member regional standby force is set to have a council of ministers meeting in December in Sudan where the approval process could be activated.
"Eritrea and South Sudan will have to present an official request to the council of ministers to join," Bouh said. "We see no reason to reject the application unless a member state objects to the application."
Since 2013, South Sudan has enjoyed observer status in the multinational standby force. The current membership of the organization includes Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda.
The multi-dimensional standby force with military, police and civilian components is ready to intervene in case of an emerging crisis, with its 5,300 pledged forces, Bouh said.
The force only intervenes at the request of the African Union as a last resort, in any country facing a crisis in eastern Africa after political dialogue and other mechanisms fail, he said.
The EASF has been in existence since 2004 for the purpose of enhancing peace, security and stability in the region, Bouh noted.

Title: Une formation militaire "pour sauvegarder" les éléphants de Zakouma - BBC News Afrique
Crédit photo,Getty Images
Avec le Prince Harry comme président, African Parks prend en charge des parcs nationaux dans neuf pays et donne aux rangers une formation de type militaire pour protéger certaines espèces menacées de disparition par un braconnage sauvage.
La BBC s'est rendue au Tchad, à la recherche du dernier troupeau d'éléphants du parc de Zakouma.
Il aura fallu trois heures de vol dans un petit avion, de N'Djamena, la capitale du Tchad, au parc national de Zakouma, puis trois heures de route pour retrouver les derniers éléphants du parc.
Des dizaines de milliers d'éléphants vivaient dans cette réserve couvrant 3 800 kilomètres carrés, mais pendant des siècles, c'est également ici que les cavaliers soudanais sont venus s'approvisionner en ivoire très convoité par les commerçants arabes le long du Nil.
À l'origine, ils chassaient avec des lances et des épées, mais les fusils d'assaut AK47 modernes ont permis de tuer massivement. Les mercenaires Janjaweed de Dafur, dans l'ouest du Soudan, continuent d'être des braconniers tenaces.
Aujourd'hui, les éléphants se déplacent rapidement, et après des siècles de chasse, courent s'ils voient, ou même sentent, des humains.
Zakouma a perdu 90 % des 22 000 éléphants qui évoluaient dans le parc au milieu des années 1970.
Au début des années 2000, la guerre avec la Libye et la recrudescence de la demande d'ivoire ont réduit la population à 4 300, et le chaos de la guerre civile l'a réduit à moins de 500 en 2010.
Des Rangers ont été tués, des animaux massacrés en masse, et les éléphants de Zakouma auraient pu disparaitre.
Mais au cours des dernières années, une transformation incroyable a eu lieu.
En moins d'une décennie, une organisation privée à but non lucratif a changé la donne.
"Nous avons des gardes forestiers. En raison de la menace à laquelle ils sont confrontés, ils sont entraînés par les militaires», explique Leon Lamprecht, directeur du parc de Zakouma.
"Mais ils font appliquer la loi et pas d'opérations militaires, nous essayons d'arrêter les braconniers avant qu'ils ne tuent les animaux que nous protégeons."
African Parks gère 13 aires protégées dans neuf pays à l'invitation des gouvernements qui manquent du personnel ou des ressources nécessaires pour protéger leur propre faune.

Title: #MeToo campaign for Sudanese teen highlights the need to end Western saviorism | NationofChange
Noura Hussein, who was sentenced to death in Sudan for killing "rapist husband," was recently changed to five years in prison because of “Sudanese activists, themselves raising the profile of this case, is what [got the attention of] international circles."
On June 27, Sudanese activists and the global human rights community declared victory when a 19-year old Sudanese woman, Noura Hussein,wasspared the death penalty. She was instead sentenced to a five-year prison sentence for murdering her husband in self-defense, as he tried to rape her when she was16 years old.
After news of the court’s initial decision for the death penalty broke in early May,Sudanese activists quickly took to Twitter and Facebookwith the hashtags #SaveNoura and #JusticeforNoura. Within a week, the story caught the attention of major international organizations like UN Women, Amnesty International and the EuropeanUnion, who allissued statementsagainst the ruling. A Sudanese diaspora blogger inspired aChange.org petitionthat received close to 1.7 million signatures worldwide. Celebrities like Rose McGowan, Emma Watson, Naomi Campbell and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Guillard alsoused their platforms to speak out.
Within a few weeks, a higher Sudanese court repealed the death sentence to a still-shocking five-year prison sentence.Sudan’s prisonsare known for their brutality and instances of unbridled torture.
The subsequent headlines from international media outlets described the win as a triumph of the international human rights community and the #MeToo movement over a waning Sudanese regime that has repressed its people for almost30years, eager to appease Western governments. Assuming the case was closed, international attention turned to other horrors.
Unfortunately, the case isn’t closed. It reemerged last week — registering only a blip on the international radar — when a government prosecutorfiled an appealto have Noura’s death penalty sentence reinstated. What’s more, Noura isn’t an isolated case.Wini Omer, a high profile women’s rights activist in Sudan who campaigned on behalf of Noura, was jailed for over a week around the time of Noura’s sentencing. A police officer arrested her because he simply “didn’t like the way she walked,” which led to charges of prostitution and crimes against the state. She now potentially faces capital punishment.
While the attention #MeToo brought to Noura’s case led to a positive outcome, the notion of “saving a life” without giving light to the structural causes that enabled her oppression in the first place must be called into question. “All of the assumptions [of Westerners] about women in theEast and Africa accidentally played a positive role in Noura’s case,” said Amgad Fareid Eltayeb, an activist with Sudan Change Now, the group that raised the profile of the initial sentencing. “Noura had a genuine cause, and the campaign had a victory. But what the campaign achieved is a small thing in the scales of [the abuses] that are actually happening,” he continued.
The Western human rights legal approach generally takes the horrors and injustices of the Nouras of the world case by case, with some harmful assumptions that create an “us” and “them” dynamic. Yet, there is far more interplay and collusion between Western governments and oppressive regimes like the Sudanese governmentthan face value might suggest. For example, the European Union hasfunneled millions of dollarsinto Sudan for “border security” in order to stop the flow of African migrants into Europe.These fundshave gone directly to the Rapid Support Forces, formerly known as theJanjaweed, which are the same militias that carried out ethnic cleansing campaigns in Darfur (in western Sudan) and who systematically use rape as a weapon of war.
The flash-in-the-pan activism of Noura’s case also begs some questions around the #MeToo movement’s ability to support long-term change and to truly challenge entrenched systems of racism, colonialism and patriarchy, especially when it comes to women in theGlobal South. While activism has become increasingly in vogue in the West, there is a danger that this mode of change simply replicates the same white (or Western) savior complex as the charity-driven humanitarianism that preceded it.
Western countries have flourished because of the violence and destructiontheycarried out to build their societies,and theycontinue to becomplicitbyfailingto take responsibility for this past. “The white man’s burden should notbe the motivation to act,”Eltayebsaid. “It should be the culpability of 400 years of colonization that stopped the progress of the civilizations in the Global South that led to the situation in our countries now.” Action driven by guilt can be fleeting, but action driven by a sense of conviction and obligation can put societies on much more equal footing.
“Sudanese activists, themselves raising the profile of this case, is what [got the attention of] international circles… Without them, Noura would not be here today,” Eltayeb continued.“Public opinion has begun to shift and recognize that, at least for cases like Noura, it was a clear act of self-defense. This creates openings for more debate, butno laws or policies changedas a result ofNoura’s case.”
Noura’s victory indicates that Sudanese activists are having some success changing the understanding of women’s rights domestically in a way that could enable more systemic change to take hold. The fact that Noura’s story spread so quickly on social and independent media outlets in Sudan is a testament to the effective, decentralized organizing of Sudanese activists, especially women.
Noura’s case became known because an audacious female journalist, Tahani Abbas,quietly followed her legal proceedings from the onset through the death penalty sentencing—interviewing her, visiting her in prison and risking her own safety to do so. The “No Oppression for Women” movement in Sudan stood ready to push out news of Noura’s case once the court made its ruling. The day of her death penalty sentencing, this women’s group also staged a sit-in in front of the court.
Other activist groups like Sudan Change Now helped amplify and spread the #SaveNoura and #JusticeforNoura messages. Opinion editorials, media articles and petitions followed, ultimately reaching an international audience.Thisin turnhelped expose new strategic openings for the domestic movement. “One of the lessons learned from this campaign is the regime’s growing concern of theirimage in the West. We can use this leverage in the future,” explained Fatima, who was active in Noura’s campaign (andwhosename has beenchanged for security).
But rather than coincidentally playing off each other, Sudanese and outside activists alike could coordinatemore intentionallyin the future. One place to start is recognizing that it is not simply an act ofgood will but an obligation to supportand work in partnership withNoura, Tahani, Wini, Fatima and the other Sudanese women on the frontlines. Their names should be known outside of Sudan so they can continue to be uplifted and recognized as heroes in theglobal #MeToo movement. They continue to risk their lives far after international attention deflects to other atrocities.
At the same time,Westerners are responsible for holding their governments accountable for perpetuating a system that allows these atrocities to happen. Otherwise, there will continue to be more Nouras of the world than social media can work to “save.” This will enable us to root our work, connect our struggles and pave a path towards more authentic solidarity.
