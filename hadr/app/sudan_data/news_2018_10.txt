Darfur,  historical region of the Billād al-Sūdān (Arabic: “Land of the Blacks”), roughly corresponding to the westernmost portion of present-daySudan. It lay between Kordofan to the east and Wadai to the west and extended southward to theAl-Ghazāl(Gazelle) River and northward to theLibyan Desert.
Darfur consists of animmenserollingplainthat has an area of approximately 170,000 square miles (440,000 square km). The volcanic highlands of theMarrah Mountainsdominate the central part of this plain. The Marrah Mountains have an average elevation of 7,200 feet (2,200 metres), with the highest peak,Mount Marrah, rising to 10,131 feet (3,088 metres). Elsewhere the sparsely populated plains of Darfur are relatively featureless and arid, particularly in the north, where they merge into the Libyan Desert. Soils, which are generally stony or sandy, support some seasonal grass and low thorny shrubs with tropical maquis vegetation. The Marrah highlands receive heavier rainfall than other parts of Darfur, and a number of large wadis (seasonal watercourses) rise in the mountains and flow southward across the plains.
Arabshave longconstitutedthe majority of the population in the northern part of Darfur, while Arabs andFurhave predominated in the southern portion. Other ethnic groups have included theBeja, Zaghawa, Nubian, and Daju peoples. Heavy rainfall in the Marrah highlands permits the intensive cultivation of cereals, rice, and fruits. Crops grown at other locations in the southern part of Darfur include sorghum, millet, sesame, peanuts (groundnuts), other root crops, and vegetables. In the arid north, camels, sheep, and goats are raised. Traditional handicrafts include leatherwork, wood carving, and carpet weaving.NyalaandAl-Fāshirare the principal towns.
In prehistoric times the northern inhabitants of Darfur were related to the predynastic peoples of the Nile River valley. From roughly 2500bceDarfur was probably within the sphere of the Egyptiancaravansthat traded southward from Aswān. Its first traditional rulers, the Daju (Dagu), may have been connected with ancientEgypt, and trade was no doubt conducted from Darfur both with Egypt during the New Kingdom and with the cities ofNapataandMeroein the kingdom ofKush(Cush; now in northern Sudan). The rule of the Daju in Darfur was eventually followed by that of the Tunjur, or Tungur.
The Christian period, which probably lasted from 900 to 1200 in Darfur, was ended by the advance of Islam eastward from the empire ofKanem-Bornu(centred on Lake Chad). By 1240 the king of Kanem was claiming control of a trade route with Egypt that extended eastward as far as Sai, and it is from this date that the influence of Kanem and Bornu on Darfur probably derived. Indeed, Darfur may have been a province of either Kanem or Bornu at one time or another during their great periods.
TheKeira, a chiefly clanaffiliatedwith the Fur, ruled Darfur from approximately 1640 to 1916. The first historical mention of the nameFuroccurred in 1664. During that period the kings of the Keira sultanate of Darfur apparently used the term Fur to refer to the region’s dark-skinned inhabitants who accepted both their Islamic religion and their rule. As the Keiradynastyitself intermarried, its members also became known as Fur. The inhabitants of Darfur were completely Islamized under the rule of the Keira sultans. The sultans fought intermittently with theWadaikingdom and also tried to subjugate the semi-independent Arab tribes that inhabited the country.
In the 1870s Darfur came under Egyptian rule and was given provincial status. Various revolts were suppressed by the Egyptians, and in 1881Rudolf Karl Slatinwas appointed governor. Though he defended the province against the forces ofal-Mahdī, a religious reformer and Sudanese political leader, he ultimately wasobligedto surrender to him in December 1883. Darfur was thereafter incorporated into al-Mahdī’s dominions. Following the overthrow of al-Mahdī’s successor, thekhalīfah(caliph)ʿAbd Allāh, in 1898, the new (Anglo-Egyptian) government of the Sudan recognized ʿAli Dīnār assultanof Darfur (1899). A rebellion led by ʿAli Dīnār in 1915 provoked the British to launch a punitive expedition, in which he was killed (November 1916). Thereafter Darfur became a province (and later three provinces) of the Sudan.
Ethnic tensions, long simmering between nomadic Arab herders and sedentary Fur and other agriculturalists, began erupting into armed conflict in the late 1980s. The violence, although bloody, generally wassporadicuntil 2003, when rebels from among the agriculturalists attacked government installations to protest what they contended was the Sudanese government’s disregard for the western region and its non-Arab population. The government inKhartoumresponded by creating an Arabmilitiaforce—which came to be known asJanjaweed(also Jingaweit or Janjawid)—that began attacking the sedentary groups in Darfur. Within a year, tens of thousands of people (primarily Fur and other agriculturalists) had been killed, and hundreds of thousands had fled westward torefugeecamps in neighbouring Chad; many others remained internally displaced. Despite a 2004 cease-fire and the presence ofAfrican Union(AU) troops that followed, by 2007 the conflict and resulting humanitarian crisis had grown, leaving hundreds of thousands of people dead and more than two million displaced. On July 31, 2007, theUnited Nations Security Councilauthorized a joint UN-AU peacekeeping mission (UNAMID) to replace the AU mission, although UNAMID troop deployment did not begin until 2008.
In July 2008 anInternational Criminal Court(ICC) prosecutor sought a warrant for the arrest of Sudanese presidentOmar al-Bashir, alleging that heborecriminal responsibility for the crisis in Darfur and accusing him of orchestrating the genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity occurring in the region. The Sudanese government rejected the allegations and proclaimed Bashir’s innocence. On March 4, 2009, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bashir, charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity but not with genocide; a second warrant for that charge was later issued on July 12, 2010.
In spite of the presence of UNAMID troops, conflict in Darfur was not eliminated. It intensified after the Sudanese government launched its “Decisive Summer” military campaign against rebellions throughout the country beginning in late 2013. The campaign, which reached Darfur in 2014, saw the use of a new government security unit known as the Rapid Support Force (RSF), which many compared to the Janjaweed in terms of lawlessness of tactics—perhaps not surprising, since the RSF appeared to have many former Janjaweed fighters among its ranks. In 2014 the UN noted that more than 3,000 villages in Darfur had been burned to the ground, and widespread sexual violence against Darfur civilians was reported. The ongoing conflict led to a worsening humanitarian crisis, which was furtherexacerbatedby the Sudanese government’s restrictions on humanitarian aid groups.

According to a recent report by the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) various developments contributed to the deterioration of the security situation in Darfur last year.The New York-based activist centre points in its latest report, Militia Chaos in Darfur: What’s Next?, to the major disarmament campaign the Sudanese government launched in the western regions in August 2017, fighting between paramilitaries and rebel combatants in Darfur, and the downsizing of UN-AU Mission in Darfur (Unamid).
According to a recent report by the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) various developments contributed to the deterioration of the security situation in Darfur last year.
The New York-based activist centre points in its latest report,Militia Chaos in Darfur: What’s Next?, to the major disarmament campaign the Sudanese government launched in the western regions in August 2017, fighting between paramilitaries and rebel combatants in Darfur, and the downsizing of UN-AU Mission in Darfur (Unamid).
“In a political move aimed at creating an impression of government control and defusing tensions in Darfur, Khartoum announced a campaign in August 2017 under Presidential Decree No. 419 (2017) to collect weapons and legitimize the ownership of smuggled vehicles in the states of Darfur and Kordofan,” the report reads.
Thousands of members of the Rapid Support Forces(RSF), Sudan’s main militia, were stationed in Darfur to carry out thecollection of illegal arms and unregistered vehicles.
Notorious janjaweed leader Musa Hilal and his fighters who refused to give up their weaponswere arrested.
Between May and November 2017, more than 400 members of the RSF and rebel movements were killed and more than 330 were wounded. At least 230 rebel combatants were taken prisoner.
After tribal clashes between Ma‘aliya and Rizeigat tribesmen in East Darfur,more than 40 leaders of the warring tribes were arrestedunder the State of Emergency. They were transferred to prisons in Port Sudan and Khartoum North. “Transfer to other governorates is akin to exile,” the African Centre states.
The report further lists the killing of four displaced peoplein Kalma camp in South Darfurwhen government forces fired at a peaceful demonstration against the announced visit of President Al Bashir to the camp.
In 2017, Unamid began its withdrawal from the region, and handed 11 basesto the authorities in the region.

Title: Lol community youth vow to work as peace ambassadors - Sudan Tribune

October 28, 2019 (LOL) – Youth from the Lol community in Northern Bahr el Ghazal region have vowed to work as peace ambassadors.
This was at a special training session organized by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) for young people in the region.
The training, UNMISS said, was to help the youth understand the revitalized peace agreement and they play a role in conflict management by sharing grievances, experiences and solutions.
“We should know that all of us are South Sudanese regardless of our tribes, our clans and our religion,” said 27-year old Thomas Thiep Ngor.
“If we can do away with this mentality of being used by the leaders and try to live a positive life, I believe South Sudan will be one of the peaceful countries,” he added.
Participants at the workshop reportedly called for increased representation in the peace agreement and the peace process more broadly.
“In the records, I did not find exactly the context where the youth are represented,” said 31-year-old Ajou Noon.
“There is no point of youth representation in this current peace agreement,” he added.
The young leaders promised to spread messages of peace back in their villages to help create momentum for change in the country which has suffered immensely from five years of civil war.
“I will also tell my community that we, the youth, should cooperate together and work to solve our problems among ourselves,” said 23-year-old, Selina Areng Dut.
The Gomjuer Center Commissioner said the training by UNMISS’ Civil Affairs Division provided an important opportunity to educate young people in the area about the peace process and to enable them to participate in an informed way.
“What you have given to these youth is a good product,” said Salva Chol. “They will help circulate the full knowledge of peace.”
Meanwhile, the peacekeeping mission in Aweil will reportedly organize similar training for youth in other parts of the region over the coming weeks.

Title: Sudan Human Rights Commission head laments ‘violations by organs of the regime’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Human rights violations by Sudanese security and military forces are creating challenges for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the Commission’s head Iman Fathelrahman has acknowledged.
Human rights violations by Sudanese security and military forces are creating challenges for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the Commission’s head Iman Fathelrahman has acknowledged.
Speaking in an interview with the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA), Fathelrahman said that “the individual violations by some members of the organs of the regime are harmful and are working to defeat the human rights situation…”. She said that “the Sudanese state will be held accountable by its control over its institutions”.
Fathelrahman was reacting torecent comments by the commander of Sudan’s main paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), denying involvement of RSF militiamen in attacks against the civilian population; specificallyaccusations of RSF militiamen shaving the heads of youths in Khartoum.
Head shaving
Last month, Radio Dabanga reported that RSF paramilitaries were shaving men by force in the districts of El Haj Yousef, El Tawidat, El Karton, and El Radmiyat, as part of “the fight against negative phenomena”.
They were targeting youths, especially those with haircuts like famous soccer players.
Activists condemned the campaign on social media. Some call it “a terrorist attack”, others “a violation of human dignity” pointing to “human rights guaranteed by international charters”.
She stressed that there are some violations from the state institutions of law enforcement, and that the behaviour of some individuals or groups within these institutions and organs are challenges for the commission.
Controversy
Hamdan’s recent public statements on national TVhave courted controversy. In an interview withSudanese television Channel 24broadcast on Tuesday evening, the militia commander said that the Governor of North Kordofan, Ahmed Haroun’s place is in jail rather than the state government for “bringing us [the RSF] into disrepute”. The interview was quickly banned and the programme suspended by the security apparatus.
Ironically, the target of Hamdan’s Haroun is subject to an international arrest warrant as he has been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity which he allegedly committed in Darfur.

Title: Sudanese women call to amend gender discriminatory laws - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
A group of Sudanese women chant slogans near the home of a demonstrator who died during anti-government in February 2019 (Reuters photo)October 25, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese women representatives across the country have called on the transitional government to review laws violating women’s rights discriminating women.
65 female delegates from different Sudanese regions held a three-day meeting from 17 to19 October in Khartoum to discuss common social and political concerns of women in Khartoum after the Sudanese revolution.
The meeting was organized by the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA Network) and attended by the Minister of Social Development and Labour, Lena al-Sheikh Mahjoub and Minister of Justice, Nasr-al-Din Abdel Bari.
In a statement extended to Sudan Tribune on Friday, SIHA said the participants called developing and enforcing policies and legislation that ensures women’s integral role in achieving food security, poverty reduction, and access to health services, education and housing.
Further, they asked the transitional government to repeal and amend “laws that discriminate and violate women’s rights, such as the Criminal law and Personal Status Law;” and to adopting a comprehensive transitional justice programme for combating violence against men and women in conflict areas.
The meeting, also, called on the government to take the needed steps to ratify the “Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and fulfilling all obligations that promote the rights of women in international charters and conventions”.
Sudan is the only country in the Arab League that did not join the CEDAW.
This week a group of Islamist women handed over a letter to the justice minister called to not ratify the convention on women’s rights saying it violates the Islamic laws.
Also, Sudan’s former foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour who is now the chairman of the National Congress Party said in a post on his Facebook page that the CEDAW is the treaty
For his part, said the National Congress Party Ibrahim Ghandour, on his “Facebook” that CEDAW is the treaty is the world’s most harmful document that targets Islam in its constants and can distort the Sudanese culture.
SIHA said that Ministers Mahjoub and Abdel Bari “pledged to make fundamental amendments and committed to the ratification and domestication of all laws and mechanisms that improve the status of women”.

Title: RSF, ex-rebels arrest more displaced in North Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
A number of people have been detained by militiamen in Sortony camp in Kabkabiya in North Darfur. This is the second incident this month involving the militiamen and displaced people.
A number of people have been detained by militiamen in Sortony camp in Kabkabiya in North Darfur. This is the second incident this month involving the militiamen and displaced people.
Witnesses reported to Radio Dabanga that members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and militiamen led by former rebel El Sadig El Fakka detained seven camp residents this week.
The men entered Sortony driving five vehicles and seized seven persons from their residences. According to a source, they have been taken to the forces’ camp in Kobe, one kilometre away from Sortony camp.
El Fatih Ishag, Eisa Bashar, Abdelrazig Saleh, Mousa Karigat, and Abdelrazig Yousef were among those detained this week.
The number of detainees adds to the earlier reported 21 other displaced people who have been detained by the militiamen for weeks.Last week a community sheikh reportedthat on August 12, a joint force of militiamen of the RSF and El Sadig Fakka group stormed the camp and detained 18 displaced people accused of being affiliated with the Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW).
On September 18, basic school teacher and head of the Youth Association in the camp, Abdallah Bundug, and teacher and deputy head Jamal Nimir, along with a third camp resident were detained as well.
In Sudan, RSF and Military Intelligence members are known to detain people who are accused of having connections with rebel movements.
Jebel Marra
El Fakka’s group consists of a number of rebel combatants who recently split from the SLM-AW. The movement recently announced an unilateral three-month ceasefire in a certain part of Jebel Marra, to allow for aid assistance. According to UNhumanitarian coordinators, “the Government of Sudan and Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdel Wahid [El Nur] are facilitating access to the affected area”.
Sortony, adjacent to the base of the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping Mission in Darfur (Unamid), is a site where people displaced from the mountainous Jebel Marra in Darfur in early 2016 have sought refuge. Increased hostilities between the Sudanese army, assisted by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and the Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur have forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes to other areas in Darfur, including Sortony.
According to the UN, the number of displaced living in Sortony decreased to 21,500 people who are registered and currently reside at the site.

Title: Sudan's inflation rises slightly in September - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudanese women shop at a clothing and textile market in Khartoum in March 2013 – (Ilya Varlamov Photo)October 10, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Sudan’s inflation rate for September slightly increased to 53.35% in urban areas compared to 53.13 in August 2019, the official statistics agency said on Thursday.
The Central Bureau of Statistics attributed the reasons for this slight increase to the stability of prices of food and beverage and the decline in meat prices during the last month.
The statement pointed out that the rate of inflation in urban areas during September reached 51.3%, compared to 50.39% last August.
For its part,  the rate of inflation in rural areas reached 54.98%, according to the agency.
Inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) which is defined as the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services that are purchased by specific groups of households.
In a related development, the US dollar remained stable against the Sudanese pound as the USD buying rate remained at 70 and the selling rate at 71 pounds.
Traders and retail clients consumers are reluctant to sell foreign currencies expecting an increase in the exchange rate in the coming days, especially as the government failed to get foreign financial assistance so far and nothing on the horizon as well.
Ahmed Al-Hadi, a dealer told Sudan Tribune that the sale of foreign currencies is currently very weak and confined to students travelling abroad or families that support their sons and girls studying in foreign universities, in addition to some employees working in international institutions and companies.

Title: Sudan: RSF commander’s ‘North Kordofan governor should be in jail’ interview banned - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The commander of Sudan’s main paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), has said in a TV interview that the Governor of North Kordofan should be in jail for “bringing us into disrepute”. The interview was quickly banned and the programme suspended by the security apparatus.
The commander of Sudan’s main paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), has said in a TV interview that the Governor of North Kordofan should be in jail for “bringing us into disrepute”. The interview was quickly banned and the programme suspended by the security apparatus.
In an interview withSudanese television Channel 24broadcast on Tuesday evening, militia commander Hemeti said that the governor of North Kordofan, Ahmed Haroun’s place is in jail rather than the state government.
He accused the opposition dignitaries and a group within the government of ‘conspiring to seek to discredit his forces’.
‘Disrepute’
The defiant commander suggested that the Governor of North Kordofan should be in jail for “bringing the RSF into disrepute”.
In 2014, the residents of El Obeid took part in a mass demonstration, demanding the expulsion of the RSF which had allegedly carried out acts of murder, rape, and theft against the residents of the state. At the time, Governor Ahmed Haroun issued a statement in which he apologised to the residents and issued a decision to expel them from the state.
Ironically, Haroun is subject to an international arrest warrant as he has been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity which he allegedly committed in Darfur.
Head shaving
In reaction to reports about RSF paramilitaries who began toshave men by force in Khartoum North in Septemberas part of “the fight against negative phenomena”, the commander confirmed that video clips shown depicted some of his militiamen shaving young people in the streets, however he said that “it was done years ago against some Minni-Minawi affiliate”.
Hemeti boasted of RSF involvement in investments to finance their work.
In Khartoum, dozens of youths and residents of the districts of El Haj Yousef, El Jereif, and Kalakla have complained of being beaten and cursed and their heads being shaved by the Rapid Support Militia.
Programme suspended
In response to the broadcast, on Wednesday the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) suspended theState of the Nationprogramme. Presenter Tahir Hasan El Tom said on his Facebook account that “the state programme will be absent from its viewers because of directives issued by the security and intelligence services”, which summoned him and notified him of the fact. He is also being investigated personally.
Ongoing media curbs
The Media in Sudan are continuously subjected to confiscations of newspapers, and summons and detentions of journalists.
In the end of June, the cabinet extended the power of the government-controlled Press and Publications Council as well as restrictions on the media to online news outlets, when itpassed amendments of the Media and Publication Act. A month later, the NISSrestored prior-censorship of newspapers.
In early August, editors-in-chief and the head of the NISS in Khartoumagreed in a meetingto form a committee to deliberate on the so-called red lines set by the security apparatus for Sudanese media. New confiscations of newspapers were therefore briefly suspended.
However, the NISSbegan gagging the press again on August 27, when the print-runs of El Jareeda and El Tayyar were confiscated. No explanations were given.Four days later, NISS officers stopped the distribution ofEl Jareeda andEl Tayyaragain, together with the print-run ofEl Rai El Aam,without stating a reason.
Abdelaziz told Radio Dabanga at the time that “in the past there used to be ‘red lines’not to criticise the president or vice-presidents of Sudan, members of the security apparatus, and the police. However, these lines have become very unclear and unpredictable now”.
In early September,three young journalistswere summoned by security agents in Khartoum and El Gedaref. A Sudanesereporter was bannedfrom writing. The print-run ofEl Saihadaily, the newspaper he was writing for, was confiscated on September 8.
Sudan is ranked at the bottom of the World Press Freedom Index byReporters Without Borders.

Human rights activist Najda Mansour said in an interview with Radio Dabanga that the initiative, which was launched yesterday, means the establishment of a new approach to work, dialogue, and build partnerships with actors seeking to build a movement of rights and freedoms in the country.
She stressed that the initiative is based on combating human rights violations committed by the government, based on Article 27 contained in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution and Article 142 of the National Human Rights Commission.
Complaints, violations
The head of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Iman Fathelrahman, reported at a workshop last week that the Commission has daily been receiving a large number of complaints and inquiries from citizens about their rights and how to claim them.
She said the office of complaints and monitoring of the Office of the High Commission is “the bridge or artery connecting the Commission with the public". She pointed out that the workshop is aimed at how to monitor and follow up on human rights".
Earlier this month, Fathelrahman acknowledged that human rights violations by Sudanese security and military forces are creating challenges for the NHRC.
Speaking in an interview with the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA),she saidthat “the individual violations by some members of the organs of the regime are harmful and are working to defeat the human rights situation…”. She said that “the Sudanese state will be held accountable by its control over its institutions”.
Fathelrahman was reacting torecent comments by the commander of Sudan’s main paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan (aka Hemeti), denying involvement of RSF militiamen in attacks against the civilian population; specificallyaccusations of RSF militiamen shaving the heads of youths in Khartoum.
National Association
In October as well, prominent Sudanese lawyer Nabil Adib announced the establishment of the National Association for Those Affected by Violations of the Rights of Free Movement, Free Expression, and Free Press in Khartoum.
In a press conference on October 10,he called on civil society organisationsto urgently act to defend human rights and civic freedoms in Sudan, because “the level of human rights violations in Sudan cannot be tolerated any more”.

Witnesses confirmed that the force commander ordered the arrest of the soldier accused of the attempted rape in an attempt to calm the situation.
Bashir was taken to Muzbad hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds.
According to reports that have not been unequivocally confirmed, Osama Mukhtar and Yasir Ali, two companions who took Bashir to hospital, were subsequently arrested from inside the hospital by militia members.

The local official in charge of the Jebel Amer gold mine in El Sareif locality in North Darfur has issued a decision whereby he dissolved the Native Committee for Mining and the police have ordered  the administrative staff to immediately leave, after Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militiamen seized raw gold by force.
The local official in charge of the Jebel Amer gold mine in El Sareif locality in North Darfur has issued a decision whereby he dissolved the Native Committee for Mining and the police have ordered  the administrative staff to immediately leave, after Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militiamen seized raw gold by force.
Sources told Radio Dabanga that members of the RSF under the command of an officer named Abu Shouk allegedly loaded gold-bearing rocks onto four vehicles at night.
The militiamen than transferred them to nearby mining mills where they forced the owners of the mills to grind what they had seized.
Traditional mining
Jebel Amer is a major source of gold for Sudan. The raw gold is mined by traditional methods and should be sold via accredited dealers, however recent reports suggest that a large proportion of the gold produced by traditional mining methods in Sudan is beingsmuggled to neighbouring countries such as Egypt or Eritreabecause of poor prices offered by the Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS).
The Ministry of Oil and Minerals has acknowledged the smuggling of gold because of the lack of a rewarding price for the producers, and alleges the existence of large stored quantities of gold.

Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Chief of Police of Khartoum has denied any involvement in the campaign set-up by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the government’s main militia, to shave the heads of youths with “deviant hair styles”.On Monday, police chief Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Osman told the press in Khartoum that no policeman has forced young men to change their hair cuts.He reacted to reports about RSF paramilitaries who began to shave men by force in Khartoum North two weeks ago, as part of “the fight against negative phenomena”. They were targeting youths, “especially those with haircuts like famous soccer players”.
The Chief of Police of Khartoum has denied any involvement in the campaign set-up by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the government’s main militia, to shave the heads of youthswith “deviant hair styles”.
On Monday, police chief Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Osman told the press in Khartoum that no policeman has forced young men to change their hair cuts.
He reacted to reports about RSF paramilitaries who began toshave men by force in Khartoum North two weeks ago, as part of “the fight against negative phenomena”. They were targeting youths, “especially those with haircuts like famous soccer players”.
A few days later, young men reported from the densely-populated districts of East Soba and Kalakla in southern Khartoum, about similar practices by RSF members.
Osman urged “any citizen who has been shaved in this way to lodge a complaint at the nearest police station”.
Residents of El Haj Yousef and El Jireif West in Khartoum North told Radio Dabanga on Tuesday that the militia is continuing its campaign “until now”.
They reported that a force of RSF members entered the Soug Sitta market in El Haj Yousef “just before sunset” on Monday. Another force searched for young men with particular hair styles in the Naivasha market in El Jereif West.
Most youths have stopped going to clubs to watch soccer matches with their friends in the evening. “They now watch the matches at home,” a listener said.
“Schoolchildren are terrified by the militiamen,” he added. “They run away as soon as they see their vehicles.”
The sources all consider the aim of the campaign “to suppress and terrorise the youth and prevent them from moving around in the public arena”, instead of combating “negative phenomena”.

Title: ACJPS: Situation of Eritrean refugees in Sudan deteriorating - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Eritrean asylum seekers in eastern Sudanese refugee camps used to face excessive violence by the Sudanese police, and by human trafficking gangs who raid the camps to kidnap refugees. New developments have made their life even worse.The international community and Khartoum should intervene to reverse the increasingly widening area of human trafficking in eastern Sudan and mistreatment of Eritrean asylum seekers in the country, the New York-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) said in a report on Friday.
Eritrean asylum seekers in eastern Sudanese refugee camps used to face excessive violence by the Sudanese police, and by human trafficking gangs who raid the camps to kidnap refugees. New developments have made their life even worse.
The international community and Khartoum should intervene to reverse the increasingly widening area of human trafficking in eastern Sudan and mistreatment of Eritrean asylum seekers in the country, the New York-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) saidin a report on Friday.
According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the estimated number of Eritreans who enter the Sudan every month via these border crossings is about 2,500. Other UNHCR statistics put the number of Eritrean refugees in camps in Eastern Sudan (those fleeing compulsory conscription back home or looking for better opportunities elsewhere) to 2,000 monthly. Many of those refugees are smuggled into Khartoum, the Middle East, or Europe.
Militia, criminal courts
Illegal immigration and movement of human trafficking gangs in eastern Sudan became rampant between 2007 and 2014, ACJPS states. As the smuggling routes then changed because of political developments, and Sudan committed itself to halt the stream of refugees and migrants smuggled through its country to Egyptand Libya, Eritrean refugees have been increasingly brought before criminal courts and sent back to the country they fled – with dire consequences.
Eritreans who are forcibly deported to their country may be subjected to torture, and face imprisonment for up to 14 years, the African Centre says.
In June 2015, Adam Jamaa was appointed governor of Kassala state, bordering Eritrea. He soon announced his plans for addressing illegal immigration in eastern Sudan, by instructing theRapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main militia,to halt human traffickingin the region.
Criminal courts in the state began to issue orders to forcibly deport Eritrean refugees to their home country. A reliable source told ACJPS that Jamaa had personally directed the courts to do so, which, the research centre says, indicates coordination between Sudan and Eritrea governments concerning this issue.
In 2017, ACJPS recorded three court decisions, ordering the deportation of 170 Eritrean asylum seekers to their home country. The report further presents in detail 15 cases of abuse of Eritrean nationals by the Sudanese authorities.

Title: إذلال حميدتي للرجال وسوء المآل – صحيفة التغيير السودانية , اخبار السودان
صلاح شعيب
كثيرنا يدرك أن الجنجويد من أعراض الأزمة السودانية، وليسوا هم المرض بعينه. والمسؤول عنهم هو عمر البشير. ولكن المسؤولية الأكبر تعود لقادة الإخوان المسلمين جميعا، بمن فيهم البروفيسير محمد عثمان صالح. فإذا كانت أذرع النظام الإخواني تتطلب وجود جنجويد حماية فإن هيئة علماء السودان هم جنجويد تمكين ديني إيضا. وعند “الشخص الشفت” لا فرق في المحصلة العامة بين الفريق حميدتي والبروفيسير صالح.
ولكن الذين في فهوماتهم غشاوة ينخدعون، ويستغربون أن راعي جمال سابق أصبح فريقا. ولكن المشكلة ليست في راعي الجمل، أو الضأن في الخلاء أصلا، ولا يجوز ضرب المثل بجهلهما. وإنما تكمن المشكلة في النخبة التي استعانت بحميدتي، وهي من بعد لم يسعفها تأهيلها الأكاديمي الذي بعضه في أم القرى، وآخر في السوربون، بالتحلي بالاستقامة المعرفية فما بالنا بمن هو لم يكمل الثانوية. إذن فتعليم حميدتي، أو عدمه، ليس هو محك الجدل هنا، ذلك لو كانت تجاربنا السياسية دلت على أن كثيرا من المتعلمين أقذر منه. إن حق الجدل يكمن في التخطيط الشرير للإخوان المسلمين الذين هدموا الجيش القومي، واستعاضوا عنه بمليشيات هلال، وحميدتي.
إن البشير، بعون علي عثمان، وأكابر استراتيجيي الشر في النظام، نظموا هيكلية قوات الجنجويد مثلما فعلوا في السابق مع قوات موسى هلال الذي انقضت مهمته، ومهمة قواته، حين أحس النظام بخطورة أحلامه. وحميدتي، والذي أصبح فريقا يحييه الآن ضباط قادة أركان، درسوا في أكاديميات عسكرية عالمية، هو مجرد أراجوز. إنه يؤدي دوره المرسوم له. وعندما يحين أجله السياسي – العسكري يلقى مصير هلال، لا محالة. وفِي هذا لا يختلف حميدتي عن مثقفين كبار. كانوا جنجويد إدارة، وثقافة، وإعلام، ودبلوماسية، وفنون، وقانون. وحين أدوا دورهم الانتهازي لفظوا للشارع: عبد السميع عمر أحمد، وجلال علي لطفي، وَعَبَد العزيز شدو، ومحمد علي المرضي، وعبد الباسط سبدرات مثالا. كانوا جنجويد تشريع دستوري، وتأثيث قانوني، وهم أصلا ليسوا إسلاميين. تم تجنيدهم بذات الطريقة التي جند بها هلال، وحميدتي. وقبل هذين تم تجنيد رياك مشار، وكاربينو، وأروك طون، ولام أكول، لشق الحركة الشعبية.
وهكذا حددت الحركة الإسلامية السودانية أن رهطا من المثقفين التكنوقراط، وبعض قدامى الحزبيين، والمستقلين، رخيصون جدا في المحفل القومي. ولذلك اصطادت “جبادتها” كل من طلب وزارة، أو سفارة. ولو بدا هلال، وحميدتي، بجهلهما بتعاريج مسار السياسة، ولا يعرفان خفاياها جيدا، ولكن ما عذر أولئك الذين نالوا تعليما رفيعا، بينهم أساتذة علوم سياسية وانثروبولوجية..درسوا رسالية سقراط، وتعقلوها، ثم قاموا بتدريسها لتلاميذهم.؟

-٣-
من جهة أخرى،ما تفعله قوات حميدتي الآنلا يثير الغرابة لمن خبروا أفعالها في الريف. فهي أصلا قد استمرأت حرق القرى، وإذلال الرجال، واغتصاب النساء، في مناطق النزاع. وهذا الأمر يدركه كل من ينتمى للإخوان المسلمين، ومن لم ينتم. فقط أن ما فعلته في الهامش لم يجد التغطية الكافية، أو التضامن الضروري مع الضحايا. ولكنها في الخرطوم فقد تم توثيق انتهاكاتها بالقدر الذي جعل الناس يطلقون صافرة إنذار متأخرة. وهذا الذي يحدث من جرم تجاه مواطني العاصمة القومية يعمق الحماية للنظام، ولذلك لن يجد شجبا، لا من الصحافة المكبلة بقيودها الأمنية، ولا من هيئة علماء السودان، ولا من أئمة المساجد، ولا من السلفيين الذين يهجمون على الأسواق ليدينوا المواطن المسكين لكونه لا يتبع دينه، بينما يدركون حدود الصدع بكلمة الحق في وجه سلطان جائر. وكما قال المثل: ألمي حار ولا لعب قعونج. ذلك لأن فقه رجال الدين لا يبالي بإهانة الحاكم للمواطنين مهما سدر في الكبائر، مادام هو يمتلك مضاء السيف، وبالأقل معتقلات التعذيب النتنة. إذن فإن هؤلاء الذين يصدرون من موقع علماء الشريعة يعرفون جيدا أن مهاجمة أفعال الجنجويد تحتاج إلى ضمير يقظ، أما مهاجمة من يسمونهم الشباب العلمانيين فيحتاج فقط إلى مايكروفون تايواني الصنع.
مع الجهل السياسي الذي يرزح فيه حميدتي، وقواته، وغياب وعيهم الكامل بخطورة انتهاكات حقوق الإنسان، فإنهم يدركون أن مهمتهم مرتبطة بوجود النظام في السلطة، وتحديدا البشير. ولذلك فإنهم يستمدون هذه القوة من قدرته على لجم الأصوات التي لا تراجعه. ولذلك فإن نخبة الدولة المركزية، وقاعدة النظام، يدركون أصلا أن حصان حميدتي هو الأسود في الديربي. ولذلك لا يهم مستواه التعليمي، أو تأهيله العسكري، بقدر أهمية دوره في الحفاظ على الوضع كما هو. وبالتالي ينعم الجوقة بالأمن، ويحسون أن نساءهم الأربعة في الحرز، وأن تجارتهم مستقرة، وأن المكاسب الاقتصادية التي راكموها، والوضعيات المهنية، والاجتماعية، التي حصدوها في مأمن.

4
إن هذه التراجيديا الماثلة أمامنا في علاقة نخبة الخرطوم الحاكمة بحميدتي، ومن قبله مشار وهلال، هي من أعراض تفكك الدولة. خصوصا إذا نظرنا إلى وضعية جيشها الذي ما عادت كليته الحربية، وأكاديميته العسكرية، وبعثاته لأكاديمية ناصر بقادرة على أداء دوره المنوط به. فالمليشيات التي أعانت الحركة الإسلامية في توطيد أركانها منذ أيّام تكوين الدفاع الشعبي هي ما يريد بها الإخوان المسلمين استثمار التناقض لبناء دولة تكفل لهم وحدهم الاستمتاع بخيراتها. أما بقية السواد الأعظم فهو إلى الجحيم، وإن رفع أحدهم صوته فإن قوات حميدتي جاهزة لجلده، أو حلق رأسه بالسكين، أو اغتصابه، أو تجريد ممتلكاته.
إن التخلص من إذلال قوات حميدتي لأهل الريف،ولاحقا المدن، يكمن في التخلص من النظام الذي استعان بها، وهذا أمر ليس بالساهل. إنه يحتاج إلى فاعلية في العمل المعارض على مستوى الجبهات كافة. وكما نعلم أن التغيير لأوضاع مثل التي يعاني منها السودان يحتاج إلى نهوض جماعي للمتضررين الذين دفعوا ثمنا باهظا لحالة التشظي الوطني.
وحتى الآن لم تستبن أمامنا الإمكانية للتخلص من إرث دولة الإخوان المسلمين إذا أخذنا في الاعتبار غياب آلية التغيير المنشود. ومع ذلك فإننا نوقن أن رهان الإخوان المسلمين على الاستبداد ليس هو الحل للحفاظ على دولتهم التي قامت على أنقاض الدولة المركزية الموروثة. وفِي ذات الوقت هم يوقنون أن لا سبيل أمامهم لإصلاح الدولة ما دامت شروط الإصلاح تعني الاعتراف بفشلهم وتسليم السلطة للشعب، وهذا أمر مستحيل. فهم قد حددوا خيارا واحدا، وهو التخلي عن السلطة بعد أن ترق منهم كل الدماء، أو يريقوا غالب دماء الراغبين في التغيير. أي أن المعركة الفاصلة إنما يحسمها سلاح الجنجويد، وما هو مخف. وهذا الإذلال الذي تحدثه قوات الدعم السريع للرجال، مع إهانة كرامة النساء، هو من “المناظر” التي لا بد أن تخبر كل الناس بأن لا حدود لهذه الانتهاكات. ولعل ما حدث إبان ثورة سبتمبر جزء من الرسالة التي أوصلها نظام الإخوان المسلمين للمواطنين في عاصمة البلاد.
صلع شباب الخرطوم.. الفاعل مجهول؟


نعم ان حميدتي اذا تم دورة يتم ابعادة كمآ هلال والساقية لسة مدورة والشعب يعاني

Sudan’s FM Asma Abdallah meets head of UN sanctions committee Joanna Wronecka on 13 October 2019 (SUNA photo)October 13, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The head of the UN sanctions committee on Sudan and South Sudan, Joanna Wronecka held talks with Foreign Minister Asmaa Mohamed Abdallah, focusing on the peace process in South Sudan, according to a statement released in Khartoum on Sunday.
Wronecka earlier this week informed the UN Security Council that violence continues in Darfur despite the regime change in Sudan and announced she will travel soon to Khartoum.
However, an official at the Foreign Ministry told Sudan Tribune that the international official only discussed the situation in South Sudan.
In a press statement released after the meeting, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Babikir al-Siddiq said that Joanna praised the role of the Government of Sudan in supporting the peace agreement in South Sudan and the important role played in the process.
“She also praised Sudan’s hosting of refugees from South Sudan, a matter that has had a positive impact on the protection of civilians, especially women and children.”
Sudan is subject to international sanctions by the Security Council under resolution 1591 of 2005 and established in March of the same year, a special committee to monitor the implementation of the relevant sanctions.
Because of the violence and atrocities committed against civilians in Darfur, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo for Darfur region besides targeted sanctions including a travel ban and assets freezing of officials and militia leaders involved in the conflict that has been going on for more than 16 years in the western Sudan region of Darfur.
For her part, the Sudanese Foreign Minister welcomed the UN-visiting official and stressed that Sudan and South Sudan are one people in two countries and that her country is keen to achieve peace in South Sudan.
According to the spokesman, the minister explained the political developments in Sudan following the historic change and the victory of the December Revolution which had a positive impact on the relations between Sudan and South Sudan, as he said.
“The Minister stressed that the security and stability of South Sudan is the security and stability of Sudan. Therefore Sudan is keen to support the formation of the Transitional Government of National Unity on 12 November 2019 after being postponed for six months.”
Asma further touched the challenges facing the formation of the government of national unity and the implementation of the South Sudan peace agreement. In addition, she underlined the need to provide Juba with the necessary financial resources to implement the revitalized peace agreement as it exceeds the capabilities of the fledgeling state in South Sudan.

For the first time, South Sudan with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO) has successfully conducted its first ever laboratory test for Ebola from a suspected case in Rumbek as part of emergency preparedness, WHO has reported.
For the first time, South Sudan with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO) has successfully conducted its first ever laboratory test for Ebola from a suspected case in Rumbek as part of emergency preparedness, WHO has reported.
According to WHO, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) in Rumbek on 12 of this month alerted them that one of its staff who had recently returned from DRC could be suffering from Ebola.
Both WHO and ministry of health dispatched a rapid response team which took blood samples from the patient for investigation at the National Public Health Laboratory in Juba using the GeneXpert technology with results emerging 6 hours later.
The samples have now been sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute for differential diagnosis.
Earlier this year 20 ministry of health staff from the National and State levels underwent an intensive training on laboratory biosafety and Ebola preparedness, including the use of GeneXpert to safely test for the Zaire strain of Ebola at the National Public Health Laboratory.
WHO Representative in South Sudan, Dr. Olushayo Olu said the testing of suspected Ebola cases with support of optimal laboratory capacities at national level is a critical component of national readiness capacities for Ebola response.
He commended South Sudan’s efforts and acknowledged support from donors who have strengthened the laboratory system in South Sudan while pledging continued support to establish additional capacity to diagnose other strains in the country.
Although South Sudan has not reported a confirmed case of Ebola, the South Sudan ministry of health has been on very high alert since the August Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, recently the WHO risk assessment raised the alarm from high to very high in DRC’s neighbouring countries including South Sudan.

Title: Actualités SOUDAN :: Soudan : La Commission nationale des droits de l'homme accuse les membres du Gouvernement :: SUDAN News
Le chef de la Commission nationale des droits de l’homme du Soudan (HCDH), a affirmé, samedi, que l’organisation faisait face aux violations des droits de l’homme commises par certains membres de l’équipe gouvernementale en charge de la sécurité et de l’armée. Iman Fatah al-Rahman Salem s’est exprimé plusieurs jours après une sortie des Forces d’appui rapide (RSF), réfusant toute implication de ses troupes dans une attaque contre les civiles.
Pour Iman Fatah al-Rahman Salem, Il y a eu des violations des droits de l’homme commises par certains membres des institutions en charge du respect de la loi dans le pays. Lors d’une interview accordée à l’agence nationale d’information du Soudan, le chef du HCDH affirme qu’il y a eu dans le pays des violations graves des droits de l’homme qui pourraient ternir l’image, et « saboter les efforts des institutions en charges du respect des droits comme le Ministère de l’Intérieur, la sûreté nationale et bien d’autres institutions », a-t-il ajouté. M. Salem précise que ces violations ont mis en lumière la nécessité d’une amélioration de la situation des droits de l’homme dans le pays.
Récemment, des jeunes hommes ont été attaqués par des éléments armés, présentés comme appartenant aux RSFs, dans l’Etat de Khartoum. Des activistes ont diffusé des photos et vidéos où des hommes en armes frappaient des jeunes et coupaient leurs cheveux. Mais lors d’un show télévisé le 9 octobre, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo (aka Hametti), le commandant des RSFs a accusé des circuits gouvernementaux d’avoir ciblé ses éléments.
Le chef du HCDH a souligné la nécessité d’une discussion avec les différentes agences en charge de sa sureté et du respect des lois, pour une amélioration du respect des droits de l’homme. « Ceci nécessite la mise en place d’un partenariat entre les agences en charge du respect des lois et les institutions internationales. Le but étant de former et sensibiliser aux droits de l’Homme, dans l’optique de mieux contrôler leurs personnels », a-t-il proposé.
Il est à noter que les membres de la Commission nationale des droits de l’homme ont du mal à voir leurs recommandations exécutées par le gouvernement, pourtant ils sont également nommés par le chef de l’Etat.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls on the Vietnamese authorities to stop persecuting independent journalists who give voice to the population’s demands, after a blogger was given an additional five-year jail sentence just weeks after being sentenced to four years in prison.
Do Cong Duongwill now have to serve a total of nine years after a court in Bac Ninh, on the outskirts of Hanoi, imposed the five-year sentence on 12 October on a charge of “abusing democratic freedom.” He was given thefour-year sentence on 17 Septemberon a charge of “disturbing public order.”

Duong was arrested in January for posting articles and video reports about land rights, in particular, about the evictions to which the most vulnerable sectors of the population are increasingly being subjected as a result of rapid urbanization in Vietnam.

“This double sentence constitutes outright persecution,” said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk. “By jailing Do Cong Duong, the Vietnamese authorities are depriving civil society of yet another blogger who was giving voice to the population’s demands. It is time to end this all-out offensive by the ruling party’s current leadership, which is hell-bent on silencing all independent voices.”

On the same day that Duong receiving his second sentence, RSF learned that the Hanoi police had decided to hold freelance journalistLe Anh Hungfor another two monthswhile they continue to investigate his activities.

Hung was arrested on 5 July on suspicion of “abusing democratic freedom”in connection with the analyses he publishedabout the risks to Vietnam’s sovereignty posed by aproposed law on Special Economic Zones. The unveiling of this bill and a proposed cyber-security lawset off a major outcry in June.

Vietnam has long been near the bottom ofRSF’s World Press Freedom Indexand is ranked 175th out of 180 countries in the 2018 Index.

Over a century after the original Scramble for Africa, European leaders are today imposing new forms of colonialism on the continent in the shape of militarized border controls.

Evan Clayburg

In 1891, the French economist Paul Leroy Beaulieu fiercely defended European colonialism in Africa, saying: “This state of the world implies for the civilized people a right of intervention … in the affairs of [barbarian tribes or savages].”
Beaulieu’s defense came in the midst of the European carve-up of Africa cemented in the 1885 Berlin agreement. As it has now been five decades since most African liberation movements won independence, it might therefore seem a surprise to read a European ambassador in May 2018declaringthat “Niger is now the southern border of Europe.”  Two thousand miles to the east, the ambassador’s comments were echoed by a Sudanese border patrol agent, Lieutenant Salih Omar, interviewed by theNew York Times, whoreferredto the Sudan-Eritrean border as “Europe’s southern border.”
There has long been an argument, prominently articulated by Ghanaian freedom-fighter Kwame Nkrumah, that European control of Africa’s destiny never ended with colonialism. These cogent arguments largely focused on the way debt, trade and aid have been used to structure the continued dependence of Africa’s newly independent states on Europe. The consensus, however, by both a European ambassador and a Sudanese border patrol guard that Europe’s border is not in the Mediterranean but lies as far away as Sudan and Niger, suggests that European territorial control of Africa has not really ended either.
The reason for this European re-engagement with African territory — and not just political and economic dominance — has been largely due to one factor: a desire to control migration. The rise in the number of refugees fleeing to Europe, particularly after the Syrian civil war, pushed migration high up the political agenda, releasing significant resources for border control. Europe’s Coastguard and Border Agency Frontex has seen an incredible 5,233 percent rise in funding since 2005 (from €6 million to €320 million in 2018). Borders have been militarized in Eastern Europe and border guards deployed across Europe from Calais to Lesvos.
Less well known is that it has also led the EU to put migration control at the heart of its international policies and its relations with third countries, insisting on border control agreements with more than 35 neighboring nations to control migration, labelled in Commission-speak as “border externalization”. These agreements require signatory nations to accept deported migrants from Europe, to increase border controls and staff on borders, introduce new biometric identity and passport systems to monitor migrants, as well as to build detention camps to detain refugees.
The rationale given by the EU is that this will prevent the deaths of refugees, but a more likely reason is that it wants to make sure that refugees are stopped long before they get to European shores. This satisfies both the hostile racist politicians in Europe as well as those seemingly more liberal politicians unwilling to confront whipped-up anti-immigrant sentiment, who want the crisis out of sight, out of mind. Germany, for example, with a relatively progressive record of welcoming refugees (at least in the summer of 2015), is also one of the main funders of border externalization, happily signing agreements with dictators like Sisi in Egypt to prevent refugees heading to Europe.
The evidence suggests these agreements may have served the EU’s ultimate purpose of decreasing numbers entering Europe, but it certainly has not increased refugees’ safety and security. Most studies show that it has forced refugees to seek more dangerous routes and rely on ever more unscrupulous traffickers. The proportion of recorded deaths to arrivals on Mediterranean routes to Europe in 2017 was overfive times as highin 2017 as it was in 2015. Many more deaths at sea and in deserts in North Africa are never recorded.
As anew reportby the Transnational Institute and Stop Wapenhandel reveals, it has also led the European Union to embrace authoritarian regimes — and worse, provide equipment and funding to repressive police and security forces — while diverting necessary resources from investments in health, education and jobs.
Niger, a major transit country for refugees, has become the biggest per capita recipient of EU aid in the world. This is partly because it is one of the world’s poorest countries, but it is also prioritized because it is a gateway for many refugees heading to Europe. There seem to be no limits to resources available for border infrastructure, yet the World Food Program, which supports almost a tenth of Niger’s population, has received only 34 per cent of the funding it needs for 2018. Meanwhile, under European pressure, the strengthening of border security has destroyed the migration-based economy in the Agadez region, threatening the fragile internal stability in the country.
The EU’s dependence on cooperation with the Nigerien government has also emboldened the country’s autocratic leaders. A protest against increased food prices by Nigeriens in March 2018, for example, led to the arrests of its main organizers. Refugees travelling through Niger report increased human rights abuses and are forced to take greater risks to migrate. In one horrifying case in June 2016, the bodies of 34 refugees, including 20 children, were found in the Sahara desert, apparently left to die from thirst by smugglers.
Similarly in Sudan, the European Union maintains that it upholds international sanctions on the notorious Al-Bashir regime for its war crimes and repression, yet it has not faltered in signing border control agreements with Sudanese government agencies. This has included training and equipment for border police officers, even though Sudan’s borders are patrolled primarily by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which consist of former Janjaweed militia fighters used to fight internal dissent under the operational command of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). Human Rights Watch has “found that the RSF committed a wide range of horrific abuses, including … torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes.” The German government agency GIZ says it is aware of the risks of cooperation, but nevertheless considers it “necessary” to include them in capacity development measures.
Europe’s involvement in Sudan and Niger underscores author and activist Harsha Walia’s argument in her book,Undoing Border Imperialism, that border control measures are a form of imperialism because they include displacement, criminalization, racialized hierarchies and the exploitation of people. It is noticeable in terms of historical echoes for EU border imperialism that while the Scramble for Africa was largely defended by its colonial apologists for its potential to civilize the “barbarians” at Europe’s gates, the focus this time seems to be only about keeping the “barbarians” from passing through Europe’s gates.
In even more disturbing historical parallels, it is shocking to note that while the 1885 Berlin Agreement stipulated that Africa “may not serve as a market or means of transit for the trade in slaves, of whatever race they may be,” the EU’s collaboration with Libyan militia has actually led to a revival of the slave trade, with refugees being sold as slaves captured on CNN in late 2017.
We should not ultimately be surprised. As journalist Dawn Paleyhas noted, “far from preventing violence, the border is in fact the reason it occurs.” Borders are walls that seek to block out a gross inequality between Africa and Europe constructed during colonialism and perpetuated by European economic and political policies today. Ultimately this violence is felt on the body, the border marking its scars across the flesh of people. It is felt in the torn skin of those who daily try to cross the fortified fences of Ceuta and Melilla in Morocco. It is felt in the violated bodies of women raped and abused by smugglers and border guards. It is there in the many undiscovered skeletons in North African deserts and the Mediterranean Sea.
This border imperialism is not an exclusive European phenomenon. It can be found in Mexico’sPrograma Frontera Sur,started in 2014 under pressure from the United States, to strengthen border security on its border with Guatemala. Like its European equivalents, it has also resulted in more repression and violence against refugees, increased detention and deportations and the forcing of refugees towards more dangerous migration routes and into the hands of criminal smuggle networks.
Perhaps the most well-known example of border externalization are Australia’s offshore detention centers on the islands of Nauru and, until ruled illegal last year, in Manus (Papua New Guinea). All migrants trying to go to Australia by sea are transported to these centers, which are run by private contractors, and kept there for long periods. If the detained refugees are granted asylum status, they are resettled in third countries. This policy is accompanied by “Operation Sovereign Borders”, a military maritime operation to force or tow refugee boats back to international waters.
There have been many cases of human rights violations in Australia’s offshore detention centers. Yet many European leaders have embraced the Australian model, increasingly arguing for the EU to put refugees in “processing camps” in North African countries, building on the current policy of turning Europe’s neighbors into its new border guards. Europe enthusiastically embraces the Australian approach of building camps in remote places, which, as human rights lawyer Daniel Webb notes, serve “to hide from view what they don’t want the public to see — deliberate cruelty to innocent human beings.”

While the similarities between these examples of border externalization are undeniable, only in Europe do they explicitly connect the policies to old colonial relations. At the launch of the Partnership Framework on Migration, the overall framework for cooperation on migration with third countries, in June 2016, the European Commission noted that “the special relationships that member states may have with third countries, reflecting political, historic and cultural ties fostered through decades of contacts, should also be exploited to the full for the benefit of the EU.” It also unequivocally praised the opportunity the agreement provided for European business, arguing that “private investors looking for new investment opportunities in emerging markets” must play a much greater role instead of “traditional development co-operation models.”
This points us towards the private interests benefiting from these border externalization policies: the military and security industries providing the equipment and services to implement strengthened and militarized border security and control in third countries. A plethora of firms have thrived in this expanding market, but prominent among them are European arms giants such as Airbus (Paneuropean), Thales (France) and Leonardo (Italy — formerly named Finmeccanica).
These are not just the casual winners of EU policies; they are also the driving forces behind them. They have both set the general discourse — framing migration as a security threat, to be combated by military means — as well as put forward concrete proposals, such as the creation of the EU surveillance “system of systems” EUROSUR and the expansion of Frontex, which through successful lobbying have been turned into official EU policies and new institutions.
These firms then can reap the rewards by promoting their own services and products, helped along by their constant interaction with EU policymakers. This encompasses regular meetings with officials at the European Commission and Frontex, participation in official advisory bodies, the issuing of influential advisory papers, participation in security fairs and conferences, and more. While the main focus has been on militarizing the EU external borders, companies increasingly eye the African border security market as well. Hence they are also lobbying for EU funding for border security purchases of third countries.
This strategy has paid off handsomely. Strengthening the global competitiveness of the European military and security industry has now become a stated objective of the EU. The Commission plans for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the EU budget for 2021-2027, propose to almost triple spending on migration control. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, EU member states and third countries will all get more money to spend on strengthening border security, including the purchase of military and security equipment and services.
While specific horrific situations, such as the migrant slave markets in Libya or a particular drowning incident in the Mediterranean, sometimes cause outrage and opposition, it is hard to see a change in the general European emphasis on “bringing down the numbers” of people willing to make the crossing. This is even more challenging when EU border militarization is outsourced to and hence rendered largely invisible in countries far from Europe.
EU policies need to be fought at a number of levels, both inside the EU and in third countries. This means that we do not only need to act against the most obvious manifestations of these policies — in terms of border control and the detention and deportations of refugees — but also against the private interests behind these policies. We have to unmask the commercial, industrial forces that are currently profiting from Europe’s border imperialism, as well as the media outlets and political parties that have manipulated public opinion by targeting refugees as scapegoats for the consequences of austerity policies.
More systemically, confronting border colonialism requires addressing Western responsibility at large, eliminating the reasons people are forced to flee in the first place, and resisting those policies and stakeholders in Western countries that are causing them: EU support for authoritarian rulers, the companies causing climate change, unjust trade relations, corporate impunity, reckless military interventions and the arms trade. And it means true decolonization, ending the continued European grip on its former colonies, and working towards a fundamental shift in the international order. This will become even more important in the context of worsening climate change, when migration, even if largely internal, will be a necessary form of adaptation.It will also require increased solidarity and cooperation with movements and organizations in the third countries affected, in horizontal forms of collaboration. This could include support for migrant-led movements emerging in many countries, for communities that host large numbers of (stranded) refugees, direct humanitarian efforts such as the search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean, as well as for organizations advocating for human rights for migrants. But it could also include groups and movements fighting for democratization, against authoritarian regimes, against extractive industries, and those seeking a livelihood for everyone, against violence and Western domination.
Unravelling the legacy of colonialist violence will not be easy. While the European Union is divided on many issues, the consensus around border security is strong. The great decolonial thinker Frantz Fanon realized how colonialism colonized not just territory and the body but also the mind. As he wrote inBlack Skin, White Masks:
In order to terminate this neurotic situation, in which I am compelled to choose an unhealthy, conflictual solution, fed on fantasies, hostile, inhuman in short, I have only one solution: to rise above this absurd drama that others have staged around me, to reject the two terms that are equally unacceptable, and through one human being, to reach out for the universal.
It is a yearning for a universal humanity reflected in slogans that “no human is illegal” — the only true basis for an end to the violence of border imperialism.

Title: Denuncian el deterioro de la seguridad para los periodistas en Europa tras sendos asesinatos | Heraldo.es
En lo que va de año, 56 periodistas han sido asesinados y 155 están en prisión por tratar de hacer su trabajo.
La sección española de Reporteros sin Fronteras (RSF) ha denunciado hoy "el deterioro rapidísimo de la seguridad para los periodistas en suelo europeo" y ha condenado losasesinatosde los informadores Victoria Marinova enBulgariay Jamal Khashoggi enEstambul.
"La espantosa muerte de la periodista de investigación búlgara Viktoria Marinova y el asesinato del periodista disidente saudí Jamal Kashogui en el consulado de su país en Estambul, -que parece confirmarse a cada minuto que pasa-, señalan eldeterioro rapidísimo de la seguridad para los periodistas en suelo europeo", ha indicado en declaraciones a Efe el presidente de RSF España, Alfonso Armada.
El pasado sábado, Marinova fue brutalmente asesinada. La informadora búlgara, directora y presentadora de latelevisiónregional privada TVN era laresponsable de un reportaje de investigación sobre apropiación indebida de fondos europeos.
Desde RSF recuerdan que los periodistas de investigación búlgaros suelen sufrir todo tipo de presiones quevan desde advertencias hasta asaltos o palizas.
Por su parte, el presidente de la asociación de prensa turco-árabe, Turan Kislakçi, aseguraba ayer que "está confirmado" queel periodista saudí Jamal Khashoggi -desaparecido desde el pasado martes- fue asesinadoen el consulado de su país en Estambul.
Reporteros sin Fronteras ha lamentado que "los asesinatos de los últimos díasmarcan una semana especialmente trágica para la libertad de informaciónenEuropa" y ha insistido en que lleva años constatando el deterioro de la seguridad para los informadores en este continente.
La organización ha exigido que se realice una investigación completa de ambos asesinatos que permita llevar a los perpetradores ante la justicia, así como quese extremen las medidas de seguridad para proteger a los periodistas en riesgo.
"La impunidad no puede instalarse también en el espacio europeo. Estos crímenes execrables -como también lo fueron el de Daphne Caruana Galizia enMaltay el de Jan Kuciak enEslovaquia-,ocurridos en menos de un año y en territorio europeo, no pueden salir gratis a quienes desean callar a los periodistas incómodos", ha subrayado Armada.

Title: The Sentry Report, War Crimes: Isn't it time for immunities and restarting South Sudan afresh? - Sudan Tribune

Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
By Roger Alfred Yoron Modi
Last month, The Sentry Report released a report titled “The Taking of South Sudan- the Tycoons, Brokers, and Multinational Corporations Complicit in Hijacking the World’s Newest Nation.”
The report argues that The Sentry’s investigation exposes an array of international actors who stand to profit from the U.S., UK, Asia and elsewhere, the looting of state assets, and reveals one of the biggest companies in the world providing direct support to deadly militias.
“Our report details the carving up for the private profit of the most lucrative economic and government sectors in the world’s youngest nation. Meanwhile, the South Sudanese people starved were killed, and were run off their homelands,” it added.
“The men who liberated South Sudan proceeded to hijack the country’s fledgeling governing institutions, loot its resources, and launched a war in 2013 that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people.
“They did not act alone. The South Sudanese politicians and military officials ravaging the world’s newest nation received essential support from individuals and corporations from across the world who have reaped profits from those dealings. Nearly every instance of confirmed or alleged corruption or financial crime in South Sudan examined by The Sentry has involved links to an international corporation, a multinational bank, a foreign government or high-end real estate abroad. This report examines several illustrative examples of international actors linked to violence and grand corruption in order to demonstrate the extent to which external actors have been complicit in the taking of South Sudan.”
The report says, the “local kleptocrats” and their international partners—from Chinese-Malaysian oil giants and British tycoons to networks of traders from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda—have accumulated billions of dollars.
The report alleges that President Salva Kiir’s global corporate network includes Members of his immediate family as shareholders and directors in companies alongside dozens of foreign nations from 13 different countries
A multinational oil consortium in South Sudan controlled by China National Petroleum Corporation and Malaysia’s state-owned oil company, Petronas, offered material support to a pro-government Padang militia that committed gross human rights violations in Melut, Malakal and Renk, the report says.
It further states that some of the South Sudanese worked with the companies, including the former minister of petroleum Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth and General Malek Reuben:
“Dar Petroleum agreed to pay $686,056 to Crown Hotel in Juba to cover bills racked up by then-Minister of Petroleum Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth—a dual US-South Sudan citizen— at a rate of $30,000 to $59,000 per month,” added the report.
Other records indicate that funds earmarked for community development were diverted to Dar Petroleum to finance oil production, purchase armoured vehicles and pay for the college tuition of the son of Malek Reuben Riak, according to the report.
In September 2016 also, The Sentry released another report on alleged corruption in South Sudan.
The report says leaders, including President Kiir, SPLA Chief of General Staff Paul Malong and former first Vice-President Dr Riek Machar “appear to have accumulated significant wealth since 2005.”
“Much of the wealth that has been accumulated by these top leaders is in the form of high-end properties outside the country and extensive commercial holdings in both public sector and oil services contracting in South Sudan,” the Sentry said.
However, there is one key similarity about both reports: the timing. At the time of releasing the first Sentry report in September 2016, Igad and the international community were making progress in restoring peace and moving forward with the ARCSS implementation as could be seen from the then-latest communique of the second IGAD-plus extraordinary summit on the situation in the Republic of South Sudan which resolved that, they “Encourages Dr Riek Machar to rejoin the peace process and for President Salva Kiir Mayardit and the people of South Sudan to embrace a return to the spirit of long-lasting peace in their country. In this regard, welcomes the gesture of General Taban Deng Ghai to step down with a view of returning to the status quo ante in line with the ARCSS for the sake of peace and stability in the Republic of South Sudan.” The timing of that Sentry report had a negative impact on the peace efforts that was going on.
Now again, the release of the last month’s Sentry report cannot be argued to be by accident since the Country is almost moving towards the formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity scheduled for November with the aim of restoring peace and implementing the R-ARCSS as others who want peace continue to urge for dialogue with the non-signatories of the R-ARCSS. Did The Sentry have all the information all this time and still waited for this moment to release them? Why? Are those the only information they have on alleged corruption in South Sudan or they are just specifically targeting certain individuals with the aim of prolonging the war? It is well known that corruption in South Sudan is huge and wide. However, the solution will be to go back to where and how it all started.
No doubt, we South Sudanese started on the wrong foot. In terms of institutions for justice (including for historical injustices), anti-corruption, reconciliation healing and nation-building, almost everything was wrong. Even our friends in the region and the world community turned a blind eye when our leaders were starting wrong despite outcries from other peaceful oppositions at the time. Was it by design in order to get South Sudan into the current mess and deadlocks?
Immunities and restarting South Sudan afresh the way forward to lasting peace?
It is important to distinguish between war talks during war times and peace talks during peace processes. When the war in South Sudan was raging, several of the rebels (opposition) groups used to say President Kiir lost his legitimacy and that his regime is genocidal, ethnocentric, etc. Similarly, the government used to call many of the rebels (opposition groups) terrorists, bandits, etc. But all these dramatically changed when there was progress in the peace talks and since the R-ARCSS was signed.
When the SPLA/M under Dr John Garang de Mabior was fighting the successive Khartoum based governments, he would tell the SPLA soldiers in a rally (ies) that the SPLA/M was never going to sign an agreement with the government in Khartoum that would make them share power. He would insist that the SPLA/M was a government by itself that would simply replace/overthrow the government in Khartoum and take overpower. But what happened later? In 2005, the SPLA/M signed a power-sharing agreement with Al-Bashir’s government known as the Comprehensive Peace Agreement CPA which later gave birth to the Republic of South Sudan through several of its provisions have not been implemented.
In his famous speech at a rally in Rumbek after the signing of the CPA, Dr Garang declared,“Achin Akuma tok, ajama Akuma ta John Garang wa Akuma ta Bashir biga wahid”which translates to “the government is now one, the government of John Garang and the government of Bashir are now one” contrary to his promise to the SPLA/M (dead and alive) that the SPLA/M was a government by itself and would not share power with any government in Khartoum.
The key lessons we can learn from both scenarios are that war languages during war times and peace languages during peace processes are different things altogether.
Also, though the CPA guaranteed, among others, the right of self-determination to the people of Southern Sudan and a Referendum to the people of Abyei and Popular Consultation to the People of South Kordofan and Blue Nile state, the CPA did not provide accountability for the gross abuses and war crimes committed from 1983 to 2005 in which an estimated two million died and four million were forcibly displaced, including the Bor Massacre and the 1992 Juba Massacre, etc. The CPA also did not make provision for prosecuting against corruption committed during that period.
In 2011, South Sudan’s Independence Constitution (the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan) provides that all levels of government shall initiate a comprehensive process of national reconciliation and healing that shall promote national harmony, unity and peaceful co-existence among the people of South Sudan. Though a Commission was formed for that purpose, it has not achieved the objectives so far and that has a direct impact on the war which started in 2013 in the Country since several people and communities remain unreconciled and unhealed.
Today, Human Rights Watch said South Sudan’s government and the African Union should urgently meet to clarify plans to set up a proposed hybrid court for wartime atrocities in a letter to both the government and the AU.
In June 2017 I wrote an article for African Arguments arguing that the military trials of South Sudan Soldiers’ accused of raping foreign aid workers and killing a local colleague is a publicity stunt and distraction since those alleged crimes ought to have been tried under the Hybrid Court per the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan ARCSS.
I wrote:
“The fact that these government troops are being tried may appear to be a positive development amidst the country’s devastating conflict, lack of accountability, and dire humanitarian situation. It will be for the victims if justice is served.
However, in terms of tackling impunity in South Sudan more broadly, the trial is sadly little more than a publicity stunt – and one that could even forestall wider justice in the country.” Over two years later, I am still right as I was then.
But the big question is would partial justice to crimes committed from 2013 reconcile and heal the nation? What about those committed during the last liberation war as indicated above?
Furthermore, will the Hybrid Court have enough evidence to prosecute all or most of the major crimes? If not, what shall be the impact on national reconciliation and healing in the Country?
According to ARCSS, the South Sudanese parties agreed that a Hybrid Court would be established by the African Union Commission, to investigate and prosecute crimes committed from 15 December 2013 through to the end of the Transitional Period, which concluded in 2018. The Court, per the Agreement, would include personnel from both South Sudan and abroad, and it would have jurisdiction over allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations including gender-based and sexual violence.
Despite the fact that that Transitional Period ended, the Hybrid Court has yet to be established.
As of 2017, according to the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, established by the UN Human Rights Council, these delays mean that “valuable time was lost, and possibly, important evidence of major war crimes and human rights abuses.”
Now the September 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan R-ARCSS provides that Hybrid Court for South Sudan (HCSS) shall be established by the African Union Commission “to investigate and where necessary” prosecute individuals bearing responsibility for violations of international law and/or applicable South Sudanese law, committed from 15th December 2013 through the end of the Transitional Period.
Though the terms “where necessary” are new and were not there in the original ARCSS, it is also not mentioned who or which body shall determine that necessity prosecute.
If the parties to the R-ARCSS find it appropriate, they can collectively agree that it is no longer necessary to prosecute “individuals bearing responsibility for violations of international law and/or applicable South Sudanese law, committed from 15th December 2013 through the end of the Transitional Period. Legally speaking, the R-ARCSS provision on the Hybrid Court is not like that of the 2015 ARCSS and the parties have options to substitute trials/prosecutions with truth, reconciliation, healing and reparations for all the gross abuses and war crimes going before December 2013. Isn’t that how best South Sudan could be healed and reconciled?
The same with corruption allegations like those included in The Sentry. Will selective or partial prosecution of corrupt individuals and corporation lead to justice and peace? If it can be done at the external levels, outside South Sudan, well and good. However, in South Sudan, there are no strong institutions to deliver justice. The anti-corruption commission and the Judiciary are still under the direct influence and control of the executive and the president.  That is why the R-ARCSS provides for their reforms and making them independent and powerful. When the Colonialists were leaving, the legal order established was that the law does not apply retroactively and they went away with their sins. And so wouldn’t a start with immunities for all the crimes (current and historical) be the best option for peace and reconciliation and establishing a new South Sudan? So that we make reforms and laws that apply forward and not backwards? Isn’t that how we could protect the peace agreement and include its non-signatories and move our country forward and maintain regional peace?
One important thing is to incorporate the R-ARCSS into the transitional Constitution for that is where the next Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity RTGoNU shall gain legitimacy from. You cannot swear in the RTGoNU using a Constitution that has not incorporated the very R-ARCSS.
The fear of the Hybrid Court against the incorporation of the R-ARCSS is an error since it is now provided that the prosecution shall be done “where necessary.”
Forming a government without incorporating the R-ARCSS into the Transitional Constitution is not only a road towards being illegitimate but also a receipt for collapse or being challenged legally. It is worth mentioning that despite the flaws with the CPA, Dr Garang ensured that before assuming power, the CPA was incorporated in both the Interim Constitution of the Republic of Sudan and the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan. That was what majorly let to the success that came including the Independence of South Sudan.
In an article in February 2017, I argued that the National Dialogue initiated by President Kiir is not consistent with the then peace agreement (ARCSS) due to technicalities of the Articles he cited while forming the responsible committee and the non-inclusion of many opposition groups in the process.
Now even, it is not anymore the ARCSS but the R-ARCSS and more or less different circumstances. Given the general momentum for peace, if all or most of the parties, including the opposition, could agree to join the National Dialogue and use it to complement, not undo, the R-ARCSS, well and good, especially in the area on reconciling and healing the Country.
The options for true peace, reconciliation, healing and starting a new, reformed and federal republic in South Sudan is still on the table. Do not let it slip away just because some are under the pay of war profiteers.

Gov’t and SPLM-N al-Hilu delegations meet in Juba on 19 Oct 2019 (Sovereign Council photo)October 21, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – The National Umma Party (NUP) led by Sadiq al-Mahdi, on Monday welcomed Qatar’s readiness to support the Sudanese government’s efforts to achieve peace during the transitional period.
In a recent visit to Khartoum earlier this month, Mutlaq al-Qahtani Qatar’s Special Envoy for Conflict Resolutions announced his country readiness to support Sudan and to use its regional and international relations to achieve peace, stability and development.
Further, in a meeting with the Sudanese Foreign Minister on Sunday, Qatari Ambassador to Khartoum Abdul Rahman Al-Kubaisi reaffirmed his country’s desire to enhance cooperation with Sudan in all fields, especially investment.
“The National Umma Party welcomes this expected position from the brothers in Qatar,” said a statement released on Monday evening.
“The party renews its call and appeal to brothers and friends to support the transitional period and provide assistance to peace processes and democratic transition,” further said the statement.
The NUP is one of the major groups of the Forces for Freedom and Change that back Hamdok’s government. Also, it is part of the Sudan Call alliance which gathers the NUP, the armed groups under the banner of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front and the Sudanese Congress Party.
In line with the Juba Declaration between the Sudanese government and the Sudanese Revolutionary Front, the South Sudanese mediation was requested to invite Qatar as well as Saudi Arabia and the UAE to sponsor the peace process.
The statement comes as the Friend of Sudan Group, including Qatar, met Monday in Washington to discuss ways to support the Sudanese transitional government which faces tough economic challenges.
Previously Qatar had a mandate from the African Union and the United Nations with the UNAMID head to broker the Darfur peace process.
The gas-rich country allocated 177 million for rehabilitation and development projects in the war-affected region besides the building of 15 model villages in Darfur.
