Title: Darfur disarmament: Local leaders fear more war than peace | Nuba Reports
Journalists are banned from the Nuba mountains. This makes it extremely difficult for International media to cover the war and it’s impact on civilians. Nuba Reports brings together local journalists with professional editors and mentors in order to produce verifiable and compelling dispatches from the front lines.But for the model to work, we need your help. Make this hidden conflict visible.Make it news.
Fighting broke out in June 2011 between Sudan’s government and Nuban rebels. Nuba Reports was founded by people living in the region after journalists and NGOs were banned. Our goal is to provide Sudan and the International community with credible and compelling dispatches from the front lines of this conflict and to illuminate the war’s impact on civilians.more
Darfur tribal leaders fear the recent government-led disarmament exercise in the region may lead to further conflict than peace. While the local representatives support the idea of disarmament, they believe the implementation procedures and the armed group assigned to conduct the task may incur further regional strife.
“The citizen [of Darfur] carry weapons because he does not feel safe,” explains Masalit leader, Sultan Malik Yacoub. The hurried disarmament campaign lacks consultation with local communities and targets certain groups over others, Yacoub said. “We will only face more chaos this way.”
In late July, Sudan’s Vice-President Hasabo Abel Rahmanannouncedthe launch of the disarmament campaign in the Darfur and Kordofan areas, along with the re-organisation of state-allied militias in the region. According to a presidential decree, illegal weapons and vehicles are to be handed over voluntarily to the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) or local authorities. Following the voluntary submissions, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Ouf said they would collect arms from residents by force. Finally, various government militias recruited to fight the insurgency in Darfur are meant to merge into the RSF, an orderopposedby the formerly pro-government Border Guard militia.
Both the president and deputy have cited in speeches that the free flow of illegal arms among Darfur citizenry as the “biggestthreatto Darfur’s security” and that disarmament was the government’s “toppriority”.
Darfur “a market for arms”
The need to curb the expansive arm trade in Darfur is palpable to all citizenry in the region. Over the past decade, more than 730 tribalclashestook place in Darfur leading to mass killings and displacement. Some 277 civilians havediedin Darfur this year alone.
According to former South Darfur State official Hussein Mousi, the government started to distribute weapons to certain tribes in Darfur to quell the rebel insurgency in 2003 and continued doing so to present day, particularly in East and South Darfur states. For the past ten years the government is the single largest supplier of weapons in the region, Mousi toldNuba Reports. With arms via the government as well as flowing from neighbouring countries, “Darfur has turned into a market for arms,” he said.

So far, the disarmament programme has met little success due to the fears of insecurity by citizens, local tribal leaders claim. By August 21, no more than 179 weapons were collected in South Darfur despite a local inventory estimating around 17,000 arms within the state, news reportssaid. The lack of progress led Vice President Abdel Rahman a week later toannounceduring a forum a “shoot to kill” policy for those who resisted the disarmament campaign.
According to theDarfur Relief and Rehabilitation Centre, a civil society-based advocacy organisation, dozens of community leaders were arrested for refusing to cooperate in the disarmament campaign. Fulani tribal leader Abdullah Arshu spoke toNuba Reportsvia prison. Arshu was detained earlier this year for his protests against violations by RSF forces against civilians in the region. “People need to protect themselves from insecurity, it is difficult [for the government] to collect arms in this environment.” Arshu believes the only way to disarm Darfur is by disarming everyone without exception, not focusing on certain tribes.
Mohamed Al Haj, a community leader from the ArabicMaaliyatribe, agrees. “The government should collect weapons from all sectors of society in Darfur, not target one tribe without the other.” Al Haj toldNuba Reportsthat authorities havearrestedArabic tribal leaders in East Darfur. “The government jails tribal leaders and then somehow requests to collect arms from individuals within the same tribe. This is not reasonable.” He added that by not collaborating with tribal leaders andrushingthe disarmament campaign, authorities “will inevitably fail.” Al Haj and other tribal leaders do not believe theinfamousRSF militia assigned to disarm civilians are neutral enough to carry out the exercise. “The majority of Rapid Support Forces are members of the Riziegat tribe,” he said. “There must be a joint force of all ethnicities to participate in the campaign.”
“The government should collect weapons from all sectors of society in Darfur, not target one tribe without the other”
–Mohamed Al Haj, Maaliya Community Leader
Opposition rebel leaders have alsocriticizedthe campaign, claiming that the pro-government militias such as the RSF must be disarmedfirstbefore leaving civilians defenceless.
But Interior Minister official Babeker Abu Samra said in August during a seminar on disarmament in Khartoum that tribal leaders should not fear and cooperate with the campaign. The police chief claimed police would be deployed across Darfur to provide protection to civilians as their arms are collected.
A notorious militia
The RSF, however, have a long track record of defying the police. In July, the RSF actuallyraideda police station in South Darfur’s capital city Nyala, forcing the police to evacuate the station after the RSF leader, Lt.-Gen. Mohamed Hamden Daglo (known at “Hemetti”) had allegedly purchased the land where the station was based. With a history of criminality, the pro-government militia are reportedly misusing their authority in the disarmament exercise in several villages in South Darfur State to steal money and other valuables, including stripping women naked in search of jewellery, the Centrereported.
RSF in Nyala, South Darfur (Nuba Reports)
The RSF’s central role in the disarmament campaign may be the key reason local Darfur communities are hesitant to support the effort and fear future conflict. According to data collected from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), the RSF may have terrorised citizenry far more than during the nadir years of the Darfur conflict when the government armed the RSF predecessor, the Janjaweed militia. The militia is known for a number of human rightsabusesagainst civilians in Darfur that triggered the International Criminal Court arrestwarrantfor President Omar Bashir in 2009. But Bashirre-brandedthe Janjaweed in 2014 under a new name, the Rapid Support Force –allegedly as a more organised and loyal paramilitary force than theirnotoriousforerunner. The Janjaweed attacked an estimated 1,000 and displaced 1.4 million civilians over a nine-year period from 2003 when the Darfur conflict began to 2012, according to ACLED research. But the RSF attacked 2,000 citizens over a two-year period from 2014 –doubling attacks against the public over a shorter timeframe. From 2013, the RSF actually displaced another 700,000 people, averaging around 20k more displaced per year under the RSF than the Janjaweed.
Signs of war
It is with this egregious record that Darfur citizens fear submitting arms to the RSF and local armed groups fear a military takeover. The former Janjaweed and Al-Mahameed tribal leader Musa Hilal is particularly concerned. If disarmed, Hametti’s RSF could takeover his forces, even his tribal leadership. This is the key reason why Hilal categoricallyrefusedthis month to integrate his Border Guard Force militia, an armed group of 3,000 Al-Mahameed tribesmen, into the RSF militia as stipulated by the government disarmament campaign.
On August 12, Hilal held a rally in his stronghold Misteriha, North Darfur State with thousands of supporters -–including traditional leaders and Border Guard Force commanders– and announced his readiness to confront the government army head on, local journalists said. A day earlier, Sudanese authoritiesarrestedseven followers of Hilal on the Darfur-Libya border, accusing them of working with a rival Libyan rebel force. To intimidate further, the Sudanese army conducted the largest internal manoeuvre in its history near the strongholds of Musa Hilal this month with the participation of tanks and the air force.
The government is under international pressure to collect weapons. UN Security Council resolution 1556 calls for disarming and dismantling the Janjaweed militia and bringing their leaders to justice. Sudan is keen to fulfil this resolution and demonstrate cooperation with the international community in hopes the U.S. willlifteconomic trade sanctions in October.
“The collection of weapons is a plan by the state to provoke a new crisis in Darfur”
–Musa Hilal, Al-Mahameed tribal leader
But Khartoum is also interested in mitigating their supporters-turned-antagonists and the disarmament campaign provides a useful tool to do so. Hilal’s forces believe the state-led weapons collection campaign is exactly that – a means to weaken them. “The collection of weapons is a plan [designed] by the state to provoke a new crisis in Darfur,” Hilal said during the rally in Misteriha.
Academic researcher Ahmed Hussein Adam concurs. A research associate at the University of London, Adam refers to the government’s disarmament campaign as “political fraud” –designed to trigger internal fighting between Darfur militias rather than remove the tools of violence in the region. Adam says Sudan’s weapon collection in Darfur is a divide-and-conquer tactic, igniting sedition to rid the government of militias after exhausting their purposes.
UNAMID troops in Darfur (UNAMID)
Whether Khartoum’s expressed intentions or not, it is clear the main victims of the government’s weapon collection in Darfur are the citizens themselves. On June 29, the UN Security Council voted toreducethe UN-AU Hybrid peacekeeping force in Darfur, UNAMID, by over a third of its troops and police officers. The resolution also called for the eventual closure of 18 team sites. A selective disarmament process that targets citizens and a reduced international presence will undoubtedly leave Darfur’s internally displaced –who represent nearly athirdof the Darfur’s population– the most vulnerable.

Ezzeldin Sambala, the spokesman for the SLM-AW strongly condemned the attack. “This incident again confirms the extent of the involvement of the regime and its militias in brutal crimes against our defenceless people,” he told this station.
He claimed that the “many militiamen in the region are still fully armed”, and called thedisarmament campaign in Darfur“one big lie”.

Title: Civilians: ‘RSF out of Sudan’s Kassala’ - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The residents and leaders of Sudan’s eastern Kassala state have renewed their demand for the withdrawal of the government’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia from the towns and villages of Kassal.
The residents and leaders of Sudan’s eastern Kassala state have renewed their demand for the withdrawal of the government’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia from the towns and villages of Kassala.
The civil appeal demands that the RSF militiamen return to their bases.
The renewed demand comes as RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemeti', arrived in Kassala on a visit to inspect his forces in the state on Thursday.
Abdallah Mousa, a senior civilian leader in eastern Sudan told Radio Dabanga: “Since its deployment in Kassala state more than three months ago, the RSF have carried out killings and attacks against the residents". He added that “they have turned into a real nightmare provoking panic and fear in the state by harassing the residents inside the districts of the state on the pretext of commodity smuggling.”
He warned of the negative impact of the militia on the social fabric in eastern Sudan, pointing to the relative stability of the eastern states.
Mousa played down to Radio Dabanga the importance of the allegation that the RSF is deployed to combat commodity smuggling and human trafficking, pointing out that the government has special anti-smuggling forces that carry out its work professionally, while the RSF continue to harass residents while transporting goods for consumption home.
He ridiculed the reasons given by the government for the deployment of the rapid support militias in Kassala state in anticipation of an Egyptian attack on Sudan from Eritrean territory.
He said that recent developments in the Sudanese-Egyptian relations and thevisit of Al Bashir to Cairoproved that this information was incorrect.
He said that the government aimed to spread these rumours and deploy the RSF troops to the state to cover up the economic crisis and an attempt to besiege the escalating popular protests.
Meeting
On Thursday the RSF commander welcomed the leaders of the native administration in Kassala, a and group of people of eastern Sudan joining the militia.
Hemeti stressed that the continued deployment of the RSF in eastern Sudan will be subject to the success of the experiment to be a nucleus in the region.

Title: EU migration deal emboldens war criminals in Sudan
TheEmergency Trust Fund for Africa, which the European Commission established in 2015, first allocated Khartoum 40 million euros to help "manage migration" in the horn of Africa. The next year, the EU agreed to give 100 million euros to aid some of the most conflict-ridden areas in the country.
Despite the rosy rhetoric, 5 million euros from the first pot of money risks going to Sudanese security agencies that are notorious for committing grave human rights abuses, according to areportby the Enough Project, a non-profit based in Washington DC.
Of most concern is the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which has its roots in the Janjaweed, meaning Devils on Horsebacks - which istaskedwith patrolling Sudan's frontiers. That same unit is responsible forkillingmore than 300,000 people, and uprooting millions in the western province of Darfur since 2003.
The EU has repeatedlydeniedfunding the group, though the head of the RSF, Mohammad Hamdan saysotherwise.Ifdocuments leakedin May 2016 to German dailySpiegelonline are to be believed, the EU planned to provide Sudan with surveillance equipment, assistance in building two migrant detention centres and training for its border patrol units.
Under these terms, the EU/Sudan partnership risks emboldening the RSF and other security branches, all of whom are tasked with cracking down on refugees or Sudanese nationals.
Human rights - an afterthought
Rocket propelled grenades, anti-aircraft missiles, and machine guns are all part of theRSF's arsenal. These are the same weapons that the group used tocrush rebellionsin South Kordofon, Darfur and the Nuba Mountains. Now, the RSF is using them to go after traffickers, smugglers and migrants.
In September 2017, the unit boasted aboutkilling 28 smugglers, but nobody knows how many civilians died in the clashes as the RSF refuses to disclose the number of migrants it kills.
Though the lack of transparency raises concerns among rights groups, it hasn't dissuaded Hamdan from attempting to blackmail the EU. According to Sudanesemedia reports, Hamdanthreatenedto stop patrolling Sudan's frontiers unless the EU pays a ransom to retrieve traffickers from RSF custody. That claim hasn't been substantiated, though it'sclearthat RSF is lobbying for more EU support.
Europe might have anticipated this trap if it wasn't blindly pursuing a clampdown on migration. The bloc's sole condition is to achieve this end without tarnishing its reputation by cooperating with the RSF.
But by dealing with a militia state, the EU is now at the mercy of war lords who run the country.
Refugees, of course, are the ones who suffer from this arrangement most. In February 2017, Khartoum's court police seized, whipped, and deported65 asylum seekers, most of whom were escaping military conscription and repression in Eritrea.Read more: State oil money is funding South Sudan conflict: Reports
Deporting people back to a country where they face a well-founded threat of persecution violates the rule ofnon-refoulment, which is the cornerstone of international law pertaining to the protection of refugees.The EU, for its part, is implicated in violating this code by supporting security forces that deport asylum seekers.
European officials have nonetheless double downed on their rhetoric, claiming that most of its financial support is channelled to partnered NGOs on the ground in Sudan. Little did they mention that some of these NGOs could be colluding with repressive state security units.
The UN Refugee agency, which is one of the EU's key partners, has even providedmotorbikesin the town of Kassala to the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) – a Sudanese spy agency whichhunts, tortures, and kills human rights defenders in the country, and in exile.
The same agency regularlycommits crimessuch as extrajudicial killings, torture and rape. It also enforces restrictions on freedom of assembly and freedom of speech throughout the country.
Most Sudanese refugees I have spoken to say they fear the NISS more than any other security agency in Sudan.
Aiding corruption
The NISS is also implicated in the trafficking and smuggling of refugees. Eritreans, Somalians and Ethiopians are crowded into warehouses in a small town outside of Kassala, where they wait to be smuggled into Khartoum by NISS agents.
A former police officer and smuggler,toldRefugees Deeply that nobody can ship persons in and out of Sudan without permission from the authorities.
With the country entrenched in corruption, the EU partnership with Sudan appears to be doing little to stop human trafficking or smuggling. Instead, law enforcement agencies appear to be profiteering from cooperating with the EU, and NGOs that the EU is supporting.
To save face, Europe would be better off annulling all agreements with countries that are headed by war criminals, starting with Sudan.The president, Omar Al-Bashir, is still wanted by the International Criminal Court for authorising crimes against humanity more than 10 years ago in Darfur. The security services under his command are notorious for crushing rebellions, killing civilians and profiteering from the chaos.
Collaborating with these security branches, under any capacity, won't remedy the causes of migration; it will exacerbate them. The EU should instead consider taking a more active role in brokering an end to protracted conflicts, while fostering sustainable economic alternatives for communities that rely on smuggling to make ends meet.
These strategies won't mitigate the migration crisis overnight, especially if regular legal channels aren't established for people to migrate safely.People from the global South will keep coming to Europe whether politicians like it or not.

Title: South Sudan's SSOA cannot be chaired by UN blacklisted leader : Changson - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
December 3, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) cannot be headed by a man blacklisted by the United Nations, said a statement attributed to Gabriel Changson faction on Sunday.
Gabriel Changson Chang (ST)Following the contested election of Peter Gadet Yaka at the head of the SSOA on Friday 30 November, the opposition umbrella is now divided into two factions as the former chairman Changson refuses to accept the result of the vote.
Peter Gatdet’s supporters point out that the term of the chairperson is limited to six months and for one unrenewable mandate. Also, the underline that he won with the support of a majority five of eight votes.
But Chanson in a statement extended to Sudan Tribune on Sudan warned again against Gatdet’s election pointing that he is under UN individual sanctions decided by the Security Council in July 2015.
“SSOA Leadership should not challenge the International Community by nominating a UN Indicted person to lead SSOA and at the same time, we criticize TGONU for doing the same. We should stick to our principles of calling spade a spade,” says a statement with the headed paper of SSOA-US.
Reached by Sudan Tribune on Monday morning, Changson confirmed its content.
His statement mentioned some procedural infractions such as the absence of election regulations in the SSOA, the quality of those who participated in the election saying four unaccredited Representatives participated in the meeting of the Leadership Council that elected Peter Gatdet.
However, he added that the real motivations for the coup can be attributed to their some differences in the Leadership Council particularly that some leaders disapproved a visit of SSOA delegation to Juba for Peace Celebration and their stay for some weeks. Also, the same leaders do not want the implementation mechanisms and institutions of R-ARCSS to conduct their meetings in Juba.
“Their quest for taking over the administration of SSOA as soon as possible with the aim of obstructing the smooth implementation process of R-ARCSS prompted them to bend the Regulation and Procedures of election,” he concluded.

Title: 294 Sudanese MPs introduce bill to scrap presidential term limit - Sudan Tribune
Sudan Tribune

President Omer al-Bashir gestures as he addresses the crowd in Al-Fashir, North Darfur, Sudan April 1, 2016. R(euters Photo)December 4, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese lawmakers representing 33 political parties Tuesday have introduced a bill to amend the constitution to allow President Omer al-Bashir to run for a third term in 2020 elections.
Al-Bashir’s term ends in 2020 and he couldn’t run for office again according to the constitution. Also, the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) statute limits to two terms the nomination of the party candidate for the presidential elections.
However, the NCP Shura (consultative) Council last August amended party statute allowing al-Bashir to stay for a third term as party leader in a move that is largely seen as a prelude to amend the country’s constitution to allow him to run for presidency.
The proposed amendments bill was signed by 294 MPs and provides to abolish presidential term limits.
The head of the parliamentary sub-committee on industry Abdallah  Masar told reporters that the proposed bill contains 57 amendments pertaining to the presidential term limits.
He described the move as “important national issue”, saying the amendments allow the president to sack the elected governors of states for a number of reasons including violation of “loyalty and obedience” to the president.
Al-Bashir who came to power through a coup d’état in June 1989 will have ruled Sudan for 31 years by the year 2020.
In March 2012, the Sudanese president said he wouldn’t seek his re-election in April 2015 but he ran and won in an election that was boycotted by the major opposition parties.
Also, in August 2016, he said “I’m not a dictator and I don’t want to cling to power. I won’t run for another term, my term will end by 2020 and I won’t be able to run again according to the constitution and the constitution won’t be amended”
However, last September he openly declared his readiness for the elections after his nomination for the party’s candidate by the NCP Shura (Consultative).

President Omer al-Bashir gestures as he addresses the crowd in Al-Fashir, North Darfur, Sudan April 1, 2016. R(euters Photo)December 4, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – Sudanese lawmakers representing 33 political parties Tuesday have introduced a bill to amend the constitution to allow President Omer al-Bashir to run for a third term in 2020 elections.
Al-Bashir’s term ends in 2020 and he couldn’t run for office again according to the constitution. Also, the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) statute limits to two terms the nomination of the party candidate for the presidential elections.
However, the NCP Shura (consultative) Council last August amended party statute allowing al-Bashir to stay for a third term as party leader in a move that is largely seen as a prelude to amend the country’s constitution to allow him to run for presidency.
The proposed amendments bill was signed by 294 MPs and provides to abolish presidential term limits.
The head of the parliamentary sub-committee on industry Abdallah  Masar told reporters that the proposed bill contains 57 amendments pertaining to the presidential term limits.
He described the move as “important national issue”, saying the amendments allow the president to sack the elected governors of states for a number of reasons including violation of “loyalty and obedience” to the president.
Al-Bashir who came to power through a coup d’état in June 1989 will have ruled Sudan for 31 years by the year 2020.
In March 2012, the Sudanese president said he wouldn’t seek his re-election in April 2015 but he ran and won in an election that was boycotted by the major opposition parties.
Also, in August 2016, he said “I’m not a dictator and I don’t want to cling to power. I won’t run for another term, my term will end by 2020 and I won’t be able to run again according to the constitution and the constitution won’t be amended”

Title: IDPs call to investigate beating of Central Darfur returnees during weapons collection exercise - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
March 11, 2018 (ZALINGEI) - Representatives of internally displaced persons (IDPs) condemned the recent beating and humiliation of civilians during an arms collection exercise in Central Darfur State and called to investigate the incident.
A video clip that was widely circulated on social media this week showed Sudanese government forces humiliating and beating dozens of men of Artala area in a Central Darfur State to force them to reveal the whereabouts of weapons caches.
The deputy head of Darfur Refugees and Displaced Persons Association, Adam Abdalla told Sudan Tribune on Saturday that the forces involved in the collection of weapons in Central Darfur "have tortured and humiliated civilians in front of women and children to force them to hand over weapons they do not possess".
Abdalla said the joint forces, composed mostly of the Rapid Support Forces ( RSF) militiamen, surrounded the market of Artala area inhabited by the returnees, located 75 km southeast of Zalingei the capital of Central Darfur and beat the civilians using sticks, rifle butts and whips in an attempt to extract confessions of illegal possession of weapons.
"The residents of the area are all returnees who do not have any weapons," he stressed.
The IDPs representative further called on the UN hybrid peacekeeping mission (UNAMID) to investigate into the assault which he described as "a disgrace to humanity."
Artala which is part of MUKJAR district lies on the border with South Darfur State. The area is inhabited by civilians from the Fur tribe, most of whom were in Kalma camp for displaced persons near Nyala.
There are about 600 families that have returned to settle in the area since 2015.
JEM CONDEMNS
Also, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) "strongly" condemned the attack on civilians by the "tribal militias" describing the incident as another " blatant violation of human rights".
JEM "appeals to the international community to use all the means at its disposal to stop these outrageous violations of international humanitarian law".
"The vulnerable civilians of the marginalised regions, in particular women and children who make the majority of the population of IDP camps, deserve the application of the principle of "need to protect".

Plural news and views on Sudan
President Omer al-Bashir speaks to police senior officers at the headquarters of the “police house” in Burri suburb on December 30, 2018. (AFP Photo)December 31, 2018, (KHARTOUM) – Statements of Sudanese President Ome al-Bashir about police use of violence are “raising concern about more bloodshed” said Human Rights Watch on Sunday.
Speaking to the police senior officers on Sunday ahead of nationwide protests planned for Monday, al-Bashir said the police have to  “maintain security but without arbitrariness (or excessive violence) by applying all internal security principles and using the least possible force,” he said.
He further cautioned that their goal is not to kill people but to preserve security and protect public and private property.
However, al-Bashir statements exhorting the police to use the “least possible force” against the peaceful protesters was seen by many as implying that police can use violence and triggered massive reactions all over the social media and was condemned by rights groups.
“President al-Bashir appears to be making public speeches that justify excessive use of force instead of condemning this brutality,” said Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch in a statement released on Sunday evening.
Also, Sudan Human Rights Network (SHRN) issued a statement condemning the statement saying “deeply concerned about Omer al-Bashir’s recent statement to police officers to kill protesters in Sudan”.
Henry further stressed that the Sudanese authorities an “unambiguous message” to the security forces stating not to use lethal force against the protesters.
There are conflicting reports about the death toll as Amnesty International said 37 people were killed and the opposition alliance on Sunday said it has reached 40 victims. However, the Sudanese government acknowledged that only 19 were killed.
HRW pointed to the need to immediately investigate “all reported killings, injuries, unlawful detentions, and torture and ill-treatment of detainees and hold those responsible to account”.

Three youths who reported to a recruitment area for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in South Darfur died of heat exhaustion on Sunday after spending the day in searing heat without shelter.
Three youths who reported to a recruitment area for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in South Darfur died of heat exhaustion on Sunday after spending the day in searing heat without shelter.
Informed sources told Radio Dabanga that the government began a recruitment drive for the RSF a week ago. Recruits, some under the age of 18, were ordered to report to an area near Kesholingo village in South Darfur.
“They were waiting on a totally barren piece of land without any trees or shelter from the sun,” the source said.
The death of three of the youths prompted the RSF to change the mustering point to a forested area three kilometres south Kesholingo, where potential recruits can take shelter under trees.

December 12, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – A Chinese peacekeeping force including 100 blue helmets on Tuesday has travelled to Sudan to take part in a one-year peacekeeping mission in the Darfur region, said China’s Ministry of National Defence
A Chinese soldier from an engineering unit practice at an army camp in Qinyang, Henan province September 15, 2007 (Reuters)According to China’s official news agency Xinhua, the Defence Ministry said this is the first group of a peacekeeping team including 225 blue helmets, pointing out that the rest of the team would head to Darfur next Tuesday.
It added the Chinese blue helmets would be tasked “with maintaining supplies and engineering projects, restoring buildings, and constructing and repairing houses, roads and airports”.
It is noteworthy that China had previously sent an engineering team including 109 peacekeepers to Darfur to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission for one year.
China currently contributes more than 2000 blue helmets to the UN peacekeeping missions in nine countries including South Sudan, Mali and Liberia.
In June 2017, the African Union and the UN decided to draw down the hybrid peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) by withdrawing the military personnel by 44% and that of the police component by 30%, the closure of 11 team sites in the first phase and the withdrawal of the military component from another 7 team sites in the second phase.
The UN Security Council (UNSC) admitted that the security situation in Darfur has improved but it decided to reinforce its presence in the mountainous area of Jebel Marra because there is no cessation of hostilities as a Sudan Liberation Movement faction led by Abdel Wahid al-Nur (SLM-AW) refuses to declare a unilateral truce or to engage in peace negotiations.
Last July, the UNSC unanimously decided to extend for one year the mandate of the UNAMID and also to reduce the number of its troops in line with an exit strategy aiming to close the hybrid operation in two years.
The hybrid mission has been deployed in Darfur since December 2007 with a mandate to stem violence against civilians in western Sudan’s region.
It is the world’s second-largest international peacekeeping force with an annual budget of $1.35 billion and almost 20,000 troops. UN agencies estimate that over 300,000 people were killed in the Darfur conflict since 2003, and over 2.5 million are displaced.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia have been accused of illegally confiscating of 321 vehicles from their owners during the past ten days at the area of Jebel Eisa near the town of El Malha, that sees much traffic across the border to Libya, without explaining the reasons.
In an interview with Radio Dabanga, MP Siham Hasan said that 10 days ago, 26 large trucks, 240 small vehicles, two agricultural tractors, a bulldozer, and a crane were confiscated. Last week, 22 vehicles from El Malha area, three large vehicles, and 26 small vehicles from the Karib El Tom area were transferred to Rizig area, one of the headquarters of the RSF militia.
Hasan considered the act as illegal and would cause damage and financial losses to the owners.

Title: قائد مليشيا متهمة بجرائم حرب يوزع ٥٠ ألف مصحف – صحيفة التغيير السودانية , اخبار السودان
التغيير: الخرطوم
أعلنت مليشيات الدعم السريع المتهمة بارتكاب فظائع وجرائم حرب في السودان عن طبع وتوزيع ٥٠ ألف نسخة من القرآن الكريم في وقت اعتبر فيه قائدها حميدتي أن البلاد محفوظة بقواته ورجال الدين.
وتتهم قوات الدعم السريع (الجنجويد سابقا) بارتكاب فظائع وجرائم حرب في دارفور إلا أن ممارساتها امتدت الى بقية أجزاء السودان.
وارتكبت هذه القوات جرائم في كسلا والخرطوم والنيل الأبيض والأبيض قبل أن يطردها والي ولاية شمال كردفان من الاقليم بعد ازياد الشكاوى ضدها.
الا أن البشير ظل يطلق عليها عبارات الثناء وأنها ” المخزون الاستراتيجي” حتى  آخر خطاب له بمدينة الأبيض قبل ايام  إذ أشار  الى أنه نشر “ناسه” من قوات الدعم السريع في ام روابة لوقف هجمات التمرد.
واعتبر المراقبون الإعلان تأكيدا على إضعاف الجيش النظامي.
وفي ذات السياق تداولت مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي قبل ثلاثة أيام فيديو يظهر قوات بزي عسكري تجلد مواطنين بالسياط .   وأكد ان قوات المشتركة مكونة في غالبها من منسوبي (الدعم السريع) طوقت الأسبوع الماضي سوق منطقة “ارتالا ” للعودة الطوعية -75 كلم جنوب شرق مدينة زالنجي عاصمة وسط دارفور وانهالوا بالضرب على المواطنين مستخدمين العصى واعقاب البنادق والسياط في محاولة لانتزاع اعترافات بحيازة أسلحة.

وأوضح آدم أن اهالي المنطقة في الاصل نازحون عادوا الى إليها في وقت سابق ولا يملكون اية أسلحة، وتابع “انهم مواطنون عزل من الدرجة الأولى”
وتتبع “ارتالا” لمحلية مكجر بولاية وسط دارفور على الحدود مع جنوب دارفور، ويقطنها منتمون لقبيلة الفور، نزح غالبهم الى مخيم (كلما).

وقال  حميدتي إن قوات “الدعم السريع” تتشرف بطباعة 50 ألف مصحف وتوزيعها للمواطنين في البلاد، الذي من شأنه أن يعمل على توحيد أهل السودان ويبعث القيم الفاضلة والسلوك القويم.

وأوضح حميدتي لدى مخاطبته يوم الإثنين، في الخرطوم، تدشين مشروع “كتاب الله يوحدنا” بتوزيع 50 ألف مصحف للخلاوى القرآنية والمساجد والمؤسسات الدينية.

Title: Sudanese refugees in Chad short of basics - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Sudanese refugees in Chad are suffering from a shortage of supplies of basic commodities such as sugar and cooking oil. Supply lorries have been prevented from reaching the camps.
Sudanese refugees in Chad are suffering from a shortage of supplies of basic commodities such as sugar and cooking oil. Supply lorries have been prevented from reaching the camps.
A sheik of the refugee camps in Chad told Radio Dabanga that Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia prevent commercial supply lorries moving from Sudan to Chad from carrying certain goods.
“These measures have led to the disappearance of sugar and oil from the markets which have negatively affected the lives of most of the refugees in the camps,” the sheikh said.
Sudan’s President Omar Al Bashir has instructed the acceleration of work on the voluntary repatriation ofSudanese refugees in Chad and the return of Chadian refugees in Sudan.
Accelerated return
In January, Interior Minister Babikir Digna reported after a meeting with Al Bashir in his office at the Republican Palace that the meeting discussed the situation of the country's refugees abroad, the process of electronic registration, and providing a national number to each of them.
The minister said that the president stressed the need to prepare sites for the return of the refugees returning from Chad in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the government of Chad so as to speed up the implementation of the return of the Sudanese to their homes in Darfur.
4,000 Chadian refugees return
In December 2017, theUNHCR reportedthat more than 4,000 Chadian refugees in Central Darfur have started their voluntary return home after more than ten years in a Darfur refugee camp.
A first group of approximately 301 Chadians have left Um Shalaya camp in Central Darfur for Moudeina in the Sila region of eastern Chad.
The refugee agency and the governments of Sudan and Chad provided transport and additional assistance to the refugees.
The UNHCR expected that by the end of 2017, some 1,000 refugees will have returned to Moudeina and the agency plans to return as many as 4,000 refugees to other sites in Chadin 2018. The returnees will receive 'return packages' to help them re-establish their homes and livelihoods.
Sudanese refugees
Chad is itself an important refugee host country with over 300,000 people from Darfur living in camps in the east of the country.
In October 2017, Sudanese refugee leaders returned to their home villages for the first time this week on go-and-see visits organised by UNHCR. After more than a decade in exile, Sudanese refugees begin to look more seriously at returning to Darfur. In Chad the refugees face dwindling humanitarian support, with cuts to food rations, and limited livelihood opportunities and access to land. There are alsoconcernsabout the language of instruction for their children’s education.
