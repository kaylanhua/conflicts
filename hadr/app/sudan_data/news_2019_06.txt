KHARTOUM, June 13 (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it had confirmed the killing of 17 people and the burning of more than 100 houses in Deleij village in the Darfur region of Sudan earlier this week.
The United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur also said 15 people were injured and the violence "occurred during heated clashes between nomads and residents apparently angered by the increase in commodity prices at the local market".
Opposition medics said "Janjaweed militias" fired live ammunition at civilians on Monday at a market in Deleij, Central Darfur, killing 11 people and wounding 20 others.
The Janjaweed are Arab militias who have been accused of committing atrocities in Darfur, in the west of Sudan, during a civil conflict that started in 2003 and, according to U.N. estimates, has killed up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million.
Ousted President Omar al-Bashir's government denied the allegations on Darfur.
Janjaweed fighters were incorporated into Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been the dominant force in the capital Khartoum since Bashir was overthrown on April 11.
The deputy head of the military council that took power after Bashir left, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, heads the RSF.
Witnesses said the RSF led a raid on a protest sit-in in Khartoum on June 3 that left dozens dead and led to the collapse of talks between the military council and protest and opposition groups pushing for a democratic transition.
The military council has said forces moved in to deal with disruptive groups near the sit-in and the violence spread from there. It also said that some RSF members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation.
This week Amnesty International said it had new evidence showing that "Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur".
At least 45 villages were completely or partially destroyed in the past year, Amnesty said.
"In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we've witnessed the Rapid Support Forces' despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years," said Amnesty Secretary General Kumi Naidoo.
"There are no Janjaweed elements currently in the national capital," said Major General Osman Mohamed Hamid, the RSF's operations commander.
"The Janjaweed are elements that were found in the period of armed movements in Darfur. These elements do not belong to a certain category, do not belong to a certain tribe," he said on Al-Hadath TV on Tuesday.
"They are elements rebelling against the law, harming every person in Darfur. [They are] elements that have no leadership, no structure." (Reporting by Khalid Abdelaziz; Writing by Yousef Saba; Editing by Frances Kerry)

Title: Deep Dive | Sudan crisis: Who are the dreaded Janjaweed militia? 
They say blue was his favourite colour.
And so, when 26-year-old Mohamed Mattar was gunned down during a horrific crackdown on protesters in Sudan’s capital city, Khartoum, on June 3, allegedly by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), social media users decided to express solidarity with the citizens of a country in turmoil with the hashtag “Blue for Sudan” and changed their profile pictures to the colour blue.
Mattar, an engineer, was shot down by members of the RSF while trying to protect two women during the vicious dispersal of protesters who were agitating outside the military headquarters in the city.
The RSF is a paramilitary group that has its roots in the Janjaweed, the dreaded armed militia that had reined terror during the conflict in the Darfur region in western Sudan almost a decade ago.
According to a doctors’ organisation that helped organise pro-democracy protests in the country, at least 100 people were massacred during the violent crackdown on June 3 by the Janjaweed and more than 40 bodies were reportedly pulled out from the river Nile by the militia group after the attack.
Who are the Janjaweed? How have they been responsible for the carnage and chaos presently gripping Sudan?
The fall of a dictator and the rise of brutality
In April 2019, the three-decade rule of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir came to an end as a result of the six-months-long peaceful protests by the citizens. The Sudanese military, which had played a role in the removal of the brutal dictator, along with the RSF set up a Transitional Military Council (TMC) as an interim government, much to the dismay of the pro-democracy protesters.
The military and representatives of citizens’ groups held meetings for three months to chalk out a plan for a smooth transition of power to a democratically-elected government. However, the talks fell through and the TMC scrapped all agreements made with the citizens’ groups and announced fresh elections in nine months, which activists and protesters fear may not be fair and unbiased.

That triggered a fresh set of agitations by the protesters earlier this month. However, the TMC has responded with ordering a ferocious crackdown on Sudanese protesters. Activists have alleged that the members of RSF or Janjaweed have killed, maimed and brutally raped hundreds of protesters since the last few weeks.
The history of Janjaweed
As perThe Telegraph, the Janjaweed militia is an “an irregular pro-government force accused of committing genocide against the region’s non-Arab population.”
The loose translation of the Arabic term ‘Janjaweed’ is ‘gunman on a horse’. It refers to a group of armed men from the 'Arab' community of Darfur and Kordofan in western Sudan. Historically, they have been in conflict with the settled darker-skinned African farmers in the region, according toThe Slate.
The origin of the militia dates back to the mid-1980s, when Darfur witnessed an increasing collapse of law and order, due to a number of factors including the continued neglect by Khartoum, severe drought and then eventual famine and civil war between north and south of Sudan. This prompted Darfurians to arm themselves to form their own militia groups, which subsequently gave birth to the group Janjaweed.
Till 2003, the conflicts in which the Janjaweed were involved were mostly related to the water and land resources of Darfur. However, post-2003, the armed group took on a more aggressive form after two non-Arab groups took on the Sudanese government claiming that their communities were being mistreated by the Arab rulers in Khartoum. That prompted the Janjaweed militias to plunder the towns and villages where the African tribes resided and used increasingly brutal methods to attack the non-Arab settlements.
The present-day Janjaweed
During his regime in the last six years, the former president Omar al-Bashir officially organised the Janjaweed militia as a legitimate paramilitary group called Rapid Support Forces, which function under the command of the National Intelligence and Security Services, according toThe Conversation. The government used this paramilitary group to suppress the activities of the rebel groups of the country.
During the Bashir regime, the number of RSF militants reportedly grew to 50,000,The New York Timesreported.
In 2013, Bashir appointed Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who belongs to one of the many Arab tribes of Darfur, as the head of the Janjaweed.
In 2014, the armed militia group was constitutionally recognised as a regular force.
The Rapid Support Forces has been accused of committing war crimes in Darfur in 2014 and 2015, as per the Human Rights Watch. The paramilitary group has been accused of looting, killing, displacing and raping hundreds of civilians during this period.
After Bashir was ousted from power, Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, became the Deputy Head of the Transitional Military Council. As per reports, even though the TMC is headed by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, it is believed that Hemedti is the de-facto leader of the country and the power centre of the interim government.
The fear of the return of brutality and savagery of Janjaweed in the country is very real for the many Sudanese people fighting for their democratic rights.
But so far, they have refused to give up. The fight for Sudan rages on.

Title: Who is Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo — the de-facto military ruler of Sudan?
One of the country’s most controversial military figures, Dagalo is now the interim vice president and holds real power in a country mired in chaos since the ousting of his mentor and Sudan’s long-standing ruler, Omar al Bashir, in April.
Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy head of the military council and head of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), greets his supporters as he attends a meeting in Khartoum, Sudan, June 18, 2019.
As Sudan’s political crisis has become more and more entangled after the toppling of its longest-serving ruler Omar al Bashir on April 11, one of his proteges, General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, is now calling the shots.
Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC) is officially run by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan. However, as far as power is concerned, many say that Dagalo, also known as Hemeti, is the top authority.
Bashir, the seventh president of Sudan, who had come to power via a coup in 1989, was deposed with a coupamidst mass protests. Ever since Bashir’s departure, the country has been run by the TMC, which is holding intense negotiations with the Freedom and Change Forces (FCF), an umbrella organisation of protesters.
The TMC and civilian leaders have been trying to come to terms over how to rule the country, but the talks have so far failed. At least 118 civilians were killed during the quashing of the protests. Pro-democracyactivistshave remained on the streets, demanding that the military relinquish control and ensure that a genuine civilian government is formed.
While there are images of Hemetidancingwith supporters in Khartoum, making him look like a fun and easygoing person, the truth is more sinister.
Hemeti’s Darfur sins
Hemeti has been linked to mass rapes and killings in Darfur in the war that started in 2003, joining the Janjaweed militia, described as “an irregular pro-government force accused of committinggenocideagainst the region’s non-Arab population,” according to the Telegraph.
According to a UN-appointed investigative body,Sudan’s government and the Hemeti-led Janjaweed militia has not committed genocide, but they have certainly been guilty of mass murders, torture, rape and other crimes in the Darfur region,creating the necessary conditionsfor a trial at the International Criminal Court for Hemeti and his top offcials
Earlier this month, on June 3, scores, maybe hundreds of people were shot, beaten and robbed by security forces called theRapid Support Forces (RSF), which are tightly connected with Hemeti, in Khartoum. Residents have reportedly begun referring to them as the Janjaweed, evoking the terror of the 2000s.
Hemeti does not appreciate the label. “Janjaweed means a bandit who robs you on the road,” Hemeti is reported astellingthe New York Times. “It’s just propaganda from the opposition.”
The New York Times puts the number of RSF at some 50,000, an impressive number of militants that Bashir had nurtured as a protective force. However, with Bashir now out of the picture, the RSF has grown to be a force to be reckoned with.
Saudi-UAE links
Hemeti also has close ties with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf states which fund and support autocratic regimes across the Middle East.
When Sudanese troops were fighting for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Hemeti’s RSF and Burhan’s ground forces fought together and the two men bonded,according to a Foreign Policy report.
The two men also reportedly “had meetings with Emirati and Saudi officials” introducing themselves as the ideal Arab military leaders “who were not Islamists friendly with Qatar, Iran or the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.”
Foreign Policy also reported that the RSF “reportedly received Saudi and Emirati support, including money and weapons”.
Sudanese protesters are deeplysuspiciousof Saudi and Emirate offers of help, angrily rejecting a $3bn aid pledge. Many have even demanded that TMC sever ties with both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The two states back Sudan’s new rulers and have been more influential in Sudanese politics since the latest coup in April.

Title: U.N. says it confirms 17 deaths in central Darfur region of Sudan
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it had confirmed the killing of 17 people and the burning of more than 100 houses in Deleij village in Sudan's central Darfur region earlier this week.
The United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur also said 15 people were injured and the violence "occurred during heated clashes between nomads and residents apparently angered by the increase in commodity prices at the local market".
Opposition medics said "Janjaweed militias" fired live ammunition at civilians on Monday at a market in Deleij, killing 11 people and wounding 20 others.
The Janjaweed are Arab militias who have been accused of committing atrocities in Darfur during a civil conflict that started in 2003 and, according to U.N. estimates, has killed up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million.
Ousted President Omar al-Bashir's government denied the allegations on Darfur.
Janjaweed fighters were incorporated into Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been the dominant force in the capital Khartoum since Bashir was overthrown on April 11.
The deputy head of the military council that took power after Bashir left, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, heads the RSF.
Witnesses said the RSF led a raid on a protest sit-in in Khartoum on June 3 that left dozens dead and led to the collapse of talks between the military council and protest and opposition groups pushing for a democratic transition.
The military council has said forces moved in to deal with disruptive groups near the sit-in and the violence spread from there. It also said that some RSF members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation.
This week Amnesty International said it had new evidence showing that "Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur".
At least 45 villages were completely or partially destroyed in the past year, Amnesty said.
"In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we've witnessed the Rapid Support Forces' despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years," said Amnesty Secretary General Kumi Naidoo.
The RSF could not be reached for comment.

Plural news and views on Sudan
al-Burhan shakes hands with MBZ on 9 May 2021 (ST photo)May 23, 2021 (KHARTOUM) – The United Arab Emirates  (UAE) withdrew its initiative to settle the border dispute between Sudan and Ethiopia, a news report said citing sources at the Sovereign Council.
The UAE proposed to establish agricultural schemes in the Al-Fashaqa area of Gadaref State. 25% of the claimed area will be cultivated by Ethiopian farmers, according to the initiative.
However, the Head of the Sovereign Council Abdel Fatah al-Burhan travelled to Abu Dhabi recently to inform the UAE leadership of Sudan’s demand to demarcate the border first before any project or presence of Ethiopian manpower in the area.
The Abu Dhabi based Asharq newspaper reported Sunday that the UAE had officially informed Sudan of the withdrawal of its initiative to resolve the border dispute between Sudan and Ethiopia.
In a letter to the Sudanese government, “the UAE affirmed its respect for Sudan’s position” about the need to place border markers first, further said the report citing sources at the Sudanese collegial presidency.
Sudanese officials say Ethiopia has reneged the border agreement signed in 1902, 1903 and 1972. They would not allow their presence of Ethiopian farmers again in the border area unless the markers are clearly established.
Sudan’s Finance Minister Girbil Ibrahim recently told the Sudan Tribune that the Gulf country had proposed to invest $8 billons in this project.
The head of the Sovereign Council flanked by the cabinet affairs minister had to travel to Abu Dhabi to reiterate Khartoum’s position after pledges made by his deputy to positively consider the UAE’s investment project, officials say in Khartoum.

Mohamed Hamdan "Hemedti" Dagalo is the vice-president of Sudan's ruling military junta and, at present, probably the most powerful man in Sudan.
He has the potential to shape the future of a broken country, but as the commander of one of Sudan's most prominent paramilitary forces, he leaves a trail of human rights abuse allegations from Darfur in his wake and has recently been accused of allowing those same forces tokill demonstrators in Khartoum.
Hemedti has said that the use of force was necessary in Darfur in order to protect its civilians and an "independent investigation" will be launched into the military's use of violence in Khartoum. Any person who had "crossed boundaries" would be punished, he said.
But he also defended the violence suppressing the protesters, explaining they had been infiltrated by rogue elements and drug dealers, and firm action was warranted.
"We will not allow chaos and we will not go back on our convictions," he said. "There is no way back. We must impose the respect of the country by law."
Hemedti was a close political ally of Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir, but as protests against the former leader escalated in December, his loyalty soon wavered.
When demonstrations in Khartoum began, Hemedti was the first high-ranking official to express his support, telling the government to "provide services and decent living to the people".
He said "the corrupt, whoever they are, should be referred to justice," the state-owned Sudanese News Agency reported on 25 December.
Hemedti switched sides to force the president out of power on 11 April and was named vice-president of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) two days later.
Although the TMC's president is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Hemedti is the one at the forefront of negotiations with Western diplomats.
He is reportedly supported by the politicians who created the Janjaweed, the militia comprising of Arab groups who sowed fear into residents of the Darfur region of western Sudan during the conflict there.
Image source,Reuters
BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane calls Hemedti"the most likely leader of a counter-revolution"and an "outsider" in the military elite.
Another factor behind Hemedti's power is his support from regional allies: Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Stability in Sudan is in their interest and they are very unlikely to impose sanctions on the TMC. However, Saudi Arabia has said it is concerned with developments in the region and urged the two sides to engage in dialogue.
According to Al Jazeera,Hemedti went to meet Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohamed Bin Salman earlier in May, promising to support the country against "all threats and attacks from Iran and Houthi militias" and to continue sending Sudanese troops to help the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.
It would be in the Saudi prince's interest to return the favour and maintain a strong relationship with Hemedti.
Hemedti grew up in a Chadian Arab clan, fleeing war to live in Darfur in the 1980s.
War in Darfur broke out in 2003, when marginalised black African clansmen in the region formed a rebel movement against the government. The army fought back, joined by paramilitary forces including the infamous Janjaweed, who were accused of riding their camels and horses into villages, killing the men, raping the women and stealing whatever they could find.
Image source,Getty Images
Since 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been investigating allegations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. The case involves a range of Sudanese government officials, and both Janjaweed and rebel leaders.
Hemedti's uncle is Juma Dagalo, a chief of one of the Arab groups which span the Chad-Sudan border.
Hemedti himself dropped out of primary school to trade camels and also offered security to commercial convoys in Darfur during the conflict. He was a savvy businessman and soon became rich, reports BBC Monitoring.
In 2003, as the Darfur rebellion began to gather momentum, Hemedti helped mobilise clansmen to fight alongside government forces. This earned him the support of President Bashir.
He became leader of the Border Guards, a group of Darfur militias supporting the government.
In 2013, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was formed to help regular forces fight rebels in Darfur. A year later, the group was recognised by the government as a "regular force", but critics say it is merely a reincarnation of the Janjaweed.
Former President Bashir is wanted by the ICC for the alleged war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.
Although he has not been named by the ICC, Human Rights Watch accuses Hemedti of overseeing civilian abuses including "torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes" in Darfur as well as in separate conflicts in the southern Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states.
Human Rights Watch said that during two counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur in 2014 and 2015, the RSF "burned and looted homes, beat, raped and executed villagers," supported by the Sudanese army and Janjaweed militia.
On 19 May 2014, Hemedti said that the RSF was protecting the people of Darfur. He warned that the RSF would "take a firm stance against anyone who tried to undermine the security and stability of citizens".
Chants about Darfur have played an active role in the latest protests in Khartoum, with demonstrators shouting: "We are all Darfur!" and "Darfur is our home! Revolution! Revolution!"
Despite witnessing Hemedti's alleged brutality in both Darfur and Khartoum, the unarmed protesters say they will not give up their fight.

Witnesses said the RSF led a raid on a protest sit-in in Khartoum on June 3 that left dozens dead and led to the collapse of talks between the military council and protest and opposition groups pushing for a democratic transition.
The military council has said forces moved in to deal with disruptive groups near the sit-in and the violence spread from there. It also said that some RSF members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation.
This week Amnesty International said it had new evidence showing that "Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur".
At least 45 villages were completely or partially destroyed in the past year, Amnesty said.
"In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we've witnessed the Rapid Support Forces' despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years," said Amnesty Secretary General Kumi Naidoo.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it had confirmed the killing of 17 people and the burning of more than 100 houses in Deleij village in the Darfur region of Sudan earlier this week.
The United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur also said 15 people were injured and the violence "occurred during heated clashes between nomads and residents apparently angered by the increase in commodity prices at the local market".
Opposition medics said "Janjaweed militias" fired live ammunition at civilians on Monday at a market in Deleij, Central Darfur, killing 11 people and wounding 20 others.
The Janjaweed are Arab militias who have been accused of committing atrocities in Darfur, in the west of Sudan, during a civil conflict that started in 2003 and, according to U.N. estimates, has killed up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million.
Ousted President Omar al-Bashir's government denied the allegations on Darfur.
Janjaweed fighters were incorporated into Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been the dominant force in the capital Khartoum since Bashir was overthrown on April 11.

"There are no Janjaweed elements currently in the national capital," said Major General Osman Mohamed Hamid, the RSF's operations commander.
"The Janjaweed are elements that were found in the period of armed movements in Darfur. These elements do not belong to a certain category, do not belong to a certain tribe," he said on Al-Hadath TV on Tuesday.
"They are elements rebelling against the law, harming every person in Darfur. [They are] elements that have no leadership, no structure."

Title: Amnesty, HRW warn UN against Sudan pullout - Digital Journal
Hi, what are you looking for?

Published
Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have warned UN peacekeepers against withdrawing from Sudan at a time when the Janjaweed militia is not only keeping up war crimes in Darfur but also taking its "despicable brutality" to Khartoum.
"It's hard to imagine a worse time to decide to close UNAMID," the United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur, said Jonathan Loeb, a senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International.
As a June 27 vote on whether to wind down UNAMID nears, Amnesty said it had "new evidence, including satellite imagery, showing that Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes... in Darfur".
"These have included the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings, and sexual violence," the rights group said in a statement issued Tuesday.
The RSF, formed from the former Janjaweed militia, were also responsible for the June 3 crackdown on protesters in Khartoum that killed dozens, Amnesty said.
"In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we've witnessed the Rapid Support Forces' despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians," it said.
New York-based Human Rights Watch, in a separate statement, said: "Instead of giving a green light to a continued drawdown of UNAMID, the (UN) Security Council should focus on preserving the mission's capabilities to protect civilians and monitor human rights abuses."
Amnesty's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, urged Sudan's ruling military council to "immediately withdraw the RSF from any policing and law enforcement operations, especially in Khartoum and Darfur".
A doctors committee linked to Sudan's protest movement said the Janjaweed had shot dead nine villagers in Central Darfur state on Monday.
The Janjaweed were first recruited when Khartoum trained and equipped Arab raiders to crush an ethnic minority rebellion in the vast western region of Darfur that erupted in 2003.
The United Nations says the conflict left more than 300,000 people dead and 2.5 million displaced.
The violence in Darfur has substantially reduced over the years, and the Janjaweed have been absorbed in the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan (Hemeti) Dagalo, the deputy chief of the military council which ousted longtime president Omar al-Bashir in April.
"Sudan's political instability inevitably has an impact on Darfur, especially given the rise of Hemeti and shocking news that (UNAMID) mission assets are going to his forces, despite the RSF's long track record of abuses," said Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at HRW.
"The RSF needs to be investigated for its abuses, not given tasks it's unfit for," Henry said.
Following Bashir's removal, protesters camped outside military headquarters in central Khartoum for weeks to demand civilian rule before they were violently dispersed last week.
"The case against closing UNAMID has been made even stronger" by the crackdown in the capital, said Amnesty.
Loeb said: "A decision to remove the last remaining peacekeepers from Darfur at this time would reveal a shocking lack of understanding about the current reality in Sudan."

Title: Sudan: UN says it confirmed 17 deaths in Darfur region violence | News | Al Jazeera
At least 15 others wounded and more than 100 houses burned in Deleij village earlier this week, according to the UN.
TheUnited Nationssays it has confirmed the killing of 17 people and the burning of more than 100 houses in a village inSudan‘s central Darfur region earlier this week.
Another 15 people inDeleij villagewere wounded, according to the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), which said on Thursday thatthe violence “occurred during heated clashes between nomads and residents apparently angered by the increase in commodity prices at the local market”.
The statement came days after medics linked to opposition protestershad said“Janjaweed” militias fired live ammunition at civilians on Monday at a market in Deleij, killing at least nine people and wounding 20 others.
“Yesterday, they fired live ammunition on citizens in the souk ofDeleij,” the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said in a statement on Tuesday. “Following the systematic massacre, the doctors in the area ofDeleijreceived 11 dead and 20 wounded,” it added.
“The doctors confirmed that nine citizens were killed by bullets and sticks of the Janjaweed. However, the cause of death of the other two or who they were was unclear,” the committee said, adding the militia had “spread death on citizens for ages”.
The Janjaweed are Arab militias who have been accused of committing atrocities in Darfur during a civil conflict that started in 2003 and, according to UN estimates, has killed up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million.




The government of former President Omar al-Bashir had denied the allegations on Darfur.
Janjaweed fighters were incorporated into Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been the dominant force in the capital, Khartoum, since Bashir was overthrown by the military on April 11 after months of mass protests against his three-decade authoritarian rule.
The deputy head of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) that seized power after al-Bashir’s removal, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemeti, heads the RSF.
Witnesses said the RSF led araid on a protest sit-inin Khartoum on June 3 that left dozens dead and led to the collapse of talks between the TMC and protest leaders pushing for a democratic transition.
The TMC has said forces moved in to deal withdisruptive groupsnear the sit-in and the violence spread from there. It also said that some RSF members had been attacked and that people had put on their uniforms to impersonate them in an attempt to harm their reputation.

Title: Activists report militia attacks, killings in Darfur 
Meanwhile Sudani Telecom, a state communications network, was reported to be messaging Sudanese residents saying that 'groups' were attempting to get weapons to 'transfer battles to the city'.  Meanwhile, activists report that weapons have been left around in what they view maybe an attempt to encourage citizens to engage in fighting, while protesters have remained determined avoid violence.As internet has been cut off in Sudan, it is increasingly difficult to confirm reports from the country.Heavily armed and dressed in desert fatigues, Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have made their presence felt in Khartoum since military generals cracked down on a long-running sit-in.
Piled onto pickup trucks mounted with machine guns or patrolling the streets on foot, they are seen by some protesters as a new version of the infamous Janjaweed militias accused of horrific abuses in Darfur.
The RSF is a paramilitary force led by the deputy head of the ruling Transitional Military Council, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, nicknamed Himeidti.
Dagalo was a former leader of one of the Arab Janjaweed militias at the height of the conflict in Darfur that started in 2003.
The Janjaweed militias were recruited when Khartoum trained and equipped Arab raiders to crush an ethnic minority rebellion in the area.
The groups were sent to attack villages on camel and horseback as part of a campaign of terror that saw now ousted president Omar al-Bashir indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

e has faced multiple arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his actions in Darfur, including “genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Though the warrants were filed in 2009 and 2010, respectively, he was never arrested by the any of the countries which signed onto the Rome Statute. The treaty requires participating countries to arrest international fugitives who cross their borders, but, in spite of this, long-term Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir continued to visit several countries across Africa, evading arrest for war crimes in the Darfur region for over a decade.
Now, al-Bashir is under arrest in his own country. His removal from power came after several months of protesting, which originally started over the dilapidated state of Sudan’s economy in December 2018 and later focused on removing al-Bashir from power. In early April 2019, thousands camped outside of Sudan’s military headquarters, near the presidential compound, in peaceful protest. By April 11, 2019, al-Bashir had been ousted.
In Sudan, al-Bashir could face trial as early as next week, though policy experts and activists in Sudan have argued that the rush to trial was designed to distract the international community from the violence that has broken out in the country in the wake of al-Bashir’s removal. On June 3, soldiers and paramilitary groups in Sudan opened fire on a group of protesters who had been participating in a pro-democracy sit-in in the capital city of Khartoum, leaving at least 118 dead. Violence escalated as soldiers raped women, burned tents, and dumped the bodies of victims into the River Nile.
And though al-Bashir has been ousted, his violent legacy looms over the current conflict in Sudan. The paramilitary group that is seen as responsible for much of the recent violence in Sudan is known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). In Sudan’s capital city, the RSF grew out of the military forces that made up the Janjaweed, the paramilitary group that terrorized the Darfur region in Sudan, initiating genocide in the early 2000s. The new Sudanese crisis emerges from the ashes of Darfur, asking repentance from the same perpetrators and claiming new victims in its wake.
Much like current conflict in Sudan, violence in Darfur began with action against the al-Bashir regime. In April 2003, rebels in Darfur raided Sudan’s main air base. They were angry with the Sudanese government for what they perceived as disregard towards the state’s non-Arab population. al-Bashir’s regime turned to the Janjaweed, an Arab militia group that had formed in the 1980s to protect the Darfur region from a variety of vulnerabilities. In the wake of the Darfuri rebellion, al-Bashir’s regime intensified recruitment efforts for the Janjaweed militia, enlisting criminals and prisoners to quash the uprisings in the region. al-Bashir’s government instructed the Janjaweed to go after the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa villages. Ultimately, the militia killed hundreds of thousands in what became known to the international community as a genocide of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa people.
Years later, the Janjaweed’s reign of terror has extended beyond the Darfur region. In 2013, the al-Bashir regime formed the RSF from the remnants of the Janjaweed militias to combat armed rebel groups in Sudan. In 2014, Sudan recognized the RSF as a regular military force in its constitution. True to its Janjaweed roots, the RSF contributed to the crisis in Darfur; the force has been found guilty of committing various human rights abuses in Darfur in 2014 and 2015, including looting homes and beating, raping, and killing civilians.
Currently, the RSF is led by a military commander, General Hamdan, more commonly known as Hemeti. Hemeti had served as a leader in the Janjaweed forces during the early days of the Darfur conflict, and became the leader of the RSF in 2013. That same year, the RSF repressed protestors at demonstrations in Khartoum, killing at least 200. And history repeated itself during the most recent attacks in Sudan’s capital city, which were of course also carried out by the paramilitary force.
Now, Hemeti is considered to be the de facto leader of Sudan, and has his sights set on becoming the country’s next president. Like al-Bashir, Hemeti was never held accountable for his actions in Darfur. Failure to arrest prominent war criminals contributes to a growing scheme of international inaction in Darfur. U.S. diplomats, for example, chose Southern Sudanese independence in an implicit trade-off between the creation of South Sudan or the achievement of justice for the Darfur region. South Sudan became the world’s youngest country in 2011. The conflict in Darfur remains unresolved. And the U.S. is not alone is its complacency. In 2016, the EU began to work with the Sudanese government and Hemeti’s RSF to help curtail migration in the region, a project they began with full knowledge of Hemeti’s former war crimes in Darfur. Writing for American political magazine The New Republic, journalist Justin Lynch said it best. Though military leaders like Hemeti are directly responsible for current Sudanese violence, international inaction in the wake of Darfur set the stage for the attacks in Khartoum.
As the RSF continues to bring “Darfur to Khartoum,” the international community still has a chance to take action. Op-eds emerging from both the U.S. and the U.K. have argued that countries should take efforts to halt illicit financial activity with Sudan and create financial consequences for regime leaders in the country. Additional recommendations have advised countries to place sanctions on human rights offenders in Sudan and have called for public statements condemning the use of violence in the country to quell peaceful protests. Ultimately, the world’s focus on Sudan in the aftermath of its June bloodbath mustn’t be broken. Unwavering international attention is needed in Khartoum if the international community wants to halt another Darfur.

H
e has faced multiple arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his actions in Darfur, including “genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Though the warrants were filed in 2009 and 2010, respectively, he was never arrested by the any of the countries which signed onto the Rome Statute. The treaty requires participating countries to arrest international fugitives who cross their borders, but, in spite of this, long-term Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir continued to visit several countries across Africa, evading arrest for war crimes in the Darfur region for over a decade.
Now, al-Bashir is under arrest in his own country. His removal from power came after several months of protesting, which originally started over the dilapidated state of Sudan’s economy in December 2018 and later focused on removing al-Bashir from power. In early April 2019, thousands camped outside of Sudan’s military headquarters, near the presidential compound, in peaceful protest. By April 11, 2019, al-Bashir had been ousted.
In Sudan, al-Bashir could face trial as early as next week, though policy experts and activists in Sudan have argued that the rush to trial was designed to distract the international community from the violence that has broken out in the country in the wake of al-Bashir’s removal. On June 3, soldiers and paramilitary groups in Sudan opened fire on a group of protesters who had been participating in a pro-democracy sit-in in the capital city of Khartoum, leaving at least 118 dead. Violence escalated as soldiers raped women, burned tents, and dumped the bodies of victims into the River Nile.
And though al-Bashir has been ousted, his violent legacy looms over the current conflict in Sudan. The paramilitary group that is seen as responsible for much of the recent violence in Sudan is known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). In Sudan’s capital city, the RSF grew out of the military forces that made up the Janjaweed, the paramilitary group that terrorized the Darfur region in Sudan, initiating genocide in the early 2000s. The new Sudanese crisis emerges from the ashes of Darfur, asking repentance from the same perpetrators and claiming new victims in its wake.
Much like current conflict in Sudan, violence in Darfur began with action against the al-Bashir regime. In April 2003, rebels in Darfur raided Sudan’s main air base. They were angry with the Sudanese government for what they perceived as disregard towards the state’s non-Arab population. al-Bashir’s regime turned to the Janjaweed, an Arab militia group that had formed in the 1980s to protect the Darfur region from a variety of vulnerabilities. In the wake of the Darfuri rebellion, al-Bashir’s regime intensified recruitment efforts for the Janjaweed militia, enlisting criminals and prisoners to quash the uprisings in the region. al-Bashir’s government instructed the Janjaweed to go after the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa villages. Ultimately, the militia killed hundreds of thousands in what became known to the international community as a genocide of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa people.
Years later, the Janjaweed’s reign of terror has extended beyond the Darfur region. In 2013, the al-Bashir regime formed the RSF from the remnants of the Janjaweed militias to combat armed rebel groups in Sudan. In 2014, Sudan recognized the RSF as a regular military force in its constitution. True to its Janjaweed roots, the RSF contributed to the crisis in Darfur; the force has been found guilty of committing various human rights abuses in Darfur in 2014 and 2015, including looting homes and beating, raping, and killing civilians.

Title: Sudan's RSF, 'new version' of Darfur's Arab militias | Daily Mail Online
ByAfp
Published:15:34 EDT, 6 June 2019|Updated:15:34 EDT, 6 June 2019


Heavily armed and dressed in desert fatigues, Sudan´s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have made their presence felt in Khartoum since military generals cracked down on a long-running sit-in.
Piled onto pickup trucks mounted with machine guns or patrolling the streets on foot, they are seen by some protesters as a new version of the infamous Janjaweed militias accused of horrific abuses in Darfur.
The RSF is a paramilitary force led by the deputy head of the ruling Transitional Military Council, Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, nicknamed Himeidti.
Dagalo was a former leader of one of the Arab Janjaweed militias at the height of the conflict in Darfur that started in 2003.
The Janjaweed militias were recruited when Khartoum trained and equipped Arab raiders to crush an ethnic minority rebellion in the area.
The groups were sent to attack villages on camel and horseback as part of a campaign of terror that saw now ousted president Omar al-Bashir indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
In 2013, during clashes between the Arab militias and the security forces in Darfur, "Dagalo was one of the few commanders to stay loyal to the regime, which got him chosen for the RSF -- the new paramilitary force aiming to control and strengthen the Janjaweed," said Jerome Tubiana, a researcher specialised in Sudan.
Under the control of Sudan's powerful National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) and then the presidency, the RSF was sent to fight insurgents in Darfur, and in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.
But the force was accused by rights groups of abuses against civilians in Darfur, such as rape, extrajudicial killings, looting, torture and burning villages.
In 2014, the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda called them the "new version of the Janjaweed".
That same year, Abbas Abdelaziz, the NISS officer jointly in charge of the force with Dagalo, said calling the RSF "Janjaweed" was an insult, insisting the men had combat experience and had "become professionals".
According to him, the force was then made up of 6,000 members, 1,500 of whom were from the Sudanese armed forces.
Between 2017 and 2018, "several thousand of the RSF were heavily rearmed (and given training by Russians) in a bid to protect Bashir", Tubiana said.
But all that changed in April when demonstrators launched the sit-in outside army headquarters in Khartoum to demand the departure of Bashir.
Himeidti refused to break up the sit-in, Tubiana said.
The protest allowed the army to topple Bashir, after three decades of authoritarian rule.
On Monday security personnel attacked demonstrators at the sit-in site outside army headquarters in Khartoum.
Witnesses said RSF were at the forefront of a "massacre" that had left dozens dead and hundreds wounded, and referred to the attackers as "Janjaweed".
In Yemen, the RSF have fought alongside the regular Sudanese army in the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Iran-backed Houthi rebels since 2015.

Title: Opinion|The Janjaweed and the Mathiang Anyoor : Different objectives but same tactics - Radio Tamazuj

Independent News Crossing Borders
The massacre in cold blood that took place in front of the Sudanese Military Headquarters in Khartoum stunned the Sudanese people and the world at large. As tensions mounted between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the sit-inners, people expected in the worst case scenario for the authorities to disperse the gathering using riot police methods.
The massacre in cold blood that took place in front of the Sudanese Military Headquarters in Khartoum stunned the Sudanese people and the world at large. As tensions mounted between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the sit-inners, people expected in the worst case scenario for the authorities to disperse the gathering using riot police methods.
Such methods usually involve the use of tear gas, water cannons, rubber Bullets, and sticks. Alas! Instead, the sounds of gunfire broke the relative quietness of the morning hours of Monday the 3rd. of June 2019, which was 29 days into the fasting of Ramadan. Instantly, the screams of the injured and those calling for help and ambulance service rose from the vicinity of the sit-in before the Military headquarters. Many sit-inners exhibited courage and bravery as they continued to carry their injured colleagues under gunfire.
Whoever issued the order to shoot to kill the sit-inners displayed the highest degree of brutality and total disregard for human life. We note that a few days before the incidence, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglo (Hemedti), the commander of the Rapid Support Force (RSF), emphasized the need to call off the on-going sit-in and remove the barricades from the roads. Also, the video clip of this tragic incident that was shown on Aljazeera TV revealed the attackers in the distinctive uniforms of the RSF.
Deposed President Omar Al Bashir formed the RSF from the infamous Janjaweed Arab Militia that terrorized the non-Arab communities in Darfur over the past few decades. In essence, the RSF is the Janjaweed itself. Its leader, Hemedti, was a camel trader before becoming a Janjaweed warlord. His rise in power was remarkable thanks to Ex-President Omar Al Bashir who elevated him to the rank of Lt. General and opening the door for him to play a national role.The name Janjaweed has become familiar over the past decade or so particularly whenever genocide is mentioned. It gained notoriety following the Darfur massacres where hundreds of thousands of civilians lost their lives in wanton killings. They are accused of crimes against humanity, rape, forced transfer of civilians, and torture. Two of the Janjaweed leaders are indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague but haven't been apprehended yet. The ICC is seeking to prosecute the tribal leader Musa Hilal and the Janjaweed commander Ali Khushayb for whom an arrest warrant has been issued. Musa Hilal has worked closely with General Hemedti (his cousin) under President Omar Al Bashir direct control. But a fall out between the President and Hemedti on one side and Musa Hilal on the other led to Hemedti attacking Musa Hilal's stronghold in Mustariyha in Northern Darfur State with the total defeat of Hilal's forces. Musa Hilal ended up being flown in chains to Khartoum.
The analogy between the Janjaweed and Mathiang Anyoor involves many aspects of their compositions and activities. They are both tribal militias formed from one ethnicity in each case. The Janjaweed are members of the Arab nomadic tribes that inhabit Darfur, North and West Kordofan. Some of the Janjaweed members came from places as far as Chad, Mali, Cameroon, and Niger. As for the Mathiang Anyoor, they hail from the Jieng ethnic group of Bahr Al Ghazal particularly from Warrap and Northern Bahr Al Ghazal States.
The Janjaweed and the Mathiang Anyoor are both used to consolidate the power of their respective Presidents and to crush any opposition against them. Ex-President Omar Al Bashir was unsure of the loyalty of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) towards his regime; thus, he established the RSF and strengthened it at the expense of the SAF.
In the case of President Kiir, he wouldn't trust forces from other ethnicities to back him up in implementing the policies that were laid down by the Jieng Council of elders (JCE).  There hasn't been any recruitment into the army nor the other security sectors from communities other than the Jieng community. Those recruits (Mathiang Anyoor) together with some units of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA) were the ones used to execute the massacre of the Nuer Civilians in Juba on December 15, 2013. The horrific crimes committed by the Mathiang Anyoor in the greater Equatoria States and Western Bahr Ghazal State are comparable to the heinous crimes committed by the Janjaweed in Darfur.
At any rate, the policies of exclusivity and purging those purported to be disloyal to the regime yielded a tribal army and security sector in South Sudan under full control of President Kiir. Even at the time when he's expected to implement the so-called Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) in spirit and letter – he travels to Warrap, his home State to recruit yet another batch of thousands of Mathiang Anyoor militia. For those who thought the R-ARCSS would lead to the establishment of a national army, I would say; think again!
In Sudan, the above policies led to the RSF, seemingly assuming the role of the SAF with full loyalty to President Al Bashir and the National Congress Party (NCP). But underneath the portrayal of the RSF as a national institution lies the ugly face of racial prejudices, persecution, and marginalization of those from the Nuba Mountains, the Blue Nile area, and Darfur.
The fundamental question is; where would all these unwise policies lead the two countries? Of course, the situation is rapidly changing in Sudan after the fall of President Al Bashir. But the remnants of his regime are working day and night to hijack the Sudanese People's revolution and maintain the status quo. The policies of marginalization of some communities and unequal wealth sharing would not lead to unity and prosperity in Sudan. It would instead push the disenfranchised communities to follow the same path that led to the secession of South Sudan. The Sudanese revolution is probably the last chance for Sudan to save itself from utter destruction and chaos.
It appears some influential politicians in South Sudan need to learn from history lessons. South Sudan is a multiethnic and multicultural country. It can only survive in a political system that ensures unity in diversity while safeguarding the rights of all the communities no matter how small or large they are. At present, South Sudan is a nation in evolution. It needs leadership that builds bridges between communities while ensuring inclusivity and justice for all the people. Well, the regime in Juba is doing just the contrary. Topping the list of the world's Failed States and the second position on the list of the most corrupt countries on the planet seem not to bother President Kiir and his clique.
I wonder whether they intentionally want South Sudan to falter as a nation. This notion becomes relevant when you consider the Dinka Development Plan (DDP) that was unearthed a few years ago. In their fantasy, which is full of tribal chauvinism, the JCE envisaged the Jieng ruling South Sudan for 200 years under Jieng culture. Well, well, well! How would they do it in the presence of the other 63 ethnicities that have got cultures of their own?!
Even the colonialists never came up with such bizarre ideas. We know for a fact that they did help one way or another in the promotion and preservation of our cultures, including the Jieng Culture. For example, the colonialists are the ones who transformed our languages, including the Jieng language from only spoken languages into written ones. They never interfered with our cultural heritage to any significant degree. One can conclude that the regime in Juba is on a path that does not lead to nation building but instead to the dismantling of its very foundations.
