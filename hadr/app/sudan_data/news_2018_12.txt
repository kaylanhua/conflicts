Members of the Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council (RAC) have been released, after being held for raising banners calling for the release of former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal.
Members of theSudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council(RAC) have been released, after being held for raising banners calling for the release of former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal.
Sheikh Hasabelrasoul Nurein and five others were arrested on Saturday whilst protesting against the imprisonment of the leader of the RAC, Musa Hilal. They also held slogans which called for the release of detainees of Hilal’s Mahameed clan.
A relative of the family alleged that the Chief of Security informed detainees that they would be released “after Al Bashir leaves Darfur.”
Al Bashir has been in East and South Darfur for the past four days, during which he promised major projects in development, health and education services. In addition, when addressing a crowd in Adila in East Darfur on the day of the arrests, he confirmed the continuation of theNational Disarmament Campaign; he warned all those hiding weapons that they would be held accountable.
He pointed out that conflict has hindered development in Darfur and called on its residents to maintain security and stability.
Military action
Last weekend, the council, led by the imprisoned militia leader Musa Hilal declared that it wouldlaunch military action to overthrow the regimein Sudan. The statement denounced the financial and health situation in Sudan, as well as the suppression of public opinion and attempts to dismantle camps for displaced people. It also pointed to the Sudanese government and the ruling National Congress Party as responsible parties.
Therefore, the council “officially announces the launch of the military phase to liberate the country from the grip of the ruling gang through revolutionary action and military confrontation with the Khartoum government, which will continue by all means available.”
Imprisoned leader
Sheikh Musa Hilal, known as the former commander of janjaweed forces, was arrested in November 2017 with a group of his aides when he refused to let the affiliated Border Guards forces hand over their weapons to join the paramilitary RSF of Sudan.His trial secretly beganon April 30.
Hilal is held responsible for the atrocities committed in Darfur against civilians after the conflict erupted in 2003. In that year, he was released from prison by the Sudanese government with the purpose to mobilise Darfuri Arab herders to fight the insurgency in the region.
With full government backing, Hilal's militiamen (popularly known as janjaweed)targeted villages of African Darfuris. In January 2014, he announced his defection from the ruling National Congress Party he was then enrolled in, and established the RAC.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Africa (3 December 2018) - Nigeria | ReliefWeb
Nigeria+ 4 more
Key developments in the week of November 25th include the large military operations in Nigeria and Sudan, the insecurity in the DRC and Chad, and the continued government intimidation campaigns launched in Angola.
There were notable military operations in Nigeria and in Sudan last week. In Nigeria, with the February 2019 presidential elections nearing, the government is under increased pressure to tackle insecurity in the country. Last week, the security forces launched new operations against “bandits” and cattle rustler camps in the Mahanga forest in Zamfara state. At least 104 suspects and one police officer were reported killed, 50 hideouts destroyed and over 500 cattle recovered. In Sudan, intermittent clashes between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) branch of the military and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (Abdul Wahid al-Nur Faction) (SLA-AW) continue in southern Jebel Marra. Fighting between the government and SLA-AW escalated in 2018 to pressure the group into joining the national peace process, but whilst contained geographically, the group maintains important operational capabilities. Last week, SLA-AW claimed to have repulsed a 400 men-strong RSF attack on their positions in the Feina area, leaving 18 RSF soldiers killed and another 18 wounded. They also accused the RSF of burning farmlands in the area in retaliation, a practice commonly observed in previous RSF anti-insurgent campaigns. Further fighting is anticipated in the next months as the RSF Commander early November vowed to “crush” the rebels by February 2019.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), security continues to deteriorate, posing a grave threat to the ongoing response to the most severe Ebola outbreak the country has faced and to the holding of free and fair elections at the end of December. In North Kivu, the joint Congolese and MONUSCO operations against rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) continue to face staunch resistance. The ADF is seeking to discredit the government’s response to the threat they pose by repeatedly attacking large towns like Oicha and Beni. On November 26th, the militants killed six people in Oicha town before being repelled by the Congolese troops. On the 30th, their planned attack on Beni town was countered by Congolese and UN soldiers. Violence also rose further north last week, along the shores of Lake Albert in Ituri. At least three soldiers and three civilians were reportedly killed in attacks on military outposts in the Mahagi territory by militiamen from Djugu territory. Organised armed violence in Ituri in 2018 is (so far) 1.5 times higher than in 2017, partly due to the resumption of violence between the Lendu and Hema communities in Djugu territory and to the continued rebellion of the Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri (FRPI) in Irumu.
In Chad, the situation is tense in the Tibesti and Ouaddai regions. In Tibesti, the state forces have been battling armed local self-defence groups in Miski since October 29th, allegedly over contested territorial boundaries and planned gold extraction benefiting the regime of Idriss Deby. Although it remains unclear if these local militias have any links with the rebels of the Military Command Council for the Salvation of the Republic (CCMSR) present in the area, the situation could escalate quickly. The CCMSR has fought the state forces close to Miski on four occasions since August already, and the army has retaliated with airstrikes on villages like Yebbi-Bou, from where the Miski militias are said to have emerged. Violence also rose mid-November between Arab herders and Maba farmers in the Ouara department of Ouaddai, a regular occurrence in the farming region. At least 16 people were reportedly killed in five days of violence in the Chechan area between November 17th-22nd.
Lastly, in Angola, intimidation by the authorities continues in the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province. On November 24th, military and police forces carried out house-to-house raids in the town of Cafunfo, beating some people up, looting their belongings, arresting 700 people unable to present identity cards and expelling around 50 identified as Congolese. The raids came amidst a security crackdown on illegal diamond mining in the province since end September, which escalated into violence early October and resulted in the forced repatriation or fleeing of over 400,000 people, mostly from the DRC. The raids also came a week after the resurgence of the Lunda-Chokwe protectorate movement, whose supporters protested in Cafunfo on November 14th to call for the autonomy of the “Lunda kingdom”. The authorities responded violently to the protest, firing live shots and beating the protesters. The last protests by the group in Lunda Norte on February 24th were similarly repressed, resulting in one fatality.

Title: Proteste gegen Diktatur im Sudan: Das Regime lässt scharf schießen - taz.de
Es begann mit Demos gegen Preiserhöhungen. Aus ihnen wurde ein breiter Protest gegen Langzeitherrscher Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Demonstranten im Sudan: Polizei und Armee gehen gewaltsam gegen sie vorFoto: reuters
NAIROBItaz| Proteste und Streiks lähmen seit einer Woche den Sudan. Es begann mit Demonstrationen gegen die Erhöhung der Preise von Brot und Benzin, aber schnell kam der Ruf, dass Präsident Omar al-Bashir nach 29 Jahren an der Macht zurücktreten soll.
Es gibt im Sudan regelmäßig Proteste gegen die schlechte Wirtschaftslage und die schwierigen Lebensumstände der Bevölkerung. Die Polizei und Armee unterdrücken solche Demonstrationen mit Gewalt, was viele Tote fordert.
Doch die Gewalt jetzt ist größer als sonst. Bis zum 25. Dezember wurden bei ihrer Niederschlagung nach Angaben der Menschenrechtsorganisation Amnesty International 37 Menschen getötet. In den sozialen Medien sind Bilder und Videoaufnahmen zu sehen von Verwundeten und Toten mit Schusswunden. Die USA, Großbritannien, Norwegen und Kanada haben gemeinsam ihre Sorgen geäußert über „glaubwürdige Berichte über Nutzung von scharfer Munition gegen Demonstranten“.
Auch die Dynamik der Proteste ist anders. In der Vergangenheit begannen sie in der Hauptstadt Khartum, aber dieses Mal waren es Arbeiter in der Stadt Atbra, im Osten Sudans, die als erste auf die Straße gingen. Innerhalb von drei Tagen verbreiteten sich die Demonstrationen in großen Teilen des Landes und bis in die Hauptstadt. Politische Analysten glauben, dass der Protest immer mehr Züge eines Volksaufstandes annimmt.
Die Regierung hat Schulen und Universitäten geschlossen und in manchen Städten gilt eine Ausgangssperre. Präsident Bashir hat wirtschaftliche Reformen versprochen. Aber das hat er bisher noch jedes Mal getan, wenn Proteste ausbrachen, jedoch ohne wirklich etwas zu reformieren.
Mit wirtschaftlichen Maßnahmen dürften die Demonstrationen kaum einzudämmen sein. Schon kurz nach ihrem Beginn kam der Ruf nach einem friedlichen Rücktritt der Regierung. Die Büros der Regierungspartei NCP (National Congress Party) wurden Ziele der Demonstranten. „Die Regierungspartei ist nicht nur das Symbol für Tyrannei und Diktatur, sondern auch für die riesige Korruption“, meint Menschenrechtler und Arzt Amgad Fareid Eltayeb, der in England lebt.
Sudans Wirtschaftslage hat sich in jüngster Zeit dramatisch verschlechtert. Seit Präsident Bashir im Jahr 1989 an die Macht kam, war sie nie sehr gesund. Aber als im Jahr 2011, nach Jahrzehnten des Bürgerkrieges, der Südsudan vom Sudan unabhängig wurde, verlor Sudan drei Viertel seiner Ölfelder an Südsudan und damit den Großteil seiner Exporteinnahmen.
Südsudan bezahlt zwar Khartum für den Transport von Öl durch eine Pipeline zum Hafen Port Sudan am Roten Meer, aberder neue Bürgerkrieg im Südsudan, der seit 2013 währt, hat die Ölförderung fast komplett lahmgelegtund Sudans Einnahmen aus dem Transit damit auch. Sudans Auslandsschulden erreichten Ende 2017 56 Milliarden US-Dollar, davon 10 Milliarden an China, und die Regierung kann diese Schulden nicht bedienen.
Um das in die Höhe schnellende Haushaltsdefizit zu decken, wurden vor wenigen Monaten Verbrauchssteuern drastisch erhöht und das sudanesische Pfund abgewertet, sodass viele importierte Güter jetzt viel zu teuer sind für die normale Bevölkerung. Der Großteil der Staatsausgaben aber fließt in den Sicherheitsapparat und das Militär, und viele öffentliche Gelder fließen auf undurchsichtige Weise an Unternehmen im Umfeld des Staatsapparats.
Die Inflation liegt jetzt bei 60 Prozent, in manchen Fällen haben sich die Preise von Grundnahrungsmitteln verdoppelt. Die Wut des Volkes richtet sich auch gegen die Banken, die ungenügend Bargeld besitzen. Geldautomaten geben nur etwa zehn Euro pro Tag aus, wovon kaum eine Familie leben kann. Vielen glauben, dass Parteigenossen Bankkredite ohne Sicherheiten bekommen. „Die Bevölkerung hat ihren Glauben an Banken verloren und bewahrt Geld zu Hause auf“, meint Fareid Eltayeb.
Präsident Bashir gibt die Schuld an der schlechten Wirtschaftslage den USA: Jahrzehntelang stand Sudan unter US-Sanktionen, weil Sudan als Unterstützer des internationalen Terrorismus galt. Osama bin Laden, der ehemalige Führer von al-Qaida, lebte fünf Jahre im Sudan, wo er erfolgreiche Geschäfte machte. Voriges Jahr wurden die Sanktionen zwar beendet, aber die Wirtschaft ist noch immer im freien Fall.
„Die Regierungspartei ist das Symbol für die riesige Korruption“
Deshalb versucht Bashir, die Beziehungen mit ölreichen arabischen Länder zu intensivieren, vor allem mit Saudi-Arabien. Khartum hat Truppen nach Jemen geschickt, um an der Seite der saudisch geführten Koalition dort gegen pro-iranische Rebellen zu kämpfen. Die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate haben mehr als eine Milliarde Euro in Sudans Zentralbank gepumpt.
Doch auch in Bashirs eigenen Reihen wächst die Kritik. Kein Geringerer als Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, besser bekannt als „Hametti“, Leiter der aus den Janjaweed-Terrormilizen im westsudanesischen Darfur hervorgegangenen paramilitärischen Truppe RSF (Rapid Support Forces), hat im Radio jetzt die „korrupte“ Regierung in Khartum kritisiert.
In einer Rede hat Bashir die Bevölkerung vor weiteren Protesten gewarnt. Aber Aktivisten in den sozialen Medien rufen auf zu weiteren nationalen Streiks und friedliche Demonstrationen. Sie wollen diesen Moment nutzen.
Seit der Unabhängigkeit im Jahr 1956 hat es in Sudan selten einen friedlichen Machtwechsel gegeben. Auch Bashir kam durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht. 1989 hatte er den damaligen Präsidenten Sadiq al-Mahdi gestürzt, heute einer der bekanntesten Oppositionsführer des Sudan. Al-Mahdi kam vorige Woche am Mittwoch, gerade als die ersten Proteste anfingen, zurück in die Heimat – nach einem Jahr freiwilligen Exils.

Title: South Sudan’s Kiir, Machar agree to form unity government - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
December 17, 2019 (JUBA) – South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir and the main opposition leader have agreed to form the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) by end of the extended 100 days of pre-transitional period, regardless of the outstanding issues.
Speaking to reporters in Juba on Tuesday, Kiir said he and his arch rival on Tuesday agreed to speed-up the implementation of the security arrangements and establish humanitarian fund to assist the internally displaced persons and the refugees returning voluntarily.
“We said that after 100 days we must form the government of national unity. If the arrangements are not complete, we shall form a transitional government of national unity to implement the outstanding issues,” said Kiir.
“The ceasefire will continue to hold and no one from us is willing to go back to war,” he added.
On his part, however, Machar said they have agreed to fast track the implementation of the security arrangements by moving the forces to the cantonment sites, training and forming a unified army.
The meeting, he told reporters, mainly discussed the security arrangements, funding of the activities of the implementation of the outstanding critical tasks enshrined in the revitalized peace agreement, number of states and their boundaries, engaging of the non-signatories group to peace deal and creating political space.
According to the armed opposition leader, the issue of the states and their boundaries remains pending, but remained optimistic that the matter would be resolved before expiry of the 100 days period.
“The formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU) depends on the progress of the implementation of the outstanding critical issues in the context of the 100 days of the pre-transitional period,” he stressed.
Last month, President Salva Kiir and the country’s main opposition leader Riek Machar agreed to delay key benchmarks in the revitalized peace agreement by additional 100 days.
The delay in forming a transitional national unity government on November 12, 2019 came after Machar’s group raised concerns that the country’s security arrangements are still incomplete.
South Sudan descended into civil war in mid-December 2013 when President Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of plotting a coup, allegations the latter denied.
In September last year, the country’s rival factions signed a revitalized peace deal to end the civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.

Title: الجنجويد السوداني يزور الشبيح السوري - عنب بلدي
إبراهيم العلوش
فاجأ الرئيس السوداني العالم بزيارته إلى سوريا، وإعادته لموشح الصمود والتصدي والمواجهة، وما إلى ذلك من خطابات ممجوجة، تم تكرارها خلال نصف قرن من عهد المخابرات، والاستعراضات العسكرية الكرتونية، ففي يوم الأحد الماضي 16 من كانون الأول، حطت طائرة شحن روسية من نوع “تو 154” وعليها العلم الروسي، في دمشق حاملة زعيم الجنجويد السوداني، ليقابل زعيم الشبيحة السوري، وهي أول زيارة لرئيس عربي إلى دمشق منذ اندلاع الثورة السورية في عام 2011.
تأتي هذه الزيارة في محاولة لإعادة تلزيق النظام العربي القائم، والمبني على بدهيات ثابتة وهي: الرئيس أو الملك القائد التاريخي، ورجل المخابرات مطلق الصلاحيات إلى حدود الوحشية، والأكاذيب المستهلكة في عظمة الأمة وهيبتها التي يبنيها القائد التاريخي وأقاربه ومقربوه!
هذه الزيارة تأتي ضمن محاولة بائسة لإعادة إحياء هذا النظام العربي، الذي مزّقه الربيع العربي، وحطّ من شأنه، وجعل قادته التاريخيين يقبّلون أحذية الدول الأخرى، من أجل أن تساعدهم على البقاء، فقائد الجنجويد السوداني ارتكبت ميليشياته جرائم ضد الإنسانية، وأدت إلى انفصال نصف السودان الجنوبي، من أجل أن يبقى الجنجويد الأول حسن البشير على كرسي السلطة، رغم أنه مطلوب للمحكمة الجنائية الدولية منذ العام 2009.
في نفس الوقت فإن الشبيح الأول هجّر نصف الشعب السوري، وقصف المدن والقرى، ودمّر البنية التحتية، وبيوت الناس، ووقّع معاهدات استعمارية مع الروس، والإيرانيين، منحهم فيها كل ما يريدون من أجل البقاء في السلطة التي ورثها عن أبيه القائد “الخالد”!
هذه القمة بين الاثنين تعبير موجز عن نتائج نصف قرن من ممارسات النظام العربي، وهي تتسم بكل وقاحة الأنظمة العربية، فهذان النظامان حققا أرقامًا قياسية في القهر، والتخريب، والتمزيق بحق بلديهما وشعبيهما. وما هو مشترك بين هذين الاثنين اليوم، هو أن الطائرات الروسية هي التي تتحكم بنقلهم، فبشار الأسد سبق وأن شحنته طائرة روسية إلى سوتشي، لأن بوتين يومها كان مضطرًا لعرضه كدُمية في مؤتمر صحفي، لإثبات هيمنته على القرار السوري أمام مواطنيه الروس، وأمام منافسيه الغربيين.
قنوات النظام وصفحات شبيحته بدأت تغيّر نظام خطابها في احتقار العرب والعروبة، وبدأت تكيل المدائح للرئيس السوداني، وتخطب ودّ الجامعة العربية، علّها تعيد نظام الأسد إلى طاولة خطاباتها، وتسترجع القمم العربية تاريخها مع خطابات بشار الأسد المحشوة بالمصطلحات، وبالسيارات القديمة، وبالسيارات الجديدة، وما إلى ذلك من عبث طفولي بدأه بشار الأسد في خطاباته في القمم العربية، واستكمله بعبث وحشي في تدمير سوريا.
ولعل القمة العربية المقبلة في آذار 2019 في تونس، ستسترجع بشار الأسد ونظامه، وتستمتع بخطابات الأسد المتعلقة بتجربته مع الشعب السوري في المعتقلات، وفي التدمير، وفي الكيماوي، وفي استجرار العروض الروسية والإيرانية لاحتلال البلاد!
مهما كانت نتيجة هذه القمة كخطوة سياسية من قبل الروس، ومن قبل النظام العربي، فإن هذا لن يغير من مصير النظام الذي عرّاه الربيع العربي، وأخرج عوراته إلى العلن، ومهما فعلت الطائرات الروسية من قصف، ومن شحن للرؤساء والمسؤولين العرب والروس إلى دمشق، فإنها لن تقنع أحدًا ببقاء هذا النظام، إلا تحت ظلال الغازات الكيماوية في السماء، وفي الزنزانات المظلمة تحت الأرض، والتي يقبع فيها ربع مليون سوري كرهائن للروس، وللإيرانيين، وللنظام، من أجل ضمان بقائهم في حكم سوريا، وضد إرادة الشعب السوري.
زيارة الجنجويد إلى دمشق مشهد جديد في دراما الإرهاب والتدمير في سوريا، وهي استكمال لمهمة الفريق مصطفى الدابي الذي عمل في دارفور السودانية، وارتكب جرائم ضد الإنسانية، والذي عينته الجامعة العربية مراقبًا في سوريا في كانون الأول 2011، وتم قتل أكثر من ألف سوري أمام أعين مراقبيه، وكان الدابي رمزًا من رموز استمرار القتل في سوريا، وبرضا عربي ودولي يسترجع تجربة السودان في دارفور.
الثورة السورية قامت من أجل رمي هذا النظام، والتخلص من وحشيته ومحاولة الروس وغيرهم إنعاشه، ومده بتجربة دارفور لم تنجح مع الفريق الدابي من قبل، ولن تنجح مع حسن البشير رئيس الجنجويد، فالروس وداعموه يهدرون الزمن والطاقات من أجل إحياء هذا النظام الذي تنبعث روائح موته الواخزة، ولن تنفع عطور العالم بمحو رائحة جثته المتعفنة، هذا النظام لن تكتب له الحياة من جديد، فهل يفهم الروس والإيرانيون ذلك، أم إنهم لا يريدون إلا التعلّق بالوهم، والاستمرار بتجاهل إرادة الشعب السوري!

Title: Mourners protest RSF killing man in North Kordofan - Dabanga Radio TV Online

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The funeral of a man shot dead by Rapid Support Forces members in North Kordofan turned into a protest by mourners on Thursday. The state police chief and the area’s RSF commander promised an investigation into the killing.
The funeral of a man shot dead by Rapid Support Forces members in North Kordofan turned into a protest by mourners on Thursday. The state police chief and the area's RSF commander promised an investigation into the killing.
Members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) shot cattle merchant Adam Ibrahim in their attempt to rob him in block 9 of Sheikan district in El Obeid city on Wednesday night. The merchant was killed on the spot.
Ibrahim's funeral the next day turned into a protest by mourners. They chanted slogans against the atrocities committed by the RSF.
A relative of the deceased, who belongs to the Misseriya tribe, explained that Ibrahim had came from Lagawa to sell his cattle in El Obeid market. He demanded that the perpetrators be arrested and brought to trial.
People made demands for the RSF to be removed from the area, making threats in the events that the paramilitary forces were not relocated from El Obeid and the surrounding areas.
The North Kordofan state police chief addressed the protesting mourners on Thursday, describing the incident as “unfortunate”. He announced that the police had arrested three suspects and promised to arrest the other three suspects.
He also announced the formation of a joint security committee to deter the security chaos and resolve the issue of motorcycles that go without number plates. These are regularly used by militiamen or outlaws in criminal acts such as robberies.
In his comments, the area's RSF commander said they are against insecurity in the state. He promised that the perpetrators would be brought to an urgent trial.
The incident was the fourth at El Zariba preceded by three incidents in which members of the RSF were involved. In total, a large sum of money has been stolen from traders who rejected the presence of the paramilitary force in the area, under the pretext of the RSF having become a source of threat and intimidation for the residents and traders.

A televised interview with the main RSF commander Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan (also known as Hemeti) in October was quickly banned after Hamdan said that the Governor of North Kordofan should be in jail for “bringing us into disrepute”. The TV programme itselfhas been suspended.
Tensions between the RSF and North Kordofan population started years ago, when the residents of El Obeid took part in a mass demonstration, demanding the expulsion of the RSF which had allegedly carried out acts of murder, rape, and theft against the residents of the state.
At the time, Governor Ahmed Haroun issued a statement in which he apologised to the residents and issued a decision to expel them from the state, which the majority of them were in February 2014. They were re-stationed in Darfur, reportedly to fight rebel groups.
Ever since the paramilitary forces have been accountable for widespread systematic crimes against civilians, constituting ‘egregious crimes’against humanity and war crimes, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published in the report 'Men with no Mercy'.

Title: How Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir stays in power | CNN
PresidentOmar al-Bashirwas addressing his top police officers on Sunday following days of unrest across Sudan. In a video disseminated by the state news agency SUNA, his words sounded remarkably conciliatory.
“It is the duty of the state to maintain security without abuse, and to implement internal security principles using the least possible force,” Bashir told his officers. “The purpose is not to kill the people but the ultimate goal is to maintain the security and stability for the citizens.”
The feed, provided by SUNA, cut off there, but Bashir’s speech wasn’t over.
In a video captured by the Turkish news agency Anadolu and currently making the rounds on Sudanese social media, he continued: “but sometimes – as we said and as God himself said – you have, in the exacting of penance, life. What is exacting penance? It is killing, it is execution, but God described it as life because it is a deterrence to others so we can maintain security.” At the conclusion of his address, the President and his officers began to dance.

But in Bashir’s Sudan, executions are often a “deterrence” enacted without recourse to judge or jury. In the days since anti-government demonstrations began rippling across the country, there have been reports of dozens killed and hundreds more wounded. The fear is now that this toll is set to rise.
Bashir’s speech was taken as asign by protesters that he had declared open seasonon them on the eve of mass protests in the capital Khartoum on Monday.
At least 21 activists were released after being arrested in Khartoum for participating in Monday’s demonstrations, a local journalist told CNN. While the total number of arrests remains unclear, activists report that more than 300 protesters were arrested.
The tactics and the language are not new. Bashir’s plain-spoken colloquialisms, backed by recitations from the Quran as justification, are almost as famous as the Arab tribal dances he routinely does with his cane aloft at rallies across the country. They harken back to the early days of his regime, after he came to power in a military coup backed by Islamists in 1989, when he portrayed himself as a man of the people, if one not exactly chosen by them.
In the first few years, Bashir ordered the interrogations and detentions of his opponents, real and imagined, in infamous “ghost houses,” where dissidents were tortured. He also reinforced his rule through the forced recruitment of northern Sudanese boys as he waged war against the country’s south, portraying it as an existential battle for the Muslims of Arab descent in the north.
As different conflicts erupted across the country throughout his rule – Darfur, South Kordofan, Blue Nile – Bashir became increasingly worried that his army could not be trusted to back him. Its ranks were filled with boys and men from historically marginalized regions, where Bashir’s Arab-centric imagery and tribal leader self-mythologizing rang hollow.
So Bashir began to rebuild.
A new paramilitary group, known as the Rapid Support Force, was created out of the remnants of the Janjaweed tribal militias in Darfur. Their leader, Mohammed Hamdan “Hamadti,” was made an adviser to the President, in spite of accusations of his involvement in atrocities in Darfur.
Elite units known as “Abu Tayra” were added to the police force. The country’s national security agency also gained a special forces unit under the aegis of Sudan’s commander in chief – Field Marshal Omar al-Bashir.
Related articleSudan's leader has avoided major public unrest for years -- but that could be about to change
These newly built units were more directly controlled by Bashir than traditional law enforcement agencies, and largely consisted of young men from tribes of Arab descent, playing directly in to Bashir’s policy of tribally dividing and conquering.
This policy has been reinforced in recent days by the parading across state television of Darfuri students of non-Arab descent, accused of being “the foreign agents” responsible for the demonstrations and unrest.
All of this has now been unleashed against the demonstrators currently challenging his rule, with a few added extras – the snipers and the “ghost squads,” young men in plain clothes patrolling the streets in government issued pick-up trucks.
Eyewitnesses described beatings and detentions by these men, along with the helplessness of not knowing who to hold accountable or who to blame. Others described seeing plain-clothed snipers stationed on buildings along protest routes in towns across Sudan. One even found a sniper stationed on the roof of his office building, without his knowledge.
The marches, for now though, continue. All ages and all professions are out in the streets, united with one call: it’s time for Bashir to go.

Title: Saudi Arabia recruited Darfur children to fight in Yemen: NYT | News | Al Jazeera
Riyadh offered child survivors from Sudan’s bloody Darfur conflict as much as $10,000 to fight in Yemen, says the NYT.
Saudi Arabiarecruited children fromSudan‘s conflict-ravaged Darfur region to fight on the front lines inYemen, the New York Times hasreported.
The kingdom offered desperate Sudanese families as much as $10,000 to enlist their children to fight in the nearly four-year-old war against Iran-alignedHouthirebels, the NYT said on Friday.
Led by Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia, along with theUnited Arab Emirates, intervened in Yemen in 2015 in support of the internationally recognised President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Sudan joined the Saudi-led alliance, deploying thousands of ground troops to Yemen.
Five Sudanese fighters who had returned from Yemen told the NYT that children made up 20-40 percent of their units in Yemen.
Many of the child soldiers were aged 14 to 17, the report said, and were often sent off to war by their parents, some of whom were so eager for money that they bribed officers of the Sudanese units in Yemen to let their sons go to fight.
“Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money,” Hager Shomo Ahmed, whowas recruited to fight in Yemen in 2016 when he was just 14,told the NYT.




At any time in the past four years, as many as 14,000 Sudanese people have been fighting in the Gulf country alongside Yemeni-armed groups backed by the Saudis, the newspaper said, quoting returnees as well as Sudanese legislators.
The NYT report said almost all of the Sudanese fighters apparently come from the impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum in 2003.
Most of them belonged to the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group known as Janjaweed, which was blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes.
The fighters told the NYT that while in Yemen, the Saudi and Emirati commanders overseeing the Sudanese units ordered them almost exclusively by remote control so that they could keep a safe distance from the battle lines.
“They never fought with us,” Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil said.
A 25-year-old fighter, identified as Ahmed, told the newspaper: “They treat the Sudanese like their firewood.”
Hundreds of Sudanese fighters have been killed in Yemen, according to the report.
A spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition denied recruiting Sudanese children in a statement to the newspaper, labelling the allegations “fictitious and unfounded”.
The NYT said Babikir Elsiddig Elamin, a spokesman for Sudan’s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on troop levels, casualties or paychecks in Yemen. He told the newspaper that Sudan was fighting “in the interest of regional peace and stability”.
The Sudanese ground troops have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war in Yemen, by insulating them from casualties that might test the patience of families at home, the NYT said.
The war in Yemen has killed more than 60,000 people, according to the war monitor Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, and has pushed the already impoverished country to the verge of famine.
According to theUnited Nations, the conflict has triggered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

November 26, 2019 (KHARTOUM/JUBA) – Sudan’s Follow-up Committee for the Implementation of the 100-Day Agreement Monday affirmed the seriousness of the South Sudanese parties in implementing the Entebbe Agreement on the enforcement of critical tasks in the revitalized peace agreement.
A Sudanese delegation including members of the Sovereign Council and the government was in Juba for talks with the South Sudanese peace parties on their plans for the first 50 days to ensure the implementation of the security arrangements and the number and boundaries of the 28 states.
The delegation was composed of Mohamed Hamdan Daglo (Hemetti), Aisha Musa, Yasir al-Atta, Mohamed Hassan Eltaishi, and Mohamed al-Faki, as well as the Minister of the Federal Government Youssef Adam Aldai.
They met with President Salva Kiir, and the military and political committees tasked with the implementation of the pre-transitional arrangements.
Following the meetings, Eltaishi stated that the two parties reaffirmed their seriousness to overcome the logistical and technical difficulties that face the implementation of critical tasks.
“We have seen, from the government and the opposition, a serious desire to implement what has been agreed upon,” he said.
The Sudanese official further stressed that there is no political difference on the agenda of security arrangements, but some logistical and technical difficulties related to the timetable for the implementation of security arrangements particularly placing troops in cantonment sites and start training.
“Though 13 of the 100 days have elapsed, the parties could have accomplished important steps during this period. But we were briefed on a matrix linked to specific schedules and budget and specific cantonment sites for training and redeployment,” he stressed.
In a separate statement made immediately after the meeting with President Kiir, Hemetti told reporters that there will be a Sudanese military committee to follow up the cantonment sites and the training camps.
He further said that the Follow-up Committee will discuss with the political leadership any problems that may emerge during the upcoming days based on the reports made by the military experts.
South Sudanese Presidential Adviser on Security Affairs Tut Kew Gatluak, for his part, welcomed the visit of the Sudanese delegation saying it confirms Sudan’s interest in the peace process in South Sudan.
In a tripartite meeting on 7 November gathering Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, head of Sudanese Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, South Sudan’s President and his main peace partner Riek Machar agreed to extend the pre-transitional period for 100 days and to form a mechanism to oversee the implementation of the security arrangements and to determine the states’ number and boundaries.
In a statement issued on Friday 22 November, the Security Council said disappointed by the of the transitional national unity government.
Further, the Council called on the Guarantors and Parties of the Agreement to “quickly operationalize the mechanism and set out clearly how it will operate in coordination with the existing mechanisms and institutions of the Agreement, as well as stakeholders to the South Sudan peace process”.

Title: NUP Deputy-Head held while hanging posters in Khartoum - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The co-deputy head of the opposition National Umma Party (NUP) was detained in Khartoum on Thursday while hanging posters announcing the imminent return to Sudan of NUP Chairman El Sadig El Mahdi.
The co-deputy head of the opposition National Umma Party (NUP) was detained in Khartoum on Thursday while hanging posters announcing the imminent return to Sudan of NUP Chairman El Sadig El Mahdi.
In a statement on Friday, the NUP said that Bashir Hamid was detained in El Kalakla district in southern Khartoum by agents of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).
The statement asserts that Hamid’s detention is “one of the indicators of blocking the return of El Mahdi”.
It added that the security authorities released Hamid late on Thursday night. He was summoned to return to the security offices on Friday morning.
The statement rejected what it called “gross violation of human rights and the targeting of the party, its leaders and cadres in the series of harassment and pressures that are still practised by the regime.”
Exile
El Mahdi was abroad in a self-imposed exile until early 2017, when he returnedto the Sudanese capital. He left had Sudan in August 2014 after having been detained for one month.
He was accused by the NISS of undermining the Constitution. El Mahdi had denounced the widespread attacks against civilians in Kordofan and Darfur by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commanded by the NISS.
Capital charges
In April this year, following El Mahdi’s election as chairman of the Sudan Call alliance, the State Security Prosecution service in Sudan instructed acomplaint be filed against El Mahdi, “for dealing and coordinating with rebel armed movements to overthrow the regime.”
The Sudanese Security Services Centre said the move came after the NISS submitted a petition to the State Security Prosecution against El Sadig El Mahdi and others.
The NISS was responding tothreats of legal actionagainst the alliance made by Sudan’s President Omar Al Bashir since the conclusion ofmeetings of the Sudan Call in Paris in March.
The NISS said that the High Prosecutor General Advisor Motasim Abdallah filed charges on sabotaging of the constitutional order, staging war, calling for opposition to the public authority by violence, and spying on the country, which is punishable by death, in addition to articles 5 and 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
In July this year the authorities at Cairo International Airport denied El Sadig El Mahdi access to Egypt after he returned from Germany. The German government had invited the leaders of the Sudan Call, a coalition of Sudanese opposition parties and armed movements, to discuss a proposal to solve the peace talks impasse.
AUHIP
A meeting is scheduled between theSudan Call alliance and the AU High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) led by Thabo Mbeki will be held in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa todayto discuss the National Dialogue issue.

Title: Facebook accused of silencing Vietnam bloggers – DW – 12/15/2018
Facebook is being used to silence bloggers critical of Vietnam's government, according to Reporters Without Borders. The campaigners said there were 26 imprisoned media workers in the Southeast Asian nation.
The media campaigners Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Vietnamese bloggers living in exile were being censored because of the misuse of a safety feature on Facebook.
RSF said the social network deleted posts and blocked accounts because of alleged violations of community standards.
"Our research shows that the Vietnamese government is apparently abusing digital space to suppress critical voices abroad as well," said RSF managing director Christian Mihr. "Those responsible must stop these attacks and respect the freedom of the press.
Bui Thanh Hieu, a Vietnamese blogger granted political asylum in Germany, was one of those concerned, according to RSF. He writes about social ills in his home country and his Facebook-distributed writings are hugely popular in Vietnam, but he has been repeatedly banned since January.
Hieu was banned from Facebook in October as a "repeat offender" after images from his account were copied and uploaded to other accounts. Those account holders then accused Hieu of copyright infringements.

'Malicious attack'
Vietnamese journalist Trung Khoa Le has lived in Germany since 1993. He runs the online news site Thoibao.de or "Time." He was prevented from publishing a video critical of Vietnam's communist government by a block on his account. Facebook has since admitted there was a "malicious attack" and made some changes.
RSF said there were more than 20 similar cases of writers being silenced.

Activists in Vietnam also targeted
Blogger and activist Do Cong Duong was given a five-year jail sentence in September on a charge of "abusing democratic freedom." This came just weeks after he was given a four-year sentence for "disturbing public order."
Duong was arrested for posting articles and video reports about land rights and evictions. The most vulnerable sectors of Vietnam's population are concerned, due to rapid urbanization in Vietnam, reported RSF.
Vietnamese activist and blogger Huynh Thuc Vy was sentenced to nearly three years in jail last month. Vy, who is pregnant with her second child, was convicted for smearing white paint on the national flag.

Respect press freedom
Media outlets in Vietnam are strictly censored. People who openly write about workers' protests, land grabs or corruption among high-ranking politicians face persecution and prison.
According to RSF, there are at least 26 imprisoned media workers in Vietnam, where authorities target citizen journalists in particular. On the NGO'sWorld Press Freedom Index, Vietnam ranks 175th out of 180 countries.

Title: نيويورك تايمز: السعودية جندت أطفالا من دارفور للقتال في خطوط النار باليمن – اليوم 24
قالت صحيفة « نيويورك تايمز »، الأمريكية، إن السعودية استخدمت ثروتها النفطية، الهائلة، لتجنيد آلاف من الناجين، اليائسين من الصراع في دارفور، غربي السودان، للقتال في اليمن، تصل نسبة الأطفال بينهم إلى 40 في المائة.
وأضافت الصحيفة، في تقرير لها من الخرطوم، أن أعمار الأطفال المجندين ما بين الرابعة عشر، والسابعة عشر، مشيرة إلى أنه، منذ أربع سنوات، يقاتل في اليمن نحو 14 ألفا من أفراد مليشيات سودانية، قتل منهم المئات.
وتشير الصحيفة في التقرير، الذي نشر أول أمس، إلى أن معظم هؤلاء ينتمون إلى مليشيا الجنجويد، المتهمة بارتكاب جرائم فضيعة في إقليم دارفور السوداني.
وجاء في التقرير نفسه أن بعض الأهالي، التواقين إل المال، يرشون قادة المليشيات في دارفور للسماح لأبنائهم بالذهاب إلى القتال في اليمن.
ويكشف تقرير « نيويورك تايمز » أن المبالغ لتجنيد هؤلاء الأطفال تتراوح بين 480 دولارا لولد في الـ14 من العمر، و530 دولارا إذا كان ضابطا من الجنجويد.

وبحسب التقرير نفسه، فإنه إذا اشتد القتال يعلو السعر، فيُدفع بدل احتدام معركة مبلغ أقصاه 280 دولارا، وكل ستة أشهر تُدفع مكافأة عشرة آلاف دولار.
ويقول تحقيق « نيويورك تايمز » إن عائلة أحد المقاتلين تقاضت 35 ألف دولار بدلا عن حياته عندما قُتل.
وكان المتحدث باسم التحالف السعودي/ الإماراتي قد نفى، سابقا، تجنيد أطفال للقتال في الحرب باليمن.
يذكر أنه بالإضافة إلى المليشيات، ينتشر مئات من الجنود السودانيين في اليمن في إطار التحالف السعودي الإماراتي ضد المتمردين الحوثيين، وحلفائهم من أنصار الرئيس الراحل، علي عبد الله صالح.
وأكدت الخرطوم، على لسان وزير دفاعها، الفريق أول ركن عوض محمد أحمد بن عوف، في وقت سابق، إصرار الحكومة على إبقاء جنودها في اليمن، معتبرا أن ذلك « واجب، والتزام أخلاقي ».
كما ارتفعت أصوات سودانية، عبر البرلمان، منادية بإعادة القوات السودانية من اليمن، بعدما لم يعد مبرر لوجودها هناك، وخسارة مجموعة من الجنود في مواجهات مع الحوثيين.

Title: Sudan ruling party demands investigation into killings of anti-government protesters 
One of Sudan's ruling parties has demanded an inquest into the killing of anti-government protesters amid mounting pressure on long-serving dictator Omar Bashir to resign.
Idris Suleman, a senior member of the Islamist Popular Congress Party, said on Wednesday that his party's reports indicated that 17 people have been "martyred" and 88 wounded in the protests that have swept the country over the past week.
"We call on the government to launch an investigation into the killings," Mr Suleman said at a press conference in Khartoum. "Those who committed these killings must be held accountable."
Protests against rising prices and shortages of food and fuel first broke out in the city of Atabara on December 19, and rapidly spread to other cities and escalated into demands that Bashir step down.
Several protests have ended in violent crackdowns by security services.
The Popular Congress Party is a member of Mr Bashir's government and its previous leader played a key role in putting Mr Bashir in power in a military coup in 1989.
Mr Suleman's intervention came a day after a senior Sudanese military commander appeared to endorse the protests.
Mohammed Hamdan Dagolo, who commands a para-military unit called the Rapid Support Forces, was filmed on Tuesday telling several thousand troops that they should show "solidarity" with the Sudanese people and that the government is to blame for the inflation that sparked nation-wide protests last week.
Gen Dagolo is a former commander of the Janjaweed militia who took part in the genocide in Darfur.
Mr Bashir, who has ruled Sudan for 29 years, on Tuesday said he would defy calls to resign and suggested demonstratorswho took to the streets over spiraling food pricesare directed by foreign powers.
"You are the ones responding to them right now. From here, you are responding to all the traitors and foreign agents. I support you. And with your support, I will be back here next year," he told supporters at a rally south of Khartoum on Tuesday.
Security forces used teargas and fired rifles in the air to disperse protesters attempting to march on the presidential palace in Khartoum to demand the resignation of Bashir on Tuesday.
Organizers claimed police also used live rounds and that eight people had suffered gunshot wounds. The claim could not be immediately verified.
A further protester was reported to have died of his wounds after being shot in the head in the city of Gadaref earlier in the week, protest leaders said.
Video purporting to show hundreds of people on the streets chanting the "people want to bring down the regime," a slogan from the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, emerged from Khartoum on Tuesday afternoon.
The march, which was organised by a coalition of trade unions and the country's two biggest opposition parties, was meant to to present a petition at the presidential palace demanding Bashir stand aside for a "transitional government of technocrats."
There was a heavy security presence in Khartoum on Wednesday but no further protests.
Sudanese officials have said at least 12 people have died since the beginning of the protests. Amnesty International said on Monday that it had received "credible" reports that 37 people had been killed by security forces since protests began.
The United States, Britain, Norway and Canada said in a joint statement on Monday that they were concerned by reports security forces have used live ammunition.
Bashir, 74,  has ruled Sudan since he seized power from an elected but ineffectual government in a military coup in 1989.
He has been accused of multiple human rights abuses, including directing the killing of civilians in Darfur in the 2000s, and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague on multiple charges war crimes and genocide.

Title: No one should lose their life for the price of a loaf of bread | The National
Editorial
26 December, 2018
A loaf of bread costs 3 pounds, or 23 fils, in Sudan. That might sound like small change but last week it tripled from 7 fils, severely crippling a population where half earn less than $2 a day and prompting nationwide protests, in which an estimated 37 people have been shot dead by government forces. For seven days,demonstrations against the rising prices of commodities and fuel shortages have been met with live ammunition. The protests threaten to turn more violent still after the military vowed to back president Omar Al Bashir and moved troops to Khartoum, amid calls from some quarters for Mr Al Bashir to step down.
A potentially explosive situation is brewing. Mr Al Bashir, who took over in a military coup in 1989, is seeking a constitutional amendment which will allow him to run in the 2020 presidential election. Meanwhile his main challenger Sadiq Al Mahdi, toppled by the coup and newly returned to Sudan after a period in exile, hasblamed "armed repression" for the deaths. This volatile cocktail of eventsthreatens to spill into more violence, with Mr Al Bashir, a man accused of war crimes, crushing opposition with force during unrest earlier this year. Continuing human rights abuses have raised concerns among the international community, particularly those carried out by the government-protected Janjaweed militia, a law unto themselves in Darfur.
Sudan's current economic woes were partly fuelled by the 2011 secession of South Sudan, when it lost three-quarters of its oil reserves. Inflation is among the world's highest at 69 per cent. Yet much has been achieved in recent months.One of Barack Obama's last acts in office was to revoke economic sanctions against Sudan after 20 years of hardshipbecause of a marked scaling down in military aggression, the opening of humanitarian corridors to famine-affected areas of South Sudan and increased co-operation with the US in counter-terrorism. Donald Trump went further still in October last year by dismantling trade and economic embargos. The UK has also been investigating the possibility of investment and trade after Brexit, a move which would bolster the flagging economy. Meanwhile the 2016 Khartoum Process has been working since 2016 to address migration and human trafficking. There is a danger the hard work could be undone by Mr Al Bashir's authoritarianism and the violent response to protests. Moreover, corruption is endemic, with Sudan faring worse globally than Libya and North Korea. Mr Al Bashir has introduced reforms but they have done little to curb the economic crisis and discontent is rife. Faith must be restored in the nation's democratic institutions, the economy stabilised and, crucially, Sudan must have good governance and systems in place for people to air their grievances – because no one should lose their life for the price of a loaf of bread.

Plural news and views on Sudan
December 9, 2019 (JUBA) – The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has expressed concerns over the recent clashes in the country, days after it deployed peacekeepers to end violence in Western Lakes state.
Over the weekend, a fresh outbreak of tribal clashes and other internal fighting reportedly resulted in the death and displacement of civilians in the central and northern regions of the war-torn nation.
“These clashes in areas that have been relatively calm for many months is worrying,” remarked David Shearer, the head of UNMISS.
“The parties in South Sudan have respected the ceasefire signed in 2018 but these intercommunal incidents raise tensions and increase the risk of sparking more serious violence,” he added.
The UN official said shortage of food and access to basic services in the wake of the civil war has put huge pressure on communities.
“The recent flooding has worsened this situation by destroying crops and pasture which will have a long-term impact on food availability in the coming months,” noted Shearer.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), nearly a million people have been affected by heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding, of whom 620,000 need humanitarian assistance.
In October, the South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency in the flood-affected areas of the country.
“It is vital that people do not turn to violence as a solution to the dire economic situation or because of political uncertainty. Reconciliation and peace-building is the only viable path to development and, ultimately, prosperity for all South Sudanese,” he added.
Over the weekend, UNMISS said it received reports of clashes over supplies being transported by barge near Jikou, in Upper Nile.
Humanitarian workers, it added, were relocated out of the area for their own safety.
In a separate incident, there were reports of internal fighting within the ranks of an armed group in north-western Unity region.
Meanwhile, there were other intercommunal clashes in the Lakes region. On 8 December, fighting reportedly broke out between the Rup and Pakam communities with incidents of cattle-raiding and revenge attacks taking place six kilometers south-east of Rumbek.
There has also been fighting reported in Cuetakuet Island, which is a disputed area located on the Nile about 145 kilometers north of Bor.
The number of casualties from these incidents is yet to be verified.
UNMISS, however, said it is working with authorities at the local and national level to resolve these disputes and will continue to support reconciliation and peace-building among affected communities.

Title:  On the front line of the Saudi War in Yemen? Child soldiers from Darfur | World News - The Indian Express
By David D. Kirkpatrick
The civil war in Darfur robbed Hager Shomo Ahmed of almost any hope. Raiders had stolen his family’s cattle, and a dozen years of bloodshed had left his parents destitute.
Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.
Hager, 14 at the time, could not find Yemen on a map, and his mother was appalled. He had survived one horrific civil war — how could his parents toss him into another? But the family overruled her.
“Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money,” Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.
The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. An intermittent blockade by the Saudis and their partners in the United Arab Emirates has pushed as many 12 million people to the brink of starvation, killing some 85,000 children, according to aid groups.
Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.
At any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.
Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.
Most belong to paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur’s conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen — albeit in a more formal and structured campaign.
Some families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.
To keep a safe distance from the battle lines, their Saudi or Emirati overseers commanded the Sudanese fighters almost exclusively by remote control, directing them to attack or retreat through radio headsets and GPS systems provided to the Sudanese officers in charge of each unit, the fighters all said.
“The Saudis told us what to do through the telephones and devices,” said Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil, a 28-year-old member of the Bani Hussein tribe who returned from Yemen at the end of last year. “They never fought with us.”
“The Saudis would give us a phone call and then pull back,” agreed Ahmed, 25, a member of the Awlad Zeid tribe who fought near Hodeida this year and who did not want his full name published for fear of government retaliation. “They treat the Sudanese like their firewood.”
A few thousand Emiratis are based around the port of Aden. But the rest of the coalition the Saudis and Emiratis have assembled is united mainly by dependence on their financial aid.
The Pakistani military, despite a parliamentary vote blocking its participation, has quietly dispatched 1,000 soldiers to bolster Saudi forces inside the kingdom. Jordan has deployed jets and military advisers. Both governments rely heavily on aid from the Gulf monarchies. (A report by a U.N. panel suggested Eritrea may have sent about 400 troops as well.)
But in Sudan, which has played a far larger role, the Saudi money appears to flow directly to the fighters — or mercenaries, as critics call them. It benefits the economy only indirectly.
“People are desperate. They are fighting in Yemen because they know that in Sudan they don’t have a future,” said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, a former banker, economic consultant and critic of the government. “We are exporting soldiers to fight like they are a commodity we are exchanging for foreign currency.”
A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including “abstaining from child recruitment.”
“The allegations that there are children among the ranks of the Sudanese forces are fictitious and unfounded,” spokesman Turki al-Malki said in the statement. Saudi officials said their soldiers have also died in Yemen, but declined to disclose how many.
The Sudanese ground troops unquestionably have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war. The Sudanese have insulated the Saudis and Emiratis from the casualties that might test the patience of families at home.
The Sudanese are sometimes deployed to defend the flanks of the Yemeni militiamen who spearhead attacks. But the Sudanese fighters insist they are also the main barrier against the Saudis’ Yemeni foes, the Houthis.
“Without us, the Houthis would take all of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca,” Fadil said.
Ambassador Babikir Elsiddig Elamin, a spokesman for Sudan’s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on troop levels, casualties or paychecks in Yemen. He said that Sudan was fighting “in the interest of regional peace and stability.”
“Other than that,” he added, “we don’t have any national interest in Yemen.”
Sudan’s defense minister threatened in May to withdraw from the conflict, pointedly announcing that Khartoum was “reassessing” participation in light of Sudan’s “stability and interests.” Diplomats called the statement a veiled demand that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide more financial assistance.
They did not, and the Sudanese economy teetered.
Khartoum backed down. The flow of fighters continued.
President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has gained valuable allies, easing his international isolation after years as a virtual pariah.
The United States has designated Bashir’s government a state sponsor of terrorism for more than two decades. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for his arrest, charging him with directing the Darfur war crimes.
Until recently, the Saudis and Emirates kept their distance, suspicious of Bashir’s roots in political Islam and relations with Iran and Qatar, both Saudi rivals.
The war in Yemen, however, has enabled Bashir to win at least diplomatic support from its Gulf leaders, and he has thanked the Saudis and Emiratis for pressing Washington to upgrade relations.
The Saudi payments to the soldiers, meanwhile, have become increasingly significant to Sudan, where inflation has hit 70 percent and even in the capital residents line up for bread, fuel and bank withdrawals. At least nine people have been killed this month by security forces.
Darfur has furnished mercenaries to other conflicts as well.
Rebel groups who fought the Janjaweed have turned up fighting in Libya for the anti-Islamist Gen. Khalifa Hifter, according to the findings of a UN panel and other reports.
But far more have fought in Yemen.
The five fighters who had returned from Yemen and two brothers of fighters who died there all gave similar accounts. Sudanese jets departed Khartoum or Nyala, Darfur, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers at a time to Saudi Arabia.
They were delivered to camps inside the kingdom, where some said they saw as many as 8,000 Sudanese gathered.
The Saudis issued them uniforms and weapons, which the Sudanese fighters believed were U.S.-made. Then Saudi officers provided two to four weeks of training, mainly in assembling and cleaning their guns.
Finally, they were divided into units of 500 to 750 fighters, they said. Then they traveled over land to Yemen, to battles in the Midi Desert, the Khalid ibn Walid camp in Taiz, or around Aden and Hodeida.
All said they fought only for money. They were paid in Saudi riyals, the equivalent of about $480 a month for a 14-year-old novice to about $530 a month for an experienced Janjaweed officer. They received an additional $185 to $285 for any month they saw combat — every month for some.
Their payments were deposited directly into the Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan, partly owned by Saudis. At the end of a six-month rotation, each fighter also received a one-time payment of at least 700,000 Sudanese pounds — roughly $10,000 at the current official exchange rate.
By comparison, a Sudanese doctor working overtime at multiple jobs might earn the equivalent of $500 a month, said Mohamed, the economic consultant.
Abdul Raheem, 32, a member of the Rezeigat tribe whose full name was withheld to prevent reprisals, said that last year his family paid a local militia leader a bribe worth $1,360 so an older brother could go to Yemen as an officer.
The brother, Abdul Rahman, died in combat in February. “Life is like that,” Abdel Raheem said, stone-faced.
Abdul Rahman’s wife and three children received the equivalent of $35,000 in Sudanese pounds, although banking restrictions have hindered access to it.
Some Sudanese officers had told the soldiers explicitly, “Don’t fight harder than the money is worth, don’t fight more than you are paid for,” recalled Ahmed, of the Awlad Zeid tribe.
All the fighters complained of Houthi rockets and mines, and they recounted casualty levels ranging from 135 in Fadil’s unit to about 200 in Ahmed’s. When they returned they bought livestock, a Korean-made pickup truck or a small grocery store.
Hager, who went to Yemen at 14 and returned in November 2017, wore a matching khaki shirt and pants to an interview in Khartoum. His cheeks were clean. His mustache was just beginning.
His unit lost 20 men during their overland journey to a camp near Aden, where they lost 22 more in a first battle and 35 in a second — 180 after six months.
He had been terrified every day, he said, hunching forward in his seat when he talked about combat. But his Sudanese officers let him call his parents from time to time, and now they are happy. Besides a house, he bought the family 10 cattle.
Lou Vincent, a former cricketer banned for match-fixing, was honored by Sir Richard Hadlee for his achievements in 100 ODIs.

Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.
'Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money,' Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.
Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.
Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.
ome families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.
As many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen at any given time for nearly four years. Hundreds, at least, have died.

'They never fought with us.'
A few thousand Emiratis are based around the port of Aden. But the rest of the coalition the Saudis and Emiratis have assembled is united mainly by dependence on their financial aid.
But in Sudan, which has played a far larger role, the Saudi money appears to flow directly to the fighters — or mercenaries, as critics call them. It benefits the economy only indirectly.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including 'abstaining from child recruitment.'
The Sudanese ground troops unquestionably have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war. The Sudanese have insulated the Saudis and Emiratis from the casualties that might test the patience of families at home.
'Without us, the Houthis would take all of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca,' Mr. Fadil said.

They did not, and the Sudanese economy teetered.
