The North Darfur authorities have ordered the withdrawal of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces from Saraf Omra locality.
Reasons were not provided, a listener told Radio Dabanga from the area on Sunday. He said that the people living in the locality are concerned that “The pull-out might cause chaos to prevail again”.
Other sources reported a visit by the RSF second commander, Maj. Gen. Abdelrahim Dagalo, to a number of places in the locality.
They said the visit coincided with reports about the distribution of military ranks and weapons to members of Arab tribes in these places, and the demarcation of land for each of these tribes, where model villages are said to be built.
Saraf Omra has been one of the strongholds of former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal, who was detained together with dozens of his militiamen in North Darfur’s Misteriyain end November.
The Sudanese government has deployed the RSF, its main militia, to implement a nationwide disarmament campaignannounced in July. The collection of illicit weapons and unlicensed vehicles started in Darfur, and South and West Kordofan in August.

South Sudanese government spokesperson Michael Makuei Lueth (Photo ST)September 22, 2018 (JUBA) – The South Sudanese government spokesperson Minister Michael Makuei said the international community should provide the needed funds for the implementation of the revitalized agreement they want it to be implemented.
The Troika countries, the United Kingdom, United States, and Norway said voiced scepticism about the parties’ level of commitment to the agreement and said before to support the implementation process they need to see a significant change in the parties’ approach.
In a statement the VOA, Minister Makuei reiterated his government commitment to the signed agreement and pointed out that the implementation process needs international financial support.
“If they want the agreement implemented, they are supposed to join us in the implementation so that we all work together,” he said before to add that “implementation means money. It means funding.”
Regional officials say that the international community will continue to fund the process but would be this time more strict and request tangible progress during the 30-month transitional period.
On 18 September, the head of UN peacekeeping department and the outgoing UN Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan urged the international community to provide the needed support ensure the implementation of the IGAD-brokered deal.
UN envoy Nicholas Haysom further said the IGAD has to “demonstrate a commitment to make the agreement work” and to confront the peace spoilers even it is the South Sudanese government.
The IGAD is blamed for remaining silent while the reports of the ceasefire monitoring body, CTSAMM, prove that the South Sudanese army violated the ceasefire agreement, prevented humanitarian access and committed war crimes and atrocities.

Title: Machar calls for confidence-building measures before to take part in peace celebration in Juba - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Kiir (R) speaks with Machar during the signing ceremony of the revitalized peace agreement on 12 September 2018 (UNMISS Photo)September 24, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – South Sudan main opposition leader Riek Machar welcomed an invitation extended by President Salva Kiir to take part in a peace celebration the government plans to hold in Juba and called to take some confidence-building measures before his return.
Since two years ago, Machar’s movements have been restricted by the IGAD and he was confined in South Africa. After the signing of the revitalized peace agreement, the regional body decided that he can stay in a country of his choice “until his final status is determined at the upcoming Ordinary Summit of the IGAD Assembly”.
SPLM-IO Deputy Chairperson of the National Committee for Information and Public Relations Manawa Peter Gatkuoth said President Kiir last Sunday extended an invitation to Machar to participate in a big rally the government plans to organize in Juba within its efforts to promote peace and reconciliation.
Manawa who is currently in Khartoum with the group leader added that Machar suggested to President Kiir to lift the state of emergency, release the political prisoners and the end the speech of hatred in the state media outlets.
“Such measures would contribute to build confidence and promote reconciliation because the continued deployment of the army soldiers everywhere and restriction of freedoms under the emergency law by the security agents are no longer justified after the signing of the revitalized peace agreement,” he told Sudan Tribune.
He further pointed to the situation of Machar who has to abide by the IGAD’s decision banning his return to South Sudan for the time being.
“Machar asked President Machar to ask the IGAD leaders to end the restriction imposed on his movements,” he said.
The SPLM-IO says they released all the prisoners of war they have in their jails across the country and wonders why Juba still holds in jails its members to start by James Gatdet Dak, Machar’s spokesperson.
On a related development, Manawa said they called on the ceasefire monitoring body and the IGAD countries guarantors of the peace agreement to ensure Juba commitment to the ceasefire agreement.
He accused the South Sudanese army and its allied militias of continuing to violate the ceasefire agreement pointing to the fresh attacks reported by the group’s military spokesperson.

The joint forces fired indiscriminately into the crowd of IDPs killing three men and two women and injuring 26 others who sustained gunshot wounds
At least 5 people were killed and 26 others sustained gunshot wounds when joint forces of Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) opened live ammunition on a crowd of protestors at Hasahisa camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Zalingi, Central Darfur, on 20 January.

On 20 January, at 3 pm, the joint forces raided Tololo market, located inside the camp, and fired live ammunition at a crowd of IDPs while they protested against the insecurity and the continuous attacks on residents in the camp by the Janjaweed militias. According to reliable source, the joint forces fired indiscriminately into the crowd of IDPs killing three men and two women and injuring 26 others who sustained gunshot wounds and are currently receiving medical treatment at Zalingi hospital.
The names of the deceased are:

The names of those injured are:

On 21 January, the joint forces set ablaze nine water pumps used to supply water to the IDP camp. The destruction of the water pumps exacerbates the socio-economic situation of the IDPs who often face difficulties in accessing enough water resources. It also places IDPs at risk of attacks such as sexual violence as they would have to travel distances to access the needed water resources.
These killings form part of a larger pattern of the use of violence to suppress freedom of expression, association, and assembly in Darfur and across Sudan. ACJPS has documented various incidents of the use of force against IDPs in Darfur and no investigations into the killings have been carried out or findings have been made public in case an investigation was carried out.
Protest killings have taken place in a climate of total impunity. Immunities provided in law to government officials, including members of the NISS, SAF and the police have prevented effective investigations into allegations of the excessive use of force and resulted in a lack of prosecutions for the perpetration of these and other human rights violations.
Authorities should conduct an urgent investigation with a view to identifying and prosecuting persons responsible for the killing 5 IDPs and injury of 26 IDPs. Findings of the investigation should be made public and those responsible should be held accountable before an independent and impartial court. Authorities must further ensure that medical and other appropriate support services are available to all those in need including the 26 injured displaced persons. The Government should condemn the destruction of the water pumps and provide restitution to the IDPs through re-installation of water pumps to ensure that water flow to the camp is restored. It should be made clear to authorities involved in the destruction of property will be held liable for their actions.
The African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) calls on the Sudanese authorities to immediately put in place measures to protect civilians in and around Hasahisa IDP camp.
ACJPS reiterates previous calls to the Sudanese authorities to ensure that the policing of assemblies must respect human rights and must be carried out in accordance with international standards, which prohibit the use of force unless strictly necessary and proportionate. It should also be made clear that arbitrary or abusive use of force by security forces will be punished as a criminal offence.
The international community, particularly the European Union, United States, and African Union, should publicly and privately press the Sudanese government to meet its obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law and to ensure unfettered access by UNAMID peacekeepers to all parts of Darfur especially the IDP camps.

Landslide affected area in eastern Jebel Marra on 14 September 2018 (Photo SLM-AW)October 1, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – The Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdel Wahid (SLM-AW) Monday accused the Sudanese army of shelling civilians areas in southwestern Jebel Marra.
The holdout rebel group which is active in the mountainous area of Jebel Marra recently announced a three-month ceasefire to allow humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by mudslides in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur.
SLM-AW spokesperson Mohamed Abdel Rahman al-Nayer said in a statement released that the Sudanese artillery Monday shelled villages and civilian communities around the areas of Baladunq, Galol, Torung Toura and Sorong.
“The shelling has caused some material and human losses among unarmed civilians,” he said without more details.
He further expressed the readiness of the rebel fighters to respond to any aggression on “the liberated areas and the villages of unarmed civilians”.
Nonetheless, he reiterated the group commitment to the unilateral cessation of hostilities they declared last month to provide emergency assistance to the civilians affected by the mudslides in East Jebel Marra.
On 20 September, a joint team composed UNAMID civilian staff and the Humanitarian Country Team including six doctors reached the affected area to assess the humanitarian situation.
Also, it provided medical assistance and “non-food items such as tents and plastic sheets for shelter, kitchen sets, blankets and mosquito nets to the affected community,” according to the UNAMID.
However, al-Nayer said in his statement that the affected areas continue to be in “dire need of humanitarian assistance”. He further called on the international and national organizations to join efforts to alleviate the calamity of civilians in Jebel Marra and to provide them with the needed assistance.
Last September, heavy rains caused mudslides in Wadi Tuliba and Tagulei villages of Jebel Marra, killing 19 people according to the local sources.

Title: HRW: Civilians attacked, students and journalists detained in 2017 - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
In the past year Sudan’s human rights record continued to be defined by government repression and violations of basic civil and political rights, restriction of religious freedoms, and disregard for obligations on civilian protection under international humanitarian law.
In the past year Sudan’s human rights record continued to be defined by government repression and violations of basic civil and political rights, restriction of religious freedoms, and disregard for obligations on civilian protection under international humanitarian law.
In itsWorld Report 2018on Sudan, Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlighted a number of the human rights violations and atrocities that the country has witnessed in the year 2017.
The human rights organisation reported that civilians have been attacked by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and other government-aligned forces in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, in spite of the government’srepeatedly extended unilateral ceasefire.
“Sudan failed to provide accountability for serious crimes committed during the conflicts, or other serious human rights violations,” the report read. Despite reduced fighting in all three war zones, government forces and allied militia attacked civilians including in camps for displaced people throughout the year.
In May and June, the RSF attacked villages in North and Central Darfur, forcingtens of thousands to flee. RSF fighters were also responsible for large-scale attacks on villages during counterinsurgency campaigns from 2014 to 2016.
In Blue Nile and South Kordofan, conflict continued and there were sporadic government attacks on civilians. In the rebel held areas of both states, hundreds of thousandslacked sufficient foodand basic supplies because the government and rebels failed to agree on modalities for the delivery of essential items.
Detentions
The national security agency NISSdetained student activists,human rights defenders, and members of opposition parties. Authorities prosecuted activists andjournalistsfor their reports and confiscated newspapers.
Security officials detained opposition members, journalists, and labor leaders throughout the year, often for long periods without charge or access to lawyers. They routinely beat detainees during interrogations. One Sudan Congress Party (SCP) member was held for 50 days without charge, and beaten so badly that he required surgery upon his release.
In December 2016, a British journalist and his Sudanese-American colleague were detained first in Darfur then transferred to Khartoum for almost two months without charge and said they weresubjected to beatings, electric shocks, and mock execution, for conducting an investigation in Darfur.
Freedom of expression
Government security forces used excessive force to break up protests across the country, including protests at university campuses. In September, government forces opened fire on protesters in the Kalma displaced people’s camp in South Darfur,killing more than fiveand wounding two dozen. The residents were protesting President Omar Al Bashir’s visit to the camp.
Security officials also continued to restrict media by harassing and detaining journalists, charging them with crimes, andconfiscating editions of newspapersthat published articles deemed too sensitive.
International actors
HRW stressed that in January, then-United States President Barack Obama issued an executive order promising to lift broad economic sanctions if Sudan met certain conditions. While these did not require measurable improvements in human rights, the sanctionshave been lifted.
The EU has pledged hundreds of millions of euros to Sudan in support of the regional Khartoum Process, to manage migration. The aid programs have beenwidely criticizedon grounds that they encourage or assist the RSF to carry out abusive operations.
In September, the UN Human Rights Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert tomonitor and adviseon human rights for another year, but used language foreshadowing the end of the mandate if there is “continued and sustained improvement” to the situation in the country, risking prematurely ending the mandate in coming years.

Title: Two militiamen injured in clashes with IDPs in South Darfur - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
January 2, 2018 (NYALA) - Two elements from the government militia Rapid Support Forces (SRF) have been seriously wounded in clashes with Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Monday at Otash camp, some three kilometres east of South Darfur State capital, Nyala.
Deputy Chairman of IDPs and Refugees Association Adam Abdalla Idris told Sudan Tribune Tuesday the clashes occurred after two RSF elements refused to pay for a meal they had eaten at a restaurant inside the camp, forcing the restaurant owner to inform the camp police.
He added the police sought to arrest the RSF elements but they resisted their orders and fired at them until they ran out of ammunition.
“Then a group of IDPs attacked [the two RSF elements] and harshly beat them, causing them serious injuries,” said Idris.
According to Idris, the police barely pulled off the two elements of the hands of the IDPs and rushed them to hospital.
He pointed out that the situation at the camp is calm but expressed fear of a possible revenge by the RSF, calling on the government to enhance police presence in the camp to prevent targeting of IDPs.
A reliable source told Sudan Tribune the North Nyala Police hasn’t completed the filing of the charges because the injured RSF elements are being treated.
He added the security organs are monitoring the conditions closely to deal with any kind of lawlessness situation.
In 2014, the presence of RSF in North Kordofan state capital of El-Obeid drew widespread condemnation from residents who accused it of spreading terror.
These forces were blamed for looting commercial markets and killing of a merchant in El-Obeid leading to massive protests across the city.
Also, in 2014 the RSF recruits in Sulait camp clashed with residents of Hattab village in Khartoum North leading to the intervention of the Sudanese army.
The RSF militia was originally mobilised by the Sudanese government to quell the insurgency that broke out in Sudan’s western region of Darfur in 2003.
Last year, the Sudanese parliament passed RSF Act which integrates the notorious militia in the Sudanese army and provides that its commander is appointed by the President of the Republic.

Plural news and views on Sudan
Kiir (R) speaks with Machar during the signing ceremony of the revitalized peace agreement on 12 September 2018 (UNMISS Photo)September 17, 2018 (JUAB) – President Salva Kiir Monday said he personally spoke with SPLM-IO Riek Machar and asked him to order his troops to stop the fighting in Yei River State and to commit himself to the signed peace agreement.
Hours after signing of the revised peace agreement in Addis Ababa, the SPLM-IO accused the government forces of attacking their position in several areas of the troubled Yei River State not far from the Ugandan border.
In response to the resumption of the fighting, the ceasefire monitoring body CTSAMM launched an investigation to the claim as several international and regional circles had the impression of the déjà-vu situation.
President Salva Kiir who repeatedly voiced his commitment to an agreement he “voluntarily” signed on Monday discoed to cease these clashes immediately, adding that his army had been attacked by the SPLM-IO fighters.
“It was my initiative to call him and ask him why he is still fighting us when we have signed the agreement. So I told him, ‘What is this? Is it the acquisition of more territories? We have signed the agreement. I don’t want us to go back to war again,” Kiir said.
The president who was speaking at a memorial service in Juba for the victims of a plane crash in Yirol on 9 September added he asked him to order his fighters on Yei to stop attacking the government forces again.
The SPLA Spokesperson Lul Ruai Koang on Sunday issued a statement saying their forces had come under unprovoked attacks on two positions Kupera County and in Sokare, Kajo-Keji County of Yei River State.
Further, he accused the SPLA-IO fighters of attacking their position in Southern Liech State where they captured Mirmir Junction which connects Leer with Bentiu.
Maj. Gen. Lual further said that the SPLM-IO “Wanted to recapture more territories which they would use as assembly areas and cantonment sites” and to draw the attention of the Commander of Africom Force when they learnt he would visit Juba on 17 September, as he said
President Kiir who accompanied by First Vice President Taban Deng Gai reiterated his commitment to the revitalized peace agreement stressing that the suffering of the affected people “provided the primary motivation” for his government to end the five-year war.
“I want to appeal to all of you to accept and embrace this peace and (forgive) your brothers and sisters from the opposition side so that we close the dark chapter on the wall by forgiving each other,” he said.
The CTSAMM didn’t yet disclose the outcome of its findings on the ground.

♦ Sudanese-Eritrean border closed in Kassala, RSF troops deployed
January 9 – 2018  KASSALAThe Sudanese government deployed thousands of paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) along the border with Eritrea last week which has reportedly been closed. On Saturday, the Governor of Kassala ordered the closure of all border crossings in the state.
“Thousands of RSF troops riding in hundreds of Land Cruisers and tanks arrived in the eastern part of the state since Wednesday afternoon,” a listener told Radio Dabanga from Kassala on Friday. “No explanations were given.”
During an inspection of El Laffa on Friday, Governor Adam Jamaa denied that the border with Eritrea was closed on Thursday. Jamaa said that the deployed paramilitaries are responsible for collecting illegal arms, conducting an inventory of unlicensed vehicles, and combating of the smuggling of people and goods in the state.
Kassala and North Kordofan states are in a State of Emergency. In end December, the government’s campaign of the collection of illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles was extended to these areas. The decision by the Sudanese presidency to impose the State of Emergency surprised politicians and lawyers,who expectedthat the government will use it to tighten its suppression on the currently developing public unrest because of the scarcity of bread and fuel.
Minister Rashid Haroun Adam defended the decision at the Sudanese parliament on Monday and said that without imposing the State of Emergency, the two states face threats of civil conflict and risks for the local economy.

Title: UNAMID quick withdrawal puts Darfur at risk, say UK lawmakers - Sudan Tribune

Plural news and views on Sudan
Sudan Tribune
Plural news and views on Sudan
A photo released on 1 March 2018 showing  an UNAMID integrated team conducts a humanitarian and security assessment mission to Golo and Rokero, Central Darfur ( UNAMID Photo)September 20, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – A delegation of UK parliamentarians visiting Sudan nowadays stated that the hastened pullout of UNAMID troops from Darfur region may jeopardize the relative stability in the region as the displaced persons are still living in the camps.
A four-member delegation from the House of Commons and House of Lords on Wednesday met with the North Darfur governor, Abu Shouk camp for IDPs outside, and  UNAMID officials.
In a statement extended to Sudan Tribune, David Drew MP, leader of the visiting delegation warned against the ongoing downsizing of the peacekeeping mission in Darfur region.
“Withdrawing too quickly without a clear plan puts the progress made in Darfur at risk. Any further cuts must reflect genuine improvements on the ground, as well as assurances that the UN Country Team will have the resources and support necessary to fill the gaps,” said Mp Drew.
On Friday 13 July, the UN Security Council decided to cut the troop strength of the hybrid mission from 8,735 to 4,050 personnel and to maintain its police strength at the current level of 2,500 personnel.
Drew admitted that the improvement of the security situation in Darfur, however, he stressed that there are” too many IDPs” who feel “unable or unwilling” to return to their home areas due to security concerns.
“The conflict in Darfur has changed, but instability and insecurity remain,” he said.
According to the UNAMID reconfiguration plan, the hybrid mission will shut down its 14 sites in Darfur, except for 13 sites in the Greater Jebel Marra area. Also, its headquarters should be in Golo town of Central Darfur State.
The visiting delegation of British lawmakers is part of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Sudan and South Sudan which promotes peace, human rights, justice and development in Sudan and South Sudan.

Title: World Report 2018 - Sudan: Events of 2017 [EN/AR] - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan+ 1 more
Sudan’s human rights record continued to be defined by government repression and violations of basic civil and political rights, restriction of religious freedoms, and disregard for obligations on civilian protection under international humanitarian law.
In Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and other government-aligned forces attacked civilians. Sudan failed to provide accountability for serious crimes committed during the conflicts, or other serious human rights violations.The national security agency detained student activists, human rights defenders, members of opposition parties and journalists. Authorities prosecuted activists and journalists for their reports and confiscated newspapers.
In January, then-United States President Barack Obama issued an executive order promising to lift broad economic sanctions if Sudan met certain conditions; these did not require measurable improvements in human rights.
Conflict and Abuses in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile Despite the government’s unilateral ceasefire and reduced fighting in all three war zones, government forces and allied militia attacked civilians including in displaced persons camps throughout the year.
In May and June, the RSF attacked villages in North and Central Darfur, forcing tens of thousands to flee. RSF fighters were responsible for large-scale attacks on villages during counterinsurgency campaigns from 2014 to 2016.
In Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, the six-year conflict continued, with sporadic government attacks on civilians. In Blue Nile and in refugee camps in neighboring South Sudan, displaced communities fought along ethnic lines following a split within the leadership of the armed opposition, Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North.In the rebel held areas of both states, hundreds of thousands lacked sufficient food and basic supplies because the government and rebels failed to agree on modalities for the delivery of essential items.
Attacks on Human Rights Defenders
In December 2016 and January 2017, national security agents detained Dr. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a prominent rights defender, along with several other activists and held them for up to eight months. Mudawi and two others were charged with undermining the constitutional system and crimes against the state, which carry the death penalty. At least two detainees were badly beaten and one was forced to confess under torture. They were released by presidential pardon in August.
In March, authorities released three human rights defenders associated with the civil society organization Tracks for Training and Human Development, after nine months in detention. The men were convicted of trumped-up charges of espionage and dissemination of false information.
National security agents arrested the men along with other Tracks staff in May 2016. In August 2016, the United Nations Working Group of Arbitrary Detention found the detentions violated fair trial standards.
Arbitrary Detentions, Ill-Treatment, and Torture
Security officials detained opposition members, journalists, and labor leaders throughout the year, often for long periods without charge or access to lawyers. They routinely beat detainees during interrogations.
Following the “civil disobedience” campaign to protest economic austerity measures in November and December 2016, agents detained dozens of opposition members. One Sudan Congress Party (SCP) member was held for 50 days without charge, and beaten so badly that he required surgery upon his release.
In December 2016, a British journalist and his Sudanese-American colleague were detained first in Darfur then transferred to Khartoum for almost two months without charge and said they were subjected to beatings, electric shocks, and mock execution. The two entered Darfur to investigate Amnesty International’s allegations of chemical weapons use by the government.
In April, security officials detained for several days three doctors involved in a doctor’s strike that began in late 2016 over work conditions. Several SCP members were detained in June from a sit-in about a cholera outbreak. In September, security officials detained a diaspora SCP member for seven weeks. In August, security officials detained Nasreddin Mukhtar, former head of a Darfur Student Union, and held him without charge in solitary confinement.
Freedoms of Association, Assembly, and Expression
Government security forces used excessive force to break up protests across the country.In September, government forces opened fire on protesters in the Kalma displaced persons camp in South Darfur, killing more than five and wounding two dozen. The residents were protesting President al-Bashir’s visit to the camp.
Authorities also used excessive force on several occasions to disperse protests on university campuses. In May, following clashes over disputed elections at Bakht al-Rida university in White Nile state, police and security forces raided a dormitory, beat and shot students, wounding several, and arrested dozens. In response to the arrests, more than 1,000 Darfuri students withdrew from the university, alleging discrimination against Darfuri students. Nine students remained in detention by year’s end.
In August and September, security officials detained dozens of members of the United Popular Front, a student branch of a Darfur rebel group, while protesting on the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman. Officials arrested many other student activists throughout the year.
By the end of 2017, there had been no justice for the killings of more than 170 people during violent government crackdowns on popular anti-austerity protests in September and October 2013.
Freedom of Media
Security officials continued to restrict media by harassing and detaining journalists, charging them with crimes, and confiscating editions of newspapers that published articles deemed too sensitive.
In October, a court ordered the editor of al-Tayyar to pay a fine or spend six months in prison for publishing an article about alleged abuse of power in the president’s family.Other journalists, including Hanadi el-Siddig, editor-in-chief of Akhbar El Watan, were interrogated or detained for content deemed too critical, such as allegations of abuse by security forces and an interview with an opposition leader. Marwa Tijani was detained for three days after publishing a piece of creative writing critiquing religion.
Three online activists were deported from Saudi Arabia to Sudan and detained there in July, allegedly for their writings in support of the 2016 “civil disobedience” campaign to protest austerity measures. Authorities confiscated both independent and pro-government newspapers, including El Tayar, El Jareeda, Akhar Lahza, El Wifag, and El Sayha, often without giving reason.
Freedom of Religion
In early 2017, officials in Khartoum announced they would demolish at least 27 churches within Khartoum; the decision was being challenged by a church organization. In May, police and other security demolished a church in Soba area of Khartoum following a dispute over land ownership.
Officials have prohibited construction of new churches. In 2013, the minister of guidance and endowments claimed there was no need for new churches as South Sudanese Christians would have returned to South Sudan following its independence in 2011.
In October, police arrested five members of the Sudan Church of Christ, charging them with public nuisance for praying at a church that authorities closed, in a case that illustrates disputes over the administration of churches.
In February and May, al-Bashir pardoned two clerics—a Czech missionary and Sudanese pastor—and a Darfuri activist who had been detained since December 2015. The men were among five arrested in December 2015 and accused of links to armed opposition, and charged with espionage and other crimes.
Refugees and Migrants
Sudan continued to receive large numbers of South Sudanese refugees. Approximately 183,500 arrived in 2017, bringing the total to more than 461,000 since war in South Sudan began in December 2013. Sudan agreed to open humanitarian aid corridors to South Sudan.
In August, Sudanese authorities deported 104 Eritrean refugees, including 30 minors. In September, the government reportedly deported another 36. None of the deportees appear to have had an opportunity to apply for asylum. The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, called on Sudan to refrain from further removals of potential refugees.The head of the notoriously abusive Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemeti,” publicly claimed that his forces were assisting the European Union, raising concerns that the EU is funding the abusive forces as part of its migration assistance package.
Law Reform
Following the conclusion of the national dialogue, a government initiative to address political grievances, President al-Bashir appointed a prime minister to implement recommendations and form a new government. Many opposition parties rejected the dialogue process.
In January, Sudan’s parliament passed the Rapid Support Forces Act to regulate the force, but forces continued to operate under the same commander independently of the army.
Sudan has not reformed laws governing its security agency. The National Security Act of 2010 gave broad powers of arrest, detention, search, and seizure and violates accepted international standards, to which Sudan is bound. Sudan also retains the death penalty, despite international consensus to ban it.
Sudanese law discriminates against women and girls in various ways, including through application of Sharia (Islamic) law penalties for “morality crimes,” such as adultery or dress code violations. Sudan also criminalizes same-sex sexual activity with harsh penalties such as life in prison or death.
Key International Actors
In January, former US President Obama issued an executive order promising to lift broad economic sanctions on Sudan if Sudan made progress in five areas, which did not explicitly include human rights reforms. This step was welcomed by the EU. In October, the US permanently lifted the sanctions.
The EU has pledged hundreds of millions of euros to Sudan in support of the regional Khartoum Process, to manage migration. The aid programs have been widely criticized on grounds that they encourage or assist the RSF to carry out abusive operations.In March, President al-Bashir attended a League of Arab States’ summit in Amman, Jordan.Jordan did not comply with its obligation, as a party to the Rome Statute, to arrest and surrender him to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini also attended the summit but did not publicly call on Jordanian authorities to comply with their obligation.In July, the UN Security Council renewed the peacekeeping mission in Darfur through June 2018, agreeing to dramatic reductions as part of an exit plan lobbied for by Sudan, and extended the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei.
In September, the UN Human Rights Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert to monitor and advise on human rights for another year, but used language foreshadowing the end of the mandate if there is “continued and sustained improvement” to the situation in the country, risking prematurely ending the mandate in coming years.The Security Council did not press Sudan to cooperate with the ICC in its investigation into crimes committed in Darfur, despite having referred the situation to the ICC in 2005. The ICC first announced charges in 2007. It currently has outstanding arrest warrants against five individuals, including President al-Bashir, for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur between 2003 and 2008.

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Rapid Support Forces beat a trader in the Garsila crop market in Darfur on Monday after he refused to adjust the price for cereals. The market was closed after the incident.
Rapid Support Forces beat a trader in the Garsila crop market in Darfur on Monday after he refused to adjust the price for cereals. The market was closed after the incident.
Witnesses reported to Radio Dabanga that the members of the RSF, led by Ahmed Shagab, entered the crop market in Central Darfur and demanded merchants to set their price for cereals at SDG 40 ($5.70). They started beating Abdel Banat when he refused to do so.
A week ago, traders in a market in West Darfur faced the same demands made by RSF members. Four of thetraders were arrested as they refusedto lower their prices. Others protested and closed the market.
The prices of consumer goods such as sugar, flour, spaghetti, oil and milk in markets in Sudan have soread. In early January, the Sudanese markets were hit by the consequences of financial measures taken by the government based on the 2018 National Budget.
Price control
In Khartoum, President Omar Al Bashir directed the competent authorities to dismantle what he called the monopoly of commodity prices, to control prices, and monitor the markets on a daily basis, in order to ensure that goods are easily accessible to the people in Sudan.
During a meeting yesterday, Al Bashir instructed the authorities to discuss exchange rate controls with the Ministries of Trade and Industry, in coordination with concerned parties. This would happen in discussion with “private government factories” that have direct outlets for their products so as to ease burdens on Sudanese people.

Title: Darfur returnees forced to remain in insecure area - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan
On Thursday, members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, prevented dozens of formerly displaced South Darfur villagers to flee again.
Two weeks ago, about 300 people returned from the Shangil Tobaya camps for the displaced in Tawila locality to their home villages in the area of El Malam in northern South Darfur.
When they discovered that militiamen and other gunmen are still roaming in the area, dozens of them decided to return to the relative safety of the camps. RSF troops, however, prevented them from leaving, and detained four village sheikhs who protested their action.
“Ismail Azhari, Yagoub Younis, Adam Hamid, and Adam Suleiman are now being held at the prison of El Malam,” a returnee told Radio Dabanga from the town. “The South Darfur governor will decided on their fate, as well as the fate of 71 villagers who were prevented from leaving.”
The source said that the area of El Malam is “devoid of any security”.
‘Safe and secure’
In July 2011, the Sudanese government signed the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur with the Liberation and Justice Movement -formed a year earlier by 19 breakaway factions of the main Darfur rebel movements.
The peace talks were brokered by the Government of Qatar. In April 2013, Qatar hosted aninternational donor conferencefor the reconstruction of Sudan’s conflict-torn western region. The Gulf state itself pledged to support the peace process with development projects, including the construction of model villages intended to house displaced Darfuris returning to their home areas.
In February 2016, the UN and the government of Sudan signed documents worth$88.5 millionin contributions from Qatar for projects in all Darfur states over a period of nearly two years. The majority would be spent on model villages. In August this year, Doha granted another$70 millionfor the construction of model villages in Darfur.
Most of the Darfur displaced categoricallyreject returning homeor relocation tomodel villagesas they consider the situation far from secure enough to leave the camps.
In August this year, Khartoum started a massive disarmament campaign in the five Darfur states in an attempt to stabilise the region. The RSF and the army are tasked with the collection of illegal weapons and vehicles.
The results are not meeting the expectations, the North Darfur governoracknowledged last week.

The Sudanese government deployed thousands of paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) along the border with Eritrea last week. On Saturday, the Governor of Kassala ordered the closure of all border crossings in the state.
“Thousands of RSF troops riding in hundreds of Land Cruisers and tanks arrived in the eastern part of the state since Wednesday afternoon,” A listener told Radio Dabanga from Kassala on Friday.
The Sudanese government deployed thousands of paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces(RSF)along the border with Eritrea last week. On Saturday, the Governor of Kassala ordered the closure of all border crossings in the state.
“Thousands of RSF troops riding in hundreds of Land Cruisers and tanks arrived in the eastern part of the state since Wednesday afternoon,” A listener told Radio Dabanga from Kassala on Friday.
“They closed the border crossings of El Laffa and Awad on Thursday before reopening them again on Friday. No explanations were given,” he said.
A bridegroom told this station that he and his bride could not travel for their honeymoon to Eritrea on Thursday.
The Governor of Kassala, Adam Jamaa, said that the paramilitaries are responsible for collecting illegal arms, conducting an inventory of unlicensed vehicles, and combating of the smuggling of people and goods in the state.
During an inspection of El Laffa on Friday, the governor denied that the border with Eritrea was closed on Thursday. He said that people should not believe these rumours, and emphasised that citizens and goods have been able to cross the border at the Awad, Karayit, and El Laffa check points without a problem throughout the week.
On Saturday however, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported that the Governor of Kassala ordered theclosure of all border crossing points with Eritreaas of January 5 until further notice.
State of Emergency
In July,Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaign in the country, to begin with in the five states of Darfur, and South and West Kordofan.Members of the RSF and army soldierswere employed in August to implement the measures.
In end December, the collection of illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles was extended to North Kordofan and Kassala. For this reason, the State of Emergency was imposed in both states.
Politicians and activists in the two states howeverdoubt the reasonfor the measure. “The Sudanese Constitution conditions a declaration of a State of Emergency with disasters and epidemics or foreign intervention,” a lawyer told this station.
“Implementing such a measure aims to cut the way for any possible street protests from against the passage of the 2018 budget, the repeated sharp rise of basic consumer prices, and the escalating fuel and wheat shortages,”Mohamed Iheimir, Head of the Unified National Unionist Party in Kassala commented.

Title: Sudan says awaiting African mediation invitation to resume Two Areas talks - Sudan Tribune

October 6, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – The Sudanese government has renewed commitment to achieve peace in the Two Areas expressing readiness to respond to any invitation from the African mediation to resume talks with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/North (SPLM-N).
Mbeki speaks to participants at the inaugral session of Strategic Consultations Meeting in Addis Ababa on 18 March 2016 (AUHIP Photo)The Sudanese army has been fighting the SPLM-N rebels in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan, also known as the Two Areas since 2011.
Member of the government negotiating team for the Two Areas talks Al-Hadi Osman Andu said the government acceptance of the recent United Nations proposal to deliver humanitarian aid to rebel-held areas would enhance chances to revive peace talks.
He called on the SPLM-N to listen to the voices of the Two Areas residents and appreciate their sufferings which have continued for three decades, describing the government acceptance of the UN proposal as “positive qualitative leap”.
Andu denied that the African mediation has set any date to resume the peace talks, saying the government would accept an invitation in this regard.
Last month, the Sudanese government agreed to a UN initiative to deliver humanitarian assistance to civilians in the rebel-controlled areas in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.
The SPLM-N is now divided into two factions: one led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu and the other led by Malik Agar. The rift emerged last year over the right of self-determination and other organisational issues.
Talks between the Sudanese government and the SPLM-N for a cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access are stalled since August 2016.
The SPLM-N demands to deliver 20% of the humanitarian assistance through a humanitarian corridor from Asosa, an Ethiopian border town.
But the government rejects the idea saying it is a breach of the state sovereignty and a manoeuvre from the rebels to bring arms and ammunition to their locked rebel-held areas in the Two Areas.
The SPLM-N, in November 2016 declined an American proposal to transport humanitarian medical assistance directly to the civilians in the rebel-held areas in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan.
Also, during the last round of talks from 1 to 3 February, the Sudanese government and SPLM-N al-Hilu failed to reach a cessation of hostilities agreement.
The mediation delinked the ceasefire and the humanitarian access and focused at this round only on the cessation of hostilities agreement.
However, differences between the sides emerged when Khartoum proposed that the cessation of hostilities be a step towards a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian access.

The six injured students are currently at El Geneina hospital receiving medical treatment
The Government of Sudan must condemn in the strongest terms the excessive use of force by its police and security forces in El Geneina, West Darfur on Sunday 7 January and conduct an immediate independent and impartial investigation into the death of one student and injury of six others and hold those responsible to account.

On 7 January 2018 at 10 AM, in Al Madaris neighborhood, El Geneina, hundreds of secondary school students organized a peaceful procession to condemn the increase of the price of bread. As the students marched towards the office of the state governor, located close to the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) office, they came across a fleet of armored vehicles of the joint forces of NISS, Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Police who fired live ammunition into the crowd to disperse them. Seven students sustained gunshot wounds, one of whom was shot in the chest and died on spot. According to eyewitness accounts, the deceased is said to have been shot by an officer of the RSF. The RSF is a paramilitary government force under the command of the NISS.
In Sudan, the police are in charge of policing demonstrations, however, in some cases, the NISS and armed forces have concurrent powers during demonstrations as provided by article 6 (2) of the Armed Forces Act 2007 and article 50 (1) of the National Security Act 2010. The use of force to disperse assemblies is authorized in the Criminal Procedure Act 1991 and the Police Act 2008. In anews articleby BBC, Babikir Digna, the Sudanese Minister of State for Internal Affairs is quoted to have said that the authorities would deal firmly with any acts of sabotage and chaos.
All seven students were taken to El Geneina hospital for medical attention. The six injured students are currently at El Geneina hospital receiving medical treatment.
Name of the deceased:

Names of injured persons who sustained gunshot wounds:

At about 3 PM, a number of people gathered at the hospital to receive the body of the deceased for the arranged funeral ceremony however the police fired tear gas at the crowd and only allowed the family of the deceased to receive the body.
The Minister of Education for West Darfur issued a decree suspending study for all students of primary and secondary schools for a week, beginning 7 January until 14 January.
ACJPS reiterates its calls for the security forces responsible for killing and injuring protesters to be held to account. Sudan should stop violently suppressing protests and demonstrations and guarantee the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly, as provided under Sudanese and international law. The Government of Sudan should ensure that security forces carry their mandate in accordance with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Ensure in particular that security forces refrain from using excessive and disproportionate force against demonstrators and that reports of such violations are thoroughly and independently investigated with a view to bringing those responsible to justice promptly.
Background
The Government of Sudan increased the import dollar rate from 6.7 Sudanese pounds to 18 Sudanese pounds. As a result of this, prices on basic commodities drastically increased to double or triple the price. The first attempt by the Government to increase the import dollar rate occurred in November 2016 which resulted into a call for civil disobedience from the Sudanese public.
Over the years, a deteriorating economy and other austerity measures have fuelled popular discontent amongst the Sudanese people, leading to a surge in demonstrations across the country. These demonstrations have been met with excessive use of force by authorities to disperse protests and public gathering in recent years.  The unnecessary use of force by authorities to suppress protests has resulted into killing and injuring of many protestors.
In September 2017, ACJPS documented the killing of at least five people and injury of 29 others after Sudanese forces opened live ammunition on a crowd of protestors at Kalma camp of internally displaced persons in Nyala, South Darfur on 22 September, shortly before a planned visit by President Omar al-Bashir.
InJanuary 2016, at least seven people, including one child, were killedwhen security forces opened live ammunition at a crowd of protestors outside the West Darfur state governor’s office. The crowd had gathered to demand protection after the nearby village of Mouli was looted and burned to the ground. The following day, three people were killed and seven others sustained gunshot wounds when security forces again fired live ammunition at the funeral for the deceased.
In September 2013,at least 185 people were killedaround the country when government forces shot at anti-austerity protestors.Human rights defenders and victims’ rights groups calling for justice and accountability for the 2013 protest killingswere subjected to arbitrary arrests and harassment
The protest killings have taken place in a climate of total impunity. Immunities provided in law to government officials, including members of the NISS, SAF and the police have prevented effective investigations into allegations of the excessive use of force and resulted in a lack of prosecutions for the perpetration of these and other human rights violations. This includes the failure, three years on, to hold anyone to account for the killing of 185 people during the protests in 2013.

Title: RSF commander accused of abductions in South Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The abduction of three girls by a commander of the Rapid Support Forces in South Darfur on Saturday sparked a demonstration against the repeated abductions in the area.
The alleged abduction of three girls by a commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in South Darfur on Saturday sparked a demonstration against the repeated abductions in the area.
Members of the RSF, the main pro-givernment militia in Sudan, abducted three girls from their family houses in Birkatuli village in Abu Ajura, El Salam locality, on Saturday at 9pm. The girls have been taken to the RSF base 2 km south of Birkatuli by its commander, named Abdelrahman, villagers told Radio Dabanga.
“The commander entered the three houses and took three girls (aged 14, 15 and 17), and then moved to where he is based, south of the village,” one of the villagers said. The commander kept the girls at the base until releasing them the next evening at 8pm.
Residents of Birkatuli confirmed that the abduction of girls happened “by force of arms carried out by the RSF commander”. They claimed that this is not the first incident of its kind:
“This incident is the seventh of its kind at the hands of captain Abdelrahman. He has taken a number of people, including ten girls by force over the course of the year,” a villager said. He said that the incidents happen over farms, water resources and roads.
“We have been silent about the incidents throughout this period, out of fear for his vengeance and threats to hurt anyone who files a complaint.”
This time, however, the residents said they decided to hold a demonstration that condemned the incident. They filed a complaint to the police in Donki Dreisa and asked the state authorities to conduct an investigation in the area.

Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The disarmament campaign in the states of Darfur draws to a close. Militiamen who carried out the collection of illegal weapons and cars have reportedly refused to hand in the vehicles that were provided to them.
The disarmament campaign in the states of Darfur draws to a close. Militiamen who carried out the collection of illegal weapons and cars have reportedly refused to hand in the vehicles that were provided to them.
Sources confirmed that a number of militias in Darfur refused to hand over the weapons and Land Cruisers that were provided to them by Sudanese authorities, to carry out the disarmament activities.
“At the beginning of the weapons collection campaign, the authorities gave the militia vehicles with red plates, and allowed them to work in transportation,” a source told Radio Dabanga.
When the authorities declared that January 28 was the last day to hand in these vehicles at the headquarters of the military commandment in one of the five states, “most of the militias have refused to do so”.
Reportedly hundreds of militias in North, Central and West Darfur have crossed the border to Libya and Chad, towards Niger, while the militias in East and South Darfur have gone southward with the vehicles.
Another source said that the inventory of the vehicle collection has run up to 1,500 Land Cruisers seized from militias in West Darfur, while on Monday, an additional 150 vehicles were handed in at the military commandment of Infantry 15 in El Geneina.
“Hundreds of vehicles have crossed the northern border towards Chad in the last few weeks,” the source said.
Campaign
In the past weeks, people in Darfur repeatedly reported that soldiers of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)used violencewhile carrying out the collection campaign of illegal weapons in the region. The Sudanese government announced the campaign in July, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
RSF and the army began collecting illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians in the regions the following month. The campaign has entered the stage of compulsory collection of weapons by the reinforcements of RSF and the Sudanese army. In North Darfur alone,12,500 RSFand police have been deployed to assist with the arms collection and the controls of unregistered vehicles.
Food aid
In Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur, governor Jaafar Abdelhakam announced that the campaign will continue until the last rifle and bullet are collected at the military headquarters.
On Monday, officials of Unicef and the World Food Programme (WFP) met in Zalingei with governor Abdelhakam, and discussed what changes to the programmes are required to meet the needs of communities and the reduction of relief.
Abdelhakam called on both organisations to focus on the latter and in particular, to activate a food programme in Jebel Marra, where the project would contribute to the process of reconstruction and development

Title: Rapes by militiamen in North Darfur, South Kordofan - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
A 16-year-old has been raped, allegedly by a member of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia near Um Jahara village north Saraf Omra on Monday. In Um Brambeta in South Kordofan, a 50-year-old farmer was raped on January 14.
A 16-year-old has been raped, allegedly by a member of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia near Um Jahara village north Saraf Omra on Monday. In Um Brambeta in South Kordofan, a 50-year-old farmer was raped on January 14.
A member of the 16-year-old told Radio Dabanga that the incident happened when the girl went into the village valley to tie her donkey to the grass, where the militia member threatened and raped her.
He said that when the village residents learned of the incident, they notified the RSF near the village who arrested the alleged perpetrator and took him to their headquarters in Saraf Omra.
Activists in Saraf Umra expressed concern that the troops would cover-up their colleague's act to settle this serious issue away from the law.
The activists pointed to other concerns such as the emergence of members of the militiamen in uniforms wearing Kadamol scarves with weapons at Saraf Omra market in broad daylight without being confronted by any party, which threatens with insecurity and chaos.
South Kordofan
Human Rights and Development Organisation (HUDO) reports that on January 14, a woman farmer identified only as SK was raped by two members of Popular Defence Forces (PDF) in Um Brambita in South Kordofan.
A HUDO statement says that the victim reported the case to Um Brambeta police but the police did not carry out investigations or arrest the perpetrators.
”On 14th January 2017, SK (50) was in her garden one kilometre away from her village harvesting corn. As she was working, three armed men dressed in PDF uniform came closer, blocked and threatened her. Without delay, two of the soldiers started to rape her in turns while the third one observed and guarded them.
“SK reported what happened to her at Um-Brambeta police. The police gave her “form eight (8)” to enable her undergo a medical check-up of which she did. SK returned to Police with the medical report confirming that she was raped. Then police opened the case even without going to the scene of crime. The victim proved that given chance, she can recognize the perpetrators in order to help with investigations. But, the police told her to go and comeback after one month,” the report reads.
“HUDO is very concerned about the situation of women in SK State and the escape of perpetrators in such cases. Also the poor cooperation of police is an issue.”
HUDO calls upon the Sudan government to carry out genuine investigations and apprehend the perpetrators, Embassies in Sudan to put more pressure on Sudan government to uphold the rule of law, and for the Sudan government to end the impunity of its militias.
The HUDO statement says it centre regularly receives reports about rape cases committed by members of security agencies in South Kordofan. Generally, police opens such cases as “anonymous perpetrators”. Other victims are not given chance to open a case though the perpetrators are known and protected. The following are some cases that were reported:
