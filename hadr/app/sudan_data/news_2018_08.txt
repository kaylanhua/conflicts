August 25, 2019 (JUBA) – South Sudan National Revenue Authority (NRA) and TradeMark East Africa (TMEA) have inked an agreement to promote trade and help the young nation, whose economy largely depends on oil revenues, diversify into other sectors by establishing modern systems for the faster clearance of goods.
The deal, officials said in statement, will link South Sudan to the Regional Electronic Cargo Tracking system (RECTs), which is currently implemented on the Northern Corridor in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through the respective revenue and customs administrations.
RECTs is a web-based integrated system used to monitor transit cargo from departure to the final destination.
The new trade agreement is in important in that it will assist Juba in reducing the cost of security bonds, theft and diversions, and enhance security on the transit route from the port of Mombasa.
TMEA, however, said it hopes South Sudan’s Government of National Unity, expected to be inaugurated on November 12, will materialise.
“We are committed to doing our part, but it has to be stressed that we need a government of national unity to stick to the peace deal and start doing good work for the citizens in November,” said TMEA CEO Frank Matsaert at the signing of the deal on Friday last week.
South Sudan, where oil revenues make up nearly 98 percent of the budget, has been reeling an under economic crisis due to civil war.

Title: 28 illegal migrants arrested on Sudan-Libya border: RSF - Sudan | ReliefWeb
Sudan+ 1 more
August 28, 2018 (KHARTOUM) - The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said it has arrested twenty-eight illegal migrants the on border triangle among Libya, Sudan and Egypt on Monday.
Following the fall of Muammar Gaddafi’s 40-year-rule in 2011, Libya has slid into chaos and has become the most important transit country for illegal migrants to Europe.
In press statements on Tuesday, Director of Guidance and Services Department at the RSF Murtada Osman Abu al-Gasim said the 28 illegal migrants are Sudanese nationals, pointing out that they were heading towards the Libyan territory.
He added human trafficking gangs attempted to sneak the 28 illegal migrants into Libya, saying these are the same gangs that had recently kidnapped Egyptian troops.
Last month, Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) freed five Egyptian troops abducted by Libyan gunmen on the border triangle between Libya, Sudan and Egypt.
Abu al-Gasim also said the RSF continued to carry out its duties in protecting the national borders, stressing their keenness to maintain border security and stability.
He further said the RSF have been deployed on Sudan’s various borders to fight against negative phenomena including arms and illegal drugs smuggling and human trafficking.
In June 2016, hundreds of RSF elements have been deployed in the remote desert of the Northern State shortly after a complaint by the governor of drug and human trafficking by the criminal networks.
The RSF militia, which is widely known as the Janjaweed militias, were originally mobilised by the Sudanese government to quell the insurgency that broke out in Sudan’s western region of Darfur in 2003.
The militia was activated and restructured again in August 2013 under the command of the NISS to fight rebel groups in Darfur region, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states following joint attacks by Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebels in North and South Kordofan in April 2013.
Last year, the Sudanese parliament passed the RSF Act which integrates the
notorious militia in the Sudanese army and provides that its commander
is appointed by the President of the Republic.
Sudan is considered as a country of origin and transit for the illegal migration and human trafficking. Thousands of people from Eritrea and Ethiopia are monthly crossing the border into the Sudanese territories on their way to Europe through Libya or Egypt.
In January 2014, the Sudanese parliament approved an anti-human trafficking law which punishes those involved with human trafficking with up to 20 years imprisonment.
Also, in 2014, Khartoum hosted a conference on human trafficking in the Horn of Africa, organised by the African Union (AU), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Sudanese government.
The East African nation has also forged a strategic partnership with several European countries and the EU to combat illegal migration and human trafficking.

Title: North Darfur: Call for release of janjaweed leader’s deaf son - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The family of detained Ahmed Musa Hilal, hearing-impaired son of janjaweed leader Musa Hilal, who has been on a hunger strike at the notorious Shala prison in the North Darfur capital of El Fasher since Thursday, appealed to the Sudanese government represented in the governor of North Darfur, the security services, and police to intervene to release him.
The family of detained Ahmed Musa Hilal, hearing-impaired son ofjanjaweed leader Musa Hilal, who has been on a hunger strike at the notorious Shala prison in the North Darfur capital of El Fasher since Thursday, appealed to the Sudanese government represented in the governor of North Darfur, the security services, and police to intervene to release him.
The family also appealed to human rights organisations, all political forces, and activists to intervene for his release.
Ahmed Musa is the son of janjaweed leader and chairman of the Revolutionary Awakening Council (RAC) Musa Hilal, who was arrested ina raid on his stronghold in Misteriya, North Darfur, in November last year.
His sons, brothers, and entourage were detained to join the 2,000 people from Hilal’s clan.
On July 16, Ahmed Musa was arrested by gunmen from Kutum, taken to El Fasher and released before he was re-arrested on the same day.
It is widely believed that the arrest was carried out on personal orders from Brig. Gen. Madawi Hussein, the third-in-command of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, who was accused of killing Brigadier General Abdelrahim Jumaa on November.
It was reported that the police of North Darfur refused to receive detainee Ahmed on the pretext that he was special needs and has speech and hearing disabilities, before the RSF sentenced him and transferred him to Shala prison on charges of “talking and communicating with external parties”.

Title: EU-Zusammenarbeit mit Sudan: Fragwürdiger Pakt - DER SPIEGEL
Geflüchteter aus Südsudan in sudanesischem Camp
Es ist ein Freitag im September 2017. In Paris kommen mehrere hochrangige Sicherheitsvertreter aus vier EU-Ländern zu einer geheimen Sitzung zusammen. Für Deutschland nehmen ein Beamter der Bundespolizei und eine Migrationsreferentin des Auswärtigen Amtes teil, Frankreich schickt Vertreter des Nachrichtendienstes Civipol, auch Italien, Großbritannien und Interpol sind dabei.
Es geht um ein heikles EU-Projekt in Afrika: "ROCK" - die Abkürzung steht nicht für eine Musikinitiative, sondern für ein Operationszentrum in Sudans Hauptstadt, das Regional Operation Centre Khartoum.
ROCK soll Menschenhandel und grenzüberschreitende Kriminalität bekämpfen, vor allem aber: die Ursachen irregulärer Migration in Afrika angehen. Das Projekt ist zentraler Bestandteil des Khartum-Prozesses, einer Dialogplattform zwischen der EU und den Ländern am Horn von Afrika, die beim EU-Gipfel in Malta 2015mit dem Migrationsmanagement in der Regionbeauftragt wurde.
Dazu wollen mehrere afrikanische Staaten - darunter Ägypten, Kenia, Dschibuti, Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan, Südsudan, Äthiopien und Tunesien -Daten austauschen. Und auch die EU bekäme Zugang zu den Daten. Das Operationszentrum soll direkt in einer Polizeitrainingsstation in Khartum eröffnet werden - im Ibrahim Mahmoud Police Officers Training Institute.
Fünf Millionen Euro sind für ROCK vorgesehen, das Geld stammt aus dem EU-Treuhandfonds für Afrika. Nur ein Jahr nach dem Treffen in Paris soll soll das Zentrum im Herbst dieses Jahres eröffnen. Das gehtaus einer Antwortdes Bundesministeriums für Entwicklung und wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit (BMZ) auf eine Anfrage der Linken-Bundestagsfraktion hervor, die dem SPIEGEL vorliegt. Darin heißt es: "Nach Kenntnis der Bundesregierung soll nach derzeitiger Planung im November 2018 das ROCK seine Arbeit aufnehmen."
Fragwürdige Zusammenarbeit
Es ist Europas Versuch, die Migrationsabwehr an ein autoritäres Regime auszulagern, vor dem die Einwohner selbst fliehen: 3,7 Millionen Menschen sind nach Angaben von Amnesty International aus dem Sudan geflohen. Gegen PräsidentUmar al-Baschirliegt einHaftbefehl des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs vor.
Der Sudan ist aber auch ein wichtiges Transitland. Von hier aus versuchen Menschen aus Eritrea und Somalia nach Libyen und von dort übers Mittelmeer nach Europa zu gelangen. Das Regime geht hart gegen die Migranten vor: Immer wieder würden Asylsuchende an der Grenze zurückgewiesen oder pauschal inhaftiert,berichtet Amnesty International.
Sudans Präsident Umar al-Baschir
Die EU arbeitet mit dem Autokraten Baschir trotzdem schon länger zusammen.Mehr als 200 Millionen Eurosind seit 2015 für die Migrationsbewältigung in den Sudan geflossen. 46 Millionen an EU- und deutschen Geldern verwaltet die Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)im Programm "Better Migration Management". Der Fokus liegt auf dem Horn von Afrika, wo nach GIZ-Angaben rund neun Millionen Menschen auf der Flucht sind.
Bei den Planungen zu ROCK gab es immer wieder Rückschläge. Eigentlich wollten die vier Gründerstaaten ein Konsortium bilden und darüber ein schriftliches Abkommen schließen. In Paris lief im September 2017 schon ein Bewerbungsverfahren, gesucht wurde ein Projektkoordinator für ROCK. Im November teilte die Bundesregierung der Linken-Fraktion dann mit: "Deutschland wird dem Konsortium nicht beitreten."
Hatte Berlin etwa Gewissensbisse bekommen? Nicht unbedingt. Aus der BMZ-Antwort geht hervor, dassMenschenrechteoffenbar keine Rolle beim Rückzug aus dem Projekt spielten: "Die Bundesregierung hat sich aufgrund knapper personeller Ressourcen und Prioritätensetzungen in der Region dazu entschieden, keine Verpflichtungserklärung als Projektpartner abzugeben." Auch Frankreich, Großbritannien und Italien wollen nun kein gemeinsames Übereinkommen mehr. Stattdessen favorisieren sie "bilaterale Verpflichtungserklärungen". Das widerspricht nicht nur dem EU-Aktionsplan für ROCK - darin ist ein Konsortium mehrerer Mitgliedstaaten explizit vorgesehen. Zudem ist nun auch völlig unklar, wie ein Operationszentrum, das über zahlreiche bilaterale Verträge geschaffen wurde, zentral gesteuert und beaufsichtigt werden soll.
Bundespolizei kooperiert mit sudanesischer Polizei
Dennoch hält sich die Bundesregierung eine Beteiligung an ROCK weiterhin offen. Man verfolge die Eröffnung des Operationszentrums "aktiv", um möglicherweise später in Abstimmung mit den übrigen Teilnehmern "das eigene Engagement verstärken zu können", heißt es in dem Papier. Also kein Nein, sondern ein Vielleicht.
Bundespolizei und die sudanesische Polizei arbeiten ohnehin schon länger zusammen. Im Oktober 2016 etwa besuchte eine Delegation aus Khartum Berlin, die Reisekosten übernahm die Bundespolizei. Es wurde "eine Dokumenten- und Urkundenschulung durchgeführt", teilt das BMZ mit, das Ziel: "technische wie logistische Unterstützung sowie Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten". Das BMZ bestätigte auch, dass die Bundespolizei und die sudanesische Grenzpolizei Informationen über Urkundendelikte austauschen. Offenbar geht es auch hier um die Eindämmung von Migration:Flüchtlingearbeiten oft mit falschen Pässen, um außer Landes zu kommen. Und auch für das GIZ-Projekt "Better Migration Management" werden bereits Grenzbeamte geschult.
Amnesty International hält das für "problematisch". Denn im Sudan seien auch die Spezialkräfte RSF (Rapid Sudanese Forces) mit dem Grenzschutz beauftragt. Einige RSF-Offiziere sollen zuvor den paramilitärischen Dschandschawid angehört haben, die am Völkermord in Darfur beteiligt waren. Die RSF sind organisatorisch dem sudanesischen Geheimdienst NISS zugeordnet. Dass auch der Geheimdienst am Grenzschutz beteiligt ist, bestätigt das BMZ: NISS sei "als staatliche Behörde in den Bereich Migration eingebunden, insoweit seine gesetzlichen Funktionen betroffen sind".
Der europapolitische Sprecher der Linken-Fraktion, Andrej Hunko, kritisiert die Pläne für das Operationszentrum scharf. Die Zusammenarbeit von EU und Bundesrepublik mit dem Sudan sei ein "fatales Signal für die Wahlen in 2020", wenn Präsident Baschir wieder kandidieren wolle. "Hier werden Menschenrechte außenpolitischen Interessen geopfert", sagt Hunko.

In the past two days, members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have detained dozens of young people in Mellit town and reportedly shaved their heads.
The majority of detainees in the North Darfur town are secondary school students. Witnesses reported that they have had their heads shaved by the RSF members.
The shaving campaign, as residents name it, has created fear in the area. “Especially students are scared. Most of them have been forced to stay at home by their parents, out of fear of being beaten and shaved bald,” a witness told this station.
Residents have condemned and criticised the campaign.
In October last year, members of RSF militiamen alsoshaved a girl’s headwhen she was taking livestock for grazing in Kutum. They had discovered she belonged to the Mahameed clan.
In December, 83 youths and students in Sudan’s Northern State were convicted to beshaved in publicfor their “odd shaving and wearing inappropriate uniforms”, a town court ruled

In mid July, the West Darfur authorities announced “a comprehensive plan” to rid the state of illegal arms and vehicles. A High Committee for the Collecting of Arms and Unlicensed Vehicles was formed to implement the compulsory phase of the disarmament campaign that started in Darfur in August last year. A joint force of army and security troops are implementing the campaign.
The committee will also check the roads on unlicensed vehicles. For this purpose, check-points have been set-up at specific crossings.
The governor said he hopes to declare the state free of weapons soon.
Last year in July, the Sudanese government announced alarge disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan.
Members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan’s main government militia, and the army were tasked to collect illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians. In North Darfur alone, more than12,500 RSF troopswere deployed for this purpose.
The phase of the voluntary handover of weapons ended and compulsory collection began in end October. By then,about 30,000 weapons had been collected, out of an estimated 700,000 illegal weapons circulating in Darfur.
Moreover, sources told Radio Dabangain January this yearthat a number of militiamen in the region refused to return the weapons and Land Cruisers provided to them to carry out the disarmament campaign.They said that hundreds of militiamen took the vehicles to Libya and Chad, towards Niger. Others went southward.
In early May, Sudan's Second Vice-President, Hasabo Abdelrahman, announced there-enforcemnt of the disarmament campaignin Darfur.

Members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have reportedly stormed the police station in Tabit, North Darfur, to retrieve camels that were seized following damage to farms.
Several farmers told Radio Dabanga that they filed a complaint against the destruction of a vast area of farmland by camels near Tabit in Tawila locality.
Camel herders had driven the herds there to graze. The local police seized about 150 camels and took them to the police station.
A group of RSF members then stormed the police station to rtreive the camels under force of arms. A farmer said that the RSF drove two vehicles and were under the command of a RSF lieutenant. “The camels were freed in full view of the authorities,” he said.
There have been no reports of injuries.

Title: Joint UN-African Union mediator reports progress in Darfur peace talks | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Djibril Bassolé said the talks between the Government of Sudan and some rebel groups are “advancing well” and noted the inclusive nature of the peace process, with Darfur civil society, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, participating actively and constructively.
At the same time, he noted that the main Darfur rebel groups are not participating in the talks in the Qatari capital.
“The absence of both the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Movement of Abdel Wahid at the negotiation table and the ongoing fighting in Darfur are putting at risk the chances for a definitive and stable peace,” Mr. Bassolé said in a statement issued to the press yesterday after meeting in Juba with Sudan’s First Vice President, Salva Kiir Mayardit.
The mediator said he encouraged Mr. Kiir to help bring all remaining rebel groups to the talks.
He added that ongoing fighting in Darfur is putting at risk the chances for a definitive and stable peace, echoing what Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated in his latest report on the joint African Union-UN mission in Darfur, known asUNAMID.
Mr. Ban noted that violence flared between Sudanese Government forces and JEM in May, in breach of a cessation of hostilities agreement signed earlier this year, making May the deadliest month since the establishment ofUNAMID in 2007.
He urged the Government and JEM to immediately cease their ongoing military confrontations and commit to the peace process, stating that the rebel group’s withdrawal from the Doha talks has undermined the goal of a rapid resolution of the conflict.
An estimated 300,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million others have been displaced in the past seven years in Darfur due to fighting between rebels and Government forces backed by allied Janjaweed militiamen.

Title: UN, African Union to ramp up deployment of peacekeepers in troubled Darfur | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Additional troops are expected to arrive by March from Egypt, South Africa, Senegal and Bangladesh, and later this year, further troops will arrive from Nepal, Nigeria, Egypt and Ethiopia,UNAMIDsaid.
Tanzania has also announced it will send an entire infantry battalion of about 900 personnel and an advance party, including engineers crucial toUNAMID’s plan to expedite its deployment target.
The hybrid force was set up by theSecurity Councilto protect civilians on the western flank of Sudan, where an estimated 300,000 people have been killed and another 2.7 million have been forced from their homes since fighting erupted in 2003, pitting rebels against Government forces and allied Janjaweed militiamen.
Earlier this week in Addis Ababa, the UN, African Union and the Government of Sudan met to discuss ways of accelerating the deployment ofUNAMIDto reach the strength of 26,000 military and police personnel authorized by the Security Council.
At the end of the meeting, a Memorandum of Understanding on air operations was signed by the Government of Sudan and UNAMID to enable the latter to make a more effective use of the infrastructure of Sudanese airports to speed up the process.
In December, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that UNAMID deployment had been delayed by continued fighting between the parties on the ground and the slow provision of units and equipment previously pledged to the mission.
However, as the mission marked its first anniversary earlier this month, Mr. Ban confirmed that troop levels have exceeded 60 per cent of the full authorized strength.
One year on from transferring the task of suppressing the violence to UNAMID from the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS), some 12,374 blue helmets are now in place across Darfur, which is 63 per cent of the 19,555 authorized military personnel.
In addition, on 5 January, two new contingents of Nigerian police officers trained in high-risk operations joined the mission, bringing the total number of Formed Police Units (FPUs) serving with the mission to five, following the earlier arrival of units from Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal.

FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
UNAMIDfire fighters, assisted by blue helmets from Rwanda and Egypt and the State Airport Fire Brigade, eventually brought the fire under control without suffering any injuries.
The blaze caused an estimated $4 million worth of damage to communications equipment and another $1 million to other items, including office furniture and a water treatment laboratory.
In addition, 11 container offices and two warehouses were completely destroyed in the fire, which may have been sparked by an electrical short circuit, according to an initial assessment to be confirmed after a more thorough investigation.
UNAMID said that it has not been affected by the incident and that normal mission operations have resumed with minimal delay.
The hybrid force was set up by theSecurity Councilto protect civilians in Darfur, where an estimated 300,000 people have been killed and another 2.7 million have been forced from their homes since fighting erupted in 2003, pitting rebels against Government forces and allied Janjaweed militiamen.
More than one year on from transferring the task of suppressing the violence toUNAMIDfrom the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS), well over 12,000 of the 19,555 military personnel authorized by the Security Council are now in place across Darfur.

August 12, 2019 (JUBA) – A group of South Sudanese activists on Monday began a campaign to ensure the country’s warring parties meet the November 12 deadline agreed upon for the formation a coalition government.
Grouped under the civil society forum, more than 100 organizations started what they call a 90-day countdown to the formation of the long-awaited South Sudan Government of National Unity (GoNU).
The activist said they collaborate with the church to convince opposition groups that have not signed the September 2018 revitalized peace agreement to ensure they do so within the next three months.
The country’s rival parties, in May, agreed on a six-month extension to implement the next steps in the fragile peace agreement. The latest extension came after the main opposition group threatened to boycott formation of a unity government on May 12.
Speaking to reporters, Jackeline Nasiwa, the Executive Director for the Center for Inclusive Governance, Peace and Justice said the civil society groups and the church will form a coalition to engage non-signatories to embrace the agreement within the next three months.
“We need to ensure we reach all the forces that are still holding out and encourage them to be part of the peace process,” she said.
Nasiwa expressed concerns that some parties involved in the peace implementation process could abandon the initiative if the holdout opposition groups fighting the government are not included in it.
The General Thomas Cirilo-led National Salvation Front (NAS) and the South Sudan United Front led by former army chief of general staff, General Paul Malong Awan are the two main armed opposition groups that have not been included in the current peace process.
In September last year, South Sudan’s warring factions signed a revitalized peace agreement to end the country’s civil war. The revitalized peace accord stipulates that there shall be a transitional government formed after eight months of the pre-transitional period.
However, under the peace agreement, opposition leader Machar will be reinstated as South Sudan’s Vice President.
South Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of attempting a coup.

Title: What next for Sudan after Bashir’s nomination for a third term? | Omar al-Bashir | Al Jazeera
Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir’s insistence on holding on to power will have grave consequences for his country.
It seems Sudan’s PresidentOmar al-Bashirhas no intention of leaving the presidency in the near future – and his insistence on holding on to power will likely have grave consequences for his country.
On August 9,Sudan‘s ruling National Congress Party (NCP) announced that it would back Bashir as its candidate in the 2020 presidential election. The party’s advisory councilsaid it has endorsed the president for a third term after long consultations among the party’s leadership, even though the party charter – and the country’s constitution – allows only two five-year terms.
The party charter was swiftly amended on the day of the announcement but – at least on paper – there are two more hurdles that Bashir needs to overcome to be able to run for office in 2020.
First, Article 57 of Sudan’s constitution, whichstates that the president can only hold office for a maximum of two terms, needs to be amended by the parliament. Second, the NCP advisory council’s decision to endorse Bashir’s candidacy and amend the party charter needs to be approved by delegates at the party’s next convention.
Of course, both votes will be in name only –there is little doubt that the parliament and the NCP convention will endorse anything the totalitarian leader desires, and without much resistance.
Bashir is a scared man who still has near complete control over the ruling party, intelligence services and the country. Like any dictator who has stayed in power for multiple decades, and ruled with an iron fist, he knows that he can not leave the presidency without facing serious consequences.Furthermore, hewants to avoid facing the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide he committed in Darfur.His inner circle is as scared to lose power as he is, and collectively they are ready to use any means necessary to guarantee the continuation of their corrupt and violent rule.
I spoke to some NCP sources, on the condition of anonymity, about the advisory council’s August 9 announcement. They told me that the entire process was manipulated by Bashir’s inner circle and theNational Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).But while Bashir and his supporters clearly have a hold on the advisory council, there are some among the party cadres – especially in youth groups – that are vehemently against Bashir’s re-election.
For example, former presidential adviser and leading NCP figure Amin Hassan Omer has openlyexpressedhis opposition to the president’s reelection. Moreover, it is believed that many more among the NCP leadership are also not supportive of Bashir’s ambitions, but too scared to voice their concerns – such as former NISS directorand Bashir’s former senior assistant Nafie Ali Nafie (However, many believe Nafie and many other NCP figures who oppose Bashir are not genuine reformists and just want to increase their own power and wealth).
Furthermore, even though Bashir recentlyreshuffledthe Sudan Armed Forces (SAF)’s General Command,  to place his loyalists in positions of power, there are reports that most officers and foot soldiers do not support the president’s decision to run for a third term. Bashir alienated many in military cadres back in 2013, when he created a personal army, known as Rapid Support Force (RSF) militia.
In April this year, Bashirdeclared war oncorruption, in a bid to save the country’s collapsing economy.
In a strongly worded address to parliament, Bashir claimed a nexus between foreign currency traders, bankers and smugglers had damaged the economy, already weakened by US sanctions, corruption, mismanagement, armed conflicts and loss of oil revenues since a north-south split in 2011.
“These few people are controlling everything and they have networks in the banking system,” he told the lawmakers.
This was an unexpected move, as only two years earlier in 2016, when the parliament passed legislation that would have allowed anyone regardless of his/her official position to be prosecuted for corruption, Bashir refused to sign it. At the time, it was obvious to Sudan watchers that Bashir was reluctant to approve any anti-corruption legislation that may be used to target him and his inner circle.
So what to make of the president’s ongoing anti-corruption operation against so-called “regime fat-cats?”
Since the start of the operation – under the direction of NISS director Salah Abdalla Goash – several government officials, military officers, former NISS executives and executives from leading banks and companies have beeninterrogated or arrested. But none of the accused, so far, has been brought before the courts.
Hence it is evident to many that Bashir’s war on corruption is largely political and it serves two main purposes: first, to silence, intimidate and remove the regime’s top leaders who oppose Bashir’s re-election; second, to divert Sudanese people’ attention from the regime’s failures in addressing the country’s deep political and economic crises.
It is no secret that key Western countries would prefer Bashir to leave the presidency, as the ICC’s two-arrest warrants against the president are restricting their ability to directly deal with Sudan. However, they don’t appear to have a clear plan – or the political will – to force the veteran politician from power. On the contrary, the US and many of its European allies are still collaborating with Bashir on issues like counter-terrorism, regional security and curbing migration.
On the regional level, Bashir has played his cards well and managed to secure some support from some important players. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are using Bashir’s regime to help their efforts to win the war in Yemen and increase their dominance on the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa. Moreover, the ceasefire and power-sharing deals Bashir managed to broker between the warring parties in South Sudan also helped the Sudanese president increase his regional standing.
In this context, it is unlikely that many regional stakeholders or western powers  are going to react much to the announcement of Bashir’s candidacy for the 2020 elections. The African Union High-Level Implementation Panel for Sudan (AUHIP), led by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, is mandated to assist the stakeholders in Sudan to realise a comprehensive peace, but the panel has not been active recently and it is not expected to take any action regarding Bashir’s renewed political ambitions.
Now that Bashir has made his intention to stay in power for life crystal clear, he has two options: He will either rig the upcoming election to guarantee a victory, or he will find a way to renew his tenure, without holding elections.
Whichever path he chooses to follow, the Sudanese people will be the ones to suffer.There is a nationwide opposition to Bashir’s plans to stay in power. Many, including leading figures of Bashir’s own party believe that he is a liability. As result of one man’s insistence on holding on to power, and worsening political and economic crises, we may witness a nation-wide uprising, a coup or a violent power struggle between different groups within the regime in the near future.
Sudan needs urgent and meaningful help in order to evade total collapse and implosion. The international community needs to stop ignoring Sudan’s crisis and take constructive action.No doubt, real change in Sudan can only be realised by the Sudanese people.However,Sudan‘s crisis has regional and international dimensions and it can only be solved with the help of the international community. The establishment of aninternational mechanism that has a clear mandate to assist the stakeholders to achieve an inclusive and meaningful democratic transition of power can save the country from a grim future.

Title: Darfur: UN envoy vows to build momentum in peace process | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Jan Eliasson told reporters yesterday in Khartoum, after several days of talks and consultations in the Sudanese capital and other locations in the region with the Government, the movements and neighbouring countries, that the recent round of meetings has given the mediators extra energy to push towards a successful conclusion.
But he warned that “the negotiations do not exist in a vacuum. We also have to take into account the reality on the ground – the political reality that is also complicating our work.”
The consultations involving Mr. Eliasson and other UN and AU officials are the latest efforts of the two organizations to broker a comprehensive peace accord to quell the violence and humanitarian suffering in Darfur, where more than 200,000 people have been killed and at least 2.2 million others displaced since rebels began fighting Government forces and allied militia known as the Janjaweed in 2003. The situation has been complicated by the splintering of the rebel movements into more than a dozen separate factions and an increase in inter-tribal fighting.
The UN and AU are deploying a hybrid peacekeeping mission (known asUNAMID) to Darfur at the start of next year to take over from the existing but under-resourced AU mission (AMIS), but objections and obstacles raised by the Sudanese Government and a lack of offers for critical force units have left the deployment in jeopardy, senior UN officials have warned.
Mr. Eliasson said today that for the peace process to work, “I have come to the conclusion that we have to have the right developments on four different levels: theSecurity Council; the regional countries; the Government of Sudan and the movements. All four have to pull in the same direction. If we have a situation where one of these four circles is not pulling in the same direction, we do not seem to get peace.”
Direct negotiations between the Government and the movements are supposed to form the third phase of a three-part process that began with talks between the two sides in Sirte, Libya, in late October.
He noted that the improved climate in the Security Council and the growing cooperation of the regional countries means that the crucial issue has become whether the Government and the movements will head in the same directions on talks.
“We will do our very best to bring that about, but the environment in some regards is not conducive, and I hope that the Government of Sudan and the movements will take the responsibility to prepare for the talks to begin as soon as possible in the New Year.”

										#MeToo campaign for Sudanese teen highlights the need to end Western saviorism | Waging Nonviolence				
On June 27, Sudanese activists and the global human rights community declared victory when a 19-year old Sudanese woman, Noura Hussein,wasspared the death penalty. She was instead sentenced to a five-year prison sentence for murdering her husband in self-defense, as he tried to rape her when she was16 years old.
After news of the court’s initial decision for the death penalty broke in early May,Sudanese activists quickly took to Twitter and Facebookwith the hashtags #SaveNoura and #JusticeforNoura. Within a week, the story caught the attention of major international organizations like UN Women, Amnesty International and the EuropeanUnion, who allissued statementsagainst the ruling. A Sudanese diaspora blogger inspired aChange.org petitionthat received close to 1.7 million signatures worldwide. Celebrities like Rose McGowan, Emma Watson, Naomi Campbell and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Guillard alsoused their platforms to speak out.
Within a few weeks, a higher Sudanese court repealed the death sentence to a still-shocking five-year prison sentence.Sudan’s prisonsare known for their brutality and instances of unbridled torture.
The subsequent headlines from international media outlets described the win as a triumph of the international human rights community and the #MeToo movement over a waning Sudanese regime that has repressed its people for almost30years, eager to appease Western governments. Assuming the case was closed, international attention turned to other horrors.
Unfortunately, the case isn’t closed. It reemerged last week — registering only a blip on the international radar — when a government prosecutorfiled an appealto have Noura’s death penalty sentence reinstated. What’s more, Noura isn’t an isolated case.Wini Omer, a high profile women’s rights activist in Sudan who campaigned on behalf of Noura, was jailed for over a week around the time of Noura’s sentencing. A police officer arrested her because he simply “didn’t like the way she walked,” which led to charges of prostitution and crimes against the state. She now potentially faces capital punishment.
While the attention #MeToo brought to Noura’s case led to a positive outcome, the notion of “saving a life” without giving light to the structural causes that enabled her oppression in the first place must be called into question. “All of the assumptions [of Westerners] about women in theEast and Africa accidentally played a positive role in Noura’s case,” said Amgad Fareid Eltayeb, an activist with Sudan Change Now, the group that raised the profile of the initial sentencing. “Noura had a genuine cause, and the campaign had a victory. But what the campaign achieved is a small thing in the scales of [the abuses] that are actually happening,” he continued.
The Western human rights legal approach generally takes the horrors and injustices of the Nouras of the world case by case, with some harmful assumptions that create an “us” and “them” dynamic. Yet, there is far more interplay and collusion between Western governments and oppressive regimes like the Sudanese governmentthan face value might suggest. For example, the European Union hasfunneled millions of dollarsinto Sudan for “border security” in order to stop the flow of African migrants into Europe.These fundshave gone directly to the Rapid Support Forces, formerly known as theJanjaweed, which are the same militias that carried out ethnic cleansing campaigns in Darfur (in western Sudan) and who systematically use rape as a weapon of war.
The flash-in-the-pan activism of Noura’s case also begs some questions around the #MeToo movement’s ability to support long-term change and to truly challenge entrenched systems of racism, colonialism and patriarchy, especially when it comes to women in theGlobal South. While activism has become increasingly in vogue in the West, there is a danger that this mode of change simply replicates the same white (or Western) savior complex as the charity-driven humanitarianism that preceded it.
Western countries have flourished because of the violence and destructiontheycarried out to build their societies,and theycontinue to becomplicitbyfailingto take responsibility for this past. “The white man’s burden should notbe the motivation to act,”Eltayebsaid. “It should be the culpability of 400 years of colonization that stopped the progress of the civilizations in the Global South that led to the situation in our countries now.” Action driven by guilt can be fleeting, but action driven by a sense of conviction and obligation can put societies on much more equal footing.
“Sudanese activists, themselves raising the profile of this case, is what [got the attention of] international circles… Without them, Noura would not be here today,” Eltayeb continued.“Public opinion has begun to shift and recognize that, at least for cases like Noura, it was a clear act of self-defense. This creates openings for more debate, butno laws or policies changedas a result ofNoura’s case.”
Noura’s victory indicates that Sudanese activists are having some success changing the understanding of women’s rights domestically in a way that could enable more systemic change to take hold. The fact that Noura’s story spread so quickly on social and independent media outlets in Sudan is a testament to the effective, decentralized organizing of Sudanese activists, especially women.
Noura’s case became known because an audacious female journalist, Tahani Abbas,quietly followed her legal proceedings from the onset through the death penalty sentencing—interviewing her, visiting her in prison and risking her own safety to do so. The “No Oppression for Women” movement in Sudan stood ready to push out news of Noura’s case once the court made its ruling. The day of her death penalty sentencing, this women’s group also staged a sit-in in front of the court.
Other activist groups like Sudan Change Now helped amplify and spread the #SaveNoura and #JusticeforNoura messages. Opinion editorials, media articles and petitions followed, ultimately reaching an international audience.Thisin turnhelped expose new strategic openings for the domestic movement. “One of the lessons learned from this campaign is the regime’s growing concern of theirimage in the West. We can use this leverage in the future,” explained Fatima, who was active in Noura’s campaign (andwhosename has beenchanged for security).
But rather than coincidentally playing off each other, Sudanese and outside activists alike could coordinatemore intentionallyin the future. One place to start is recognizing that it is not simply an act ofgood will but an obligation to supportand work in partnership withNoura, Tahani, Wini, Fatima and the other Sudanese women on the frontlines. Their names should be known outside of Sudan so they can continue to be uplifted and recognized as heroes in theglobal #MeToo movement. They continue to risk their lives far after international attention deflects to other atrocities.
At the same time,Westerners are responsible for holding their governments accountable for perpetuating a system that allows these atrocities to happen. Otherwise, there will continue to be more Nouras of the world than social media can work to “save.” This will enable us to root our work, connect our struggles and pave a path towards more authentic solidarity.

Title: Genocide of Rohingyas in Myanmar Appears Almost Complete
This morning’s key headlines fromGenerationalDynamics.com
6,000 acres of Bangladesh land, valued at $86.67 million, have been deforested to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees. (United News of Bangladesh)
If a government wants to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing against an ethnic or religious population, then the old ways that our grandfathers’ generations used are no longer practical. Sending people to concentration camps and setting up an elaborate extermination system is way too expensive these days. And starving an entire population, as Stalin did to the Ukrainians in the 1930s and Mao did to the Chinese in the Great Leap Forward, could not be kept hidden from the global media as it was in those days.
Today’s generations of genocidal leaders have new, modern ways for a government to commit genocide now, and we have seen them practiced in Syria, Chechnya, Cameroon, and elsewhere. The basic technique is to make up some excuse to selectively target members of the group to be exterminated with bombs, missiles, jailings, rape, torture, and slaughter, saying that the people being targeted are ordinary criminals. Then when activists in the target group do something in retaliation, the government can declare the entire target ethnic group to be terrorists, including women and children, and use massive force to kill as many of them as possible, and force the rest to flee to other countries.
These new techniques appear to be spectacularly successful in Myanmar (Burma).
Since 2011, Burma’s mostly Buddhist security forces have been committing mass atrocities on mostly Muslim ethnic Rohingyas living in Rakhine State, in what the United Nations says is “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” and which some Western governments are calling genocide. The atrocities by Buddhist security forces include gang rape, violent torture, execution-style killings, and the razing of entire villages in a scorched earth campaign.
In August of last year, the Buddhist security forces got the excuse that they wanted, when a group of activists calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) armed with machetes killed several Burmese security forces in attacks against 30 Burmese police outputs. Using this attack as an excuse, the Burmese army began conducting massive slaughter and atrocities against the Rohingyas, causing hundreds of thousands to flee across the border into Bangladesh.
Today, there are about 700,000 Rohingyas living in refugee camps in Bangladesh: the world’s largest population of stateless people, not citizens of Burma, not citizens of Bangladesh.
The Buddhist army in Burma burned down Rohingya villages as part of the atrocities and, after the population left, the army bulldozed the villages. This was a purposeful act to make it impossible for the Rohingyas to return. Burmese authorities then claimed that the Rohingyas burned down their own villages, or even bulldozed them.
In September of last year, BBC reporter Jonathan Head was on a trip through Rakhine state sponsored by Burma’s government. The reporters were closely monitored by Burmese minders, but he happened to see smoke rising through the trees and was able to escape his minder and arrive at the village. Heinterviewed the Buddhists who were burning down the village,who said that they were helped by the Burmese police. He was able to see one house after another go up in flames, as the Buddhists burned them down.
It was really a pathetic sight. And yet we hear from Burmese officials that the Rohingyas burned down their own villages, and mainstream media dutifully report this as if it were some kind of reality.
Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel prize winner, has played an important role. She sweetly tells reporters, “Oh, it’s not so bad” or “No that’s wrong, it isn’t ethnic cleansing,” and so Aung San Suu Kyi is part of the genocide farce. She previously spent several decades under arrest by the army, but today it seems that the reason they let her go is because she promised to support the genocide.
Bangladesh and the international community are demanding that the Rohingyas be permitted to return to their homes in Burma. But that is impossible since the homes have been burned down and bulldozed.
Human Rights Watch has been interviewing Rohingyas who are newly arrived in Bangladesh. They report that the Buddhist security forces in Burma are still raping, torturing, mutilating, and killing Rohingyas.
The Burmese genocide and ethnic cleansing hashaveen wildly successful. They “cleansed” the area of hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas, who will no longer be around to ignore them. It is the modern way of doing things, and the results speak for themselves.ReutersandUnited News of BangladeshandDhaka TribuneandEconomist

Over the past few years, we have reported Generational Dynamics analyses of countries following exactly the same kind of pattern. The government targets an ethnic or religious population with rape, torture, jailings or other violence to provoke some kind of violent reponse, even an extremely minor one. Once that happens, the government declares the entire population to be terrorists and launches full scale genocide and ethnic cleansing.
After peaceful protests began in Syria in 2011, the country’s president Bashar al-Assad launched air attacks on women and children in schools and markets. Once there was a violent reaction, al-Assad could do what he wanted. He began by massacring thousands of innocent women and children in a Palestinian refugee camp in Latakia in August 2011. He used missiles and barrel bombs, including Sarin gas and chlorine gas, to kill his hated Sunni enemies and to destroy their homes, markets, hospitals, and schools. In 2015, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin joined in with his “Grozny strategy,” where warplanes attack hospitals, schools, and markets with the objective of creating millions of refugees, who can then be attacked while they are out in the open. Between the two of them, al-Assad and Putin have destroyed and flattened villages and cities and have forced millions of innocent Syrian civilians to flee the violence into Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and Europe. There are six million internally displaced refugees in Syria and five million that have fled to other countries, with 3.5 million in Turkey, almost one million in Lebanon, another million in Iraq and Jordan, and over a million in Europe.
Then, to complete the ethnic cleansing, al-Assad in April passed “Law #10,” which requires anyone wishing to return to Syria to provide paperwork immediately proving ownership of his or her property. The obvious intent is to make it impossible for these millions of people to return to their homes.
In Cameroon, the Francophone (French-speaking) government has used extremely repressive measures to marginalize the Anglophone (English-speaking) population in the region known as the Southern Cameroons. These government atrocitiesbegan in November 2016when the Francophone (French-speaking) Cameroon government security forces began beating and killing peaceful anti-government demonstrators in the Southern Cameroons. The demonstrators were protesting systematic bias, discrimination, and marginalization towards Anglophones by the Francophone government.
The government got what it wanted in November 2016 when Anglophone Cameroonians began peaceful protests. The Francophone security forces began violently attacking Anglophone protesters. In September of last year, activist separatists began using small bombs to target local security forces.
The government announced that “President Paul Biya has declared war on these terrorists who seek secession.” In the increasingly violent Francophone government crackdown that followed, hundreds of people were arrested and helicopter gunships were used to fire on innocent civilians and kill them. At least 5,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Nigeria to escape the violence.
In 2006, I wrote a generational analysis of the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, following the statement by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon thatthe Darfur genocide was caused by global warmingand therefore by America and Europe.
That fatuous reasoning led me to write an extensive generational analysis of what happened in Darfur, starting in the 1970s and continuing forward. That analysis is still correct, but I now realize that a part of it is in exactly the same pattern we have been talking about in Burma, Syria, and Cameroon.
In April 2002, a Darfurian farmer complained to the local authorities that they were being harassed by a local herder militia group. Instead of listening, the farmers were jailed. This had the effect desired by Sudan’s government. The farmers were infuriated, activists attacked a police station. The response from Sudan’s government was to unleash the Janjaweed militias for a full scale genocide of the Darfurians.

Plural news and views on Sudan
August 11, 2019 (JUBA) – The Kenyan special envoy for South Sudan, Kalonzo Musyoka has said there should be no further delays in the formation of the country’s coalition government due this November.
Kenyan special envoy for South Sudan, Kalonzo Musyoka meets President Salva Kiir in Juba, August 8, 2019 (PPU)Addressing reporters after meeting the South Sudanese President Salva Kiir on Thursday, Musyoka said his mission is to encourage the parties to achieve the November 12 deadline, without any delays.
The Kenyan opposition leader, who was appointed special envoy to South Sudan in July, said his consultative meeting with stakeholders’ and signatories to the revitalized peace agreement was to ensure by November 12, 2019, all the necessary arrangements are in place for the formation of the transitional government of national unity.
“We hope that everybody will agree that there is no need for further extension. We want to move from pre-transition to the transition period,” he stressed.
Musyoka said all pre-transitional arrangements should be completed within the extended timeframe parties agreed upon in May this year.
The coalition government was meant to be formed in May, but the parties agreed to extend the pre-transitional period for additional six months to enable them implement all the security arrangements.
Last week, body monitoring South Sudan’s ceasefire (CTSAMVM) expressed strong fears over the slow progress in the implementation of the security arrangements in the revitalized peace agreement.
The CTSAMVM is mandated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to monitor and verify the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities as per the peace deal.
South Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of attempting a coup.
However, in accordance with the September 2018 peace agreement, opposition leader Machar will be reinstated as vice president of South Sudan.

Title: Chikungunya fever reported in Sudan’s Kassala - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Health authorities in Kassala have confirmed the spread of viral fevers. The medical director of Kassala hospital, Dr Abdel Jabbar, said in a press statement that the hospital has refrained from receiving cases.
Health authorities in Kassala have confirmed the spread of viral fevers. The medical director of Kassala hospital, Dr Abdel Jabbar, said in a press statement that the hospital has refrained from receiving cases.
Doctors said that the fever in Kassala is called Chikungunya*,transmitted by mosquitoes of the Egyptian eugenics, for which there is no cure, with the treatment focused on alleviating the symptoms.
They said the disease is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, diabetics, and heart patients.
The residents confirmed to Radio Dabanga the overcrowding of the health centres in the various districts with patients, where El Borno district health centre is receiving about 150 cases a day.
They explained that the symptoms of the disease include severe fever accompanied with severe pain in the joints and difficulty of movement.
They reported the spread of the disease in the districts of West El Gash and El Halanga.
Strike
The doctors of El Obeid Hospital in North Kordofan entered a strike on Monday and Tuesday in protest against the attack on a hospital doctor by a member of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.
Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that one of the members of the rapid support militia slapping and kicked a doctor in the surgery department after a discussion between them.
The doctors conditioned lifting the strike with holding the rapid support militia member accountable.
In Khartoum, the Ministry of Health has acknowledged the increase in cases of kidney failure and the lack of medicine for kidney patients, especially Iberks.
The director of the planning unit of Kidney disease and general surgery programme has held the department of medical supplies responsible for the erratic provision of medication.
*Chikungunya Key facts (Source: WHO)
Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease first described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. It is an RNA virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. The name “chikungunya” derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning “to become contorted”, and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain (arthralgia).

Next:LEADERSHIP: It Takes More Than Two Percent
August 6, 2018:Yesterday another peace deal was agreed to for South Sudan and the deal was signed in Sudan, where all the principal faction leaders met to agree on the terms. There have been several of these deals since 2013 and all those failed but this one seems more likely to hold. The primary South Sudan rivals Salva Kiir (president of the country) and Riek Machar (former vice-president and rebel leader) signed a power-sharing agreement that deliberately worked to avoid past peace deals that failed. This one will end the civil war in part because everyone is resigned to the fact that the war is pointless and self-destructive. For example; Machar returns to being vice president, a job he was fired from in 2013 when Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. The peace deal was worked out with the help of many faction leaders and that meant a redistribution of high-level government jobs and creation of enough new posts to satisfy everyone, at least for now. For example, there are now five vice-presidents and 35 ministers (head of ministries). The parliament has been expanded to 550 members. All these new high-level jobs are an attempt to solve the problem that caused the civil war in the first place; tribal rivalries, jealousy, greed and paranoia. President Kiir belonged to the dominant Dinka tribe while Machar was a Nuer, the largest of many smaller tribes that accused the Dinka of taking more than their fair share of the goodies. South Sudan is a poor country but it does have some oil (five billion barrels, worth nearly $300 billion at current prices). Getting access to oil money often encourages political rivals to cooperate so that the oil can be pumped, shipped and sold. Yet South Sudan, even with oil income, is still an economic disaster. Peace is one thing, productive (rather than the usual plundering) government is another. Peace does not mean prosperity, just less deliberate killing.
August 3, 2018: The rainy season has begun in the Sudans. A downpour in central Sudan (North Kordofan state) destroyed 200 houses. In the west, a rainstorm in North Darfur took a similar toll. Torrential rains make movement on the ground very difficult. Many rural airfields are also shut down because cloud cover socks them in and the rain turns their dirt runways to mud. In South Sudan, foreign aid groups have already begun conducting air drops (via parachute) to deliver medicine and food. Aid groups know that the rainy season has made 70 percent of South Sudan “inaccessible” to ground convoys. This is a big problem as seven million South Sudanese are dependent on food and medical aid. The planes used to deliver by parachute can drop just over three tons of food per flight. A ton of rice (or other grains) can feed about 1550 to 1600 people per day at a subsistence level, so one plane can airdrop enough food to feed around 5,000 people a day. On a recent mission for a refugee camp in eastern South Sudan (Katdalok, Jonglei state), nine tons of food (three planeloads) were dropped over a two-day period. The camp houses some 5,000 refugees, so that was three days’ worth of food. But presumably, one planeload was consumed on the day it was delivered. Life hangs on a slender thread and fickle weather could delay future deliveries. What applies to the military applies to humanitarian aid: logistics, logistics, logistics. (Austin Bay)
August 2, 2018: Sudan and Ethiopia have begun a new border demarcation process intended to end disagreements over agricultural land rights along the border. Ethiopians and Sudanese have a specific over land in the Al-Fashaga area in Sudan’s Gedaref state (eastern Sudan).
Kenya will be the site got the next round of South Sudan peace negotiations. The two sides have not agreed to a general deal yet but key leaders are meeting in Sudan to try and work out a power-sharing agreement. If the Sudan talks succeed the September meeting in Kenya will work out additional details and address problems encountered so far.
August 1, 2018: South Sudan has informed Sudan that it expects to resume oil production in the El Toor and Toma South fields on September 2. The two fields will produce about 45,000 barrels a day. The oil will pass through Sudanese pipelines. Production from the Unity and Munga fields will begin by the end of December 2018.
July 31, 2018: The SSUM (South Sudan United Movement) rebels insisted they are still a member of the SSOA (South Sudan Opposition Alliance), which is the rebel political organization. SSOA leaders booted the SSUM because SSUM leaders had approved the latest transitional peace agreement between the South Sudan government and the main rebel group SPLM-IO. The SSOA says the deal does not sufficiently protect minority tribes in South Sudan or fairly share power. Nine political parties belong to the SSOA.
July 30, 2018: Sudan’s national intelligence agency announced it had conducted an operation that helped free five Egyptian Army soldiers kidnapped by an armed Libyan group (or Chadian gunmen operating from Libya). The rescue apparently took place inside of Libya.
July 26, 2018: The South Sudan government and SPLM-IO have signed another preliminary power-sharing agreement. South Sudan will create a transitional national legislature with 550 members. The government will have five vice-presidents. One vice-president must be a woman.
July 20, 2018: Egypt and Sudan have agreed to renew full diplomatic ties. They will also address their difference over Nile River water rights and a border dispute. The Egyptian Navy in the Red Sea has been supporting Saudi Arabian coalition operations in Yemen.
July 18, 2018: Much to the chagrin of Iran, Sudanese forces continue to serve with the Saudi Arabian-led coalition operation in Yemen. Sudan has all but terminated its long-term alliance with Iran and made it clear it will back the pan-Arab effort.
July 14, 2018: The South Sudan rebels (SPLM-IO) strenuously objected to the South Sudan parliament’s decision to extend President Salva Kiir’s term in office by three years. The SPLM-IO said the vote could undermine ongoing peace efforts.
July 13, 2018: The UN Security Council has imposed a tight arms embargo on South Sudan. The U.S. sponsored the resolution which received nine yes votes, the minimum number of votes required. The U.S., Great Britain, France, the Ivory Coast, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Peru, Poland and Sweden supported the resolution. Russia, China, Bolivia, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan abstained. The embargo includes a travel ban on key leaders and freezing of assets.
July 12, 2018: Sudan announced it will extend its unilateral ceasefire in the west (Darfur), central Sudan (South Kordofan) state and the southeast (Blue Nile state) until December 31, 2018. The problem is, the ceasefire is intermittently broken by both the government and rebels.
July 11, 2018: Today is the seventh anniversary of South Sudan’s independence. South Sudan has little to celebrate. The civil war began in December 2013 and continues. Out of a population of 13 million, 4.4 million South Sudanese are either refugees in foreign countries or internally displaced, Seven million South Sudanese need foreign aid (main food and medicine) to survive.
July 10, 2018: In southern South Sudan the SPLM-IO accused the army of attacking rebel positions in Yei River state. A force of around 200 soldiers left their camp at Morobo and attacked the rebel base in the town of Isebi.
July 9, 2018: In central Sudan three civilians were killed and six wounded when 18 soldiers attacked a group of herders in South Kordofan state. The soldiers stole over 60 head of cattle and 80 goats. The herders formed a posse and chased the soldiers, killing one soldier and wounding one. The cows and goats were recovered.
July 8, 2018: In western Sudan refugees entering the camp at Mershing (South Darfur state) report new fighting between government forces and rebels in the Jebel Marra area. The clashes occurred in Fundug Badiya (Central Darfur state). Subsequently, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM Abdelwahid faction) claimed its fighters killed 45 members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia. One rebel died in the firefight.
July 6, 2018: The Sudan president (Omar Al-Bashir) showed up in Djibouti (north of Somalia) to attend the China-Africa Economic Forum and Exhibition. Bashir remains under indictment by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The indictment was handed down in 2008 but the Moslem world, in general, prefers to ignore that sort of thing, if only because such bad behavior towards your own population is more common in Moslem majority states.
July 5, 2018: Diplomats in East Africa are saying the June 27 Declaration of Agreement signed in by South Sudan government and rebel leaders could result in a final peace settlement. However, the “permanent ceasefire” which was to take effect June 30 has already been broken by both parties. But the “Revised Bridging Proposal” that creates a process for forming a new transitional government and improving security arrangements has real promise. The government would form over a three-year transitional period. IGAD (East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development) would be closely involved. U.S. demands for a strict UN arms embargo on South Sudan are also a positive. Neither the government nor the rebels want to cross Washington. The Declaration’s oil production provisions benefit China, a permanent member of the Security Council which also has political and economic leverage in both Sudans. Oil royalties benefit both the government and the rebels in South Sudan. Sudan will behave because it gets oil pipeline fees. That’s the upside. Relentless genocidal civil war is the downside.

July 20, 2018: Egypt and Sudan have agreed to renew full diplomatic ties. They will also address their difference over Nile River water rights and a border dispute. The Egyptian Navy in the Red Sea has been supporting Saudi Arabian coalition operations in Yemen.
July 18, 2018: Much to the chagrin of Iran, Sudanese forces continue to serve with the Saudi Arabian-led coalition operation in Yemen. Sudan has all but terminated its long-term alliance with Iran and made it clear it will back the pan-Arab effort.
July 14, 2018: The South Sudan rebels (SPLM-IO) strenuously objected to the South Sudan parliament’s decision to extend President Salva Kiir’s term in office by three years. The SPLM-IO said the vote could undermine ongoing peace efforts.
July 13, 2018: The UN Security Council has imposed a tight arms embargo on South Sudan. The U.S. sponsored the resolution which received nine yes votes, the minimum number of votes required. The U.S., Great Britain, France, the Ivory Coast, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Peru, Poland and Sweden supported the resolution. Russia, China, Bolivia, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan abstained. The embargo includes a travel ban on key leaders and freezing of assets.
July 12, 2018: Sudan announced it will extend its unilateral ceasefire in the west (Darfur), central Sudan (South Kordofan) state and the southeast (Blue Nile state) until December 31, 2018. The problem is, the ceasefire is intermittently broken by both the government and rebels.
July 11, 2018: Today is the seventh anniversary of South Sudan’s independence. South Sudan has little to celebrate. The civil war began in December 2013 and continues. Out of a population of 13 million, 4.4 million South Sudanese are either refugees in foreign countries or internally displaced, Seven million South Sudanese need foreign aid (main food and medicine) to survive.
July 10, 2018: In southern South Sudan the SPLM-IO accused the army of attacking rebel positions in Yei River state. A force of around 200 soldiers left their camp at Morobo and attacked the rebel base in the town of Isebi.
July 9, 2018: In central Sudan three civilians were killed and six wounded when 18 soldiers attacked a group of herders in South Kordofan state. The soldiers stole over 60 head of cattle and 80 goats. The herders formed a posse and chased the soldiers, killing one soldier and wounding one. The cows and goats were recovered.
July 8, 2018: In western Sudan refugees entering the camp at Mershing (South Darfur state) report new fighting between government forces and rebels in the Jebel Marra area. The clashes occurred in Fundug Badiya (Central Darfur state). Subsequently, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM Abdelwahid faction) claimed its fighters killed 45 members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia. One rebel died in the firefight.
July 6, 2018: The Sudan president (Omar Al-Bashir) showed up in Djibouti (north of Somalia) to attend the China-Africa Economic Forum and Exhibition. Bashir remains under indictment by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The indictment was handed down in 2008 but the Moslem world, in general, prefers to ignore that sort of thing, if only because such bad behavior towards your own population is more common in Moslem majority states.
July 5, 2018: Diplomats in East Africa are saying the June 27 Declaration of Agreement signed in by South Sudan government and rebel leaders could result in a final peace settlement. However, the “permanent ceasefire” which was to take effect June 30 has already been broken by both parties. But the “Revised Bridging Proposal” that creates a process for forming a new transitional government and improving security arrangements has real promise. The government would form over a three-year transitional period. IGAD (East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development) would be closely involved. U.S. demands for a strict UN arms embargo on South Sudan are also a positive. Neither the government nor the rebels want to cross Washington. The Declaration’s oil production provisions benefit China, a permanent member of the Security Council which also has political and economic leverage in both Sudans. Oil royalties benefit both the government and the rebels in South Sudan. Sudan will behave because it gets oil pipeline fees. That’s the upside. Relentless genocidal civil war is the downside.

Title: Trois journalistes de médias indépendants arrêtés au Bélarus | Le Devoir
Trois journalistes ont été arrêtées mardi au Bélarus après des perquisitions dans les locaux de deux médias indépendants, accusés d’avoir utilisé sans abonnement les informations d’une agence de presse d’État, Reporters sans frontières dénonçant « des mesures d’intimidation ».
Deux journalistes du site d’informationTut.Byet une journaliste de l’agenceBelaPANont été incarcérées, a indiqué le Comité d’enquête bélarusse dans un communiqué.
Selon la même source, les deux médias sont soupçonnés de s’être connectés aux services de l’agence de presse BelTA, contrôlée par l’État bélarusse, sans payer cet accès.
« Nous ne sommes pas abonnés à BelTA, mais avec l’autorisation de cette agence, nous utilisons certaines informations de leur site en les référençant avec un lien hypertexte », a déclaré à l’AFP la rédactrice en chef de l’agence BelaPAN.
« Affirmer que nous en avons tiré profit, c’est tout simplement ridicule », a-t-elle affirmé.
Si BelaPAN et Tut.By sont reconnus coupables, les personnes arrêtées risquent jusqu’à deux ans de prison et une interdiction temporaire d’exercer leur profession, selon la loi bélarusse.
L’ONG Reporters sans frontières (RSF) a dénoncé dans un communiqué les perquisitions comme des actions « totalement disproportionnées au regard des accusations ».
« Difficile d’y voir autre chose que des mesures d’intimidation à l’encontre de médias indépendants de référence, dans un contexte de pressions accrues contre les voix critiques », a déclaré Johann Bihr, responsable de l’Europe de l’Est pour RSF, cité dans le communiqué.
Le Conseil de l’Europe a pour sa part appelé à une « enquête rapide et transparente » et à la libération des journalistes arrêtés.
Le porte-parole de la diplomatie bélarusse, Anatoli Glaz, a de son côté assuré que l’affaire n’était « nullement politique et n’a rien à voir avec la liberté de la presse ».
La maison d’édition Belorousskaïa Naouka est également visée dans la même affaire, ont précisé les enquêteurs, qui disent avoir enregistré en 2017 et 2018 au total plus de 15 000 connexions non autorisées aux services de l’agence BelTA, avec pour résultat « un préjudice important ».
Les responsables de Belorusskaïa Naouka, BelaPan et Tut.by « sont impliqués dans cette activité illégale », a affirmé le comité d’enquête.
Le Bélarus, dirigé d’une main de fer par le président Alexandre Loukachenko depuis 1994, maintient un contrôle constant sur les médias, durci notamment après des manifestations en mars 2017 qui ont mené à des centaines d’arrestations.
Le Bélarus figure à la 155e place au classement mondial de la liberté de la presse 2018 établi par RSF, qui y dénonce une « escalade de la répression » depuis 2017.

Plural news and views on Sudan
August 13, 2019 (JUBA) – South Sudan’s President, Salva Kiir and the British Foreign Office Minister for Africa, Andrew Stephenson on Tuesday to discuss the implementation of the 2018 peace accord.
The meeting took place in the South Sudanese capital, Juba.
The two leaders, president’s office said, discussed several issues, including the progress in the implementation of the revitalized peace deal and strengthening bilateral ties between the two nations.
“Andrew reiterated the United Kingdom’s commitment towards supporting the government and the people of South Sudan in achieving lasting peace and development for the country,” partly reads the statement from the presidency.
Stephenson is expected to meet other senior government officials and also visit British-funded projects in the world’s youngest nation.
Last month, the Troika, of which Britain is a member alongside Norway and United State, called for immediate implementation of South Sudan’s peace agreement signed in September last year.
The Troika, in a statement issued, also reaffirmed their full commitment to the peace process in the war-hit East African nation.
South Sudan plunged into civil war in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused the country’s former vice-president, Riek Machar, of plotting a coup.
In September last year, however, South Sudan’s arch-rivals signed a revitalized peace agreement to end the country’s civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million.
The country’s rival parties, in May, agreed on a six-month extension to implement next steps in the fragile peace agreement. The latest extension came after the main opposition group threatened to boycott formation of a unity government on May 12.

Title: Uganda Supports US Airlift Missions - 24Tanzania.com
ENTEBBE, Uganda, January 24, 2014–As U.S. airlift missions operating at the request of the French government and African Union authorities continue, Uganda maintains their role as a key U.S. strategic partner.In just two months, the Ugandans allowed the U.S. military to stage at least three essential missions out of Entebbe.“The Ugandans have been invaluable,” Col. William Wyatt, Office of Security Cooperation Uganda chief said. “Both the Civil aviation authority and Ugandan People’s Defense Force have been instrumental in helping us stage important missions out of Entebbe.”Most recently, the U.S. Air Force has been staging two C-17 Globemaster III aircraft out of Uganda to provide airlift support to a Rwandan mechanized battalion. The U.S. military is transporting equipment and soldiers to the Central African Republic in support of the African Union’s effort to confront destabilizing forces and violence.The ability to stage missions out of Uganda has been vital to mission success.“Every day we coordinate with the Entebbe Handling Service and they provide us with crew buses and maintenance towing capabilities,” said Maj. Micah Vander Veen Contingency Response Element Commander, and overall mission commander for the Entebbe stage. “They provide us with everything we need around the airfield, including security services.”The U.S. began the Rwandan airlifting mission January 16, 2014, and is scheduled to continue through the month.In December of last year, the U.S. staged a Burundi airlift mission out of Uganda in support of the same African Union operation. The duration of the operation was approximately 10 days.“With the rapid pace of events in East Africa the additional presence of the U.S. military was felt at Entebbe,” said Wyatt. “However the Government of Uganda was very helpful in allowing U.S. forces to conduct these important missions in support of the African Union for the Central African Republic and evacuation of noncombatants from South Sudan.”The most notable support the Ugandans have shown to the U.S. occurred when three CV-22 Ospreys were forced to divert to Entebbe after being fired upon, wounding four personnel onboard. The aircraft were attempting to land in Bor, to evacuate Americans from South Sudan.During this diversion the Ugandans were conducting their own noncombatant evacuation operations out of Juba, South Sudan.“When the U.S. had to emergency land in Entebbe, they were forced to occupy the only area on the airfield with lights,” said Wyatt. “It was difficult for the Ugandans to process their people in the dark.”The civil aviation authorities and Ugandan’s People Defense Air Force worked closely with U.S. Department of Defense authorities to make this mission and others a success.Uganda is located in the geographical heart of Africa and it is evident they have played a critical role in past and current operations.Vander Veen echoed positive sentiments as he spoke about the current airlift operation with the Rwandan soldiers, “Things are going extremely well, and the Ugandans have been strong partners in this operation.”

Title: Darfur: Ban deplores attack resulting in death of African Union-UN peacekeeper | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today strongly condemned an attack on an African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) convoy that resulted in the death of a peacekeeper, and appealed to Sudanese authorities to ensure that those responsible are held to account.
The convoy carrying civilian and military personnel was attacked on Monday evening by six to eight armed men in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.
“The Secretary-General calls on the Government of Sudan to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and to hold them accountable for this deadly attack,” his spokesperson said in astatement.
Mr. Ban called on all sides involved in the Darfur conflict to respect the integrity of the blue helmets, while underscoring the UN’s commitment to continue peacekeeping, mediation and humanitarian efforts in the war-wracked region on the western flank of Sudan.
UNAMID also called on the Sudanese authorities “to speedily investigate this wanton incident to bring the perpetrators to justice,” in a news release condemning the attack.
Initial reports say the men opened fire without warning on the convoy, which comprised three vehicles, and stole one of the vehicles. Three military personnel were injured and taken to the El Geneina hospital, and subsequently evacuated by helicopter to theUNAMIDhospital in Nyala, South Darfur, more than 300 kilometres from El Geneina.
“One of the peacekeepers succumbed to his injuries shortly afterwards,” the Mission stated.
A total of 5 UNAMID national and international civilian staff members, 2 non-UNAMID personnel, 13 military troops and 4 military police were involved in the incident, it added.
“UNAMID emphasizes that peacekeepers are in Darfur to assist in restoring peace and stability to the region. Any attack on peacekeepers is an attack on peace itself.”
Since January 2008, the Mission has been trying to quell the violence in Darfur, where an estimated 300,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million others displaced as a result of conflict pitting rebels against Government forces and allied Janjaweed militiamen since 2003.
So far 14 military personnel and three civilian police have been killed as a result of hostile attacks in the strife-torn region.
In addition, two of UNAMID’s civilian staff members were abducted from their home in the West Darfur town of Zalingei exactly one month ago. They have still not been released.

Title: RSF Criticizes Harsh Sentences For Staff Of Gonabadi Dervishes Website
Print
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has condemned the “extremely harsh” sentences that a Tehran Revolution Court gave last week to six staffers of the Majzooban-i Noor (Enchanted By Light) website.
The website is the only direct source of news and information about the Sufi religious community of Gonabadi dervishes in Iran.
According to RSF, “Two members of the website’s editorial committee, Salehoddin Moradi and Reza Entessari, and the latter’s brother, Sina Entessari, a citizen-journalist who wrote for the site, were sentenced to seven years in prison.”
Another citizen-journalist who reported for the site, Mohammad Sharifi Moghadam, and another member of its editorial committee, Kasra Nouri, were given 12-year terms. Mostafa Abdi, another member of the editorial staff, received the longest sentence of 26 years in prison.
Earlier, in an open letter from Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, four of the defendants had vowed they would not attend court hearings until the way was paved for a just and open trial.
“All six were also sentenced to 74 lashes each and, on completing their jail terms, to two years of internal exile and a simultaneous two-year ban on all civil society and journalistic activity,” RSF said. “The sentences were passed in absentia because the six refused to attend any of the hearings on the grounds that they had no legal representation and the trial was unfair.”
On February 16, for the second time in less than two weeks, security and intelligence agents swarmed Pasdaran Avenue in northern Tehran, where Tabandeh’s residence is located.
Gonabadi dervishes rushed to the scene to force the agents to leave.
After 7 a.m. on February 19, clashes broke out between the supporters of Tabandeh and security and Basij (the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ militia) forces.
Police special units supported by plainclothesmen attacked the protesters and battered dozens of dervishes.
Hundreds were arrested. Footage of dervishes with head injuries and broken teeth and jaws was widely circulated on social media. Three policemen and a member of the Basij were also killed.
Farhad Nouri, the Sufi community's spokesperson, told the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on February 23 that Kasra Nouri received a blow to the head that broke his skull and sent him into a coma for a while, but did not offer more details.
Furthermore, according to RSF, three of Majzooban Noor’s female citizen-journalists, Sepideh Moradi, Avisha Jalaleddin and Shima Entessari, were also sentenced by another branch of Tehran’s Revolutionary Court on July 10 to five years in prison on charges of “meeting and plotting against national security.”
“Rather than judicial decisions, these sentences are examples of how the Iranian judicial authorities persecute independent providers of news and information,” said Reza Moini, the head of RSF’s Iran/Afghanistan desk.
The Iranian regime has been cracking down harder on independent news providers ever since a wave of street protests began late last December in the Shi’ite holiest city in Iran, Mashhad, and soon spread to more than 100 cities across the country.
“We call on Javaid Rehman, the UN’s new special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, to take action on behalf of journalists who have been arrested arbitrarily and given unfair trials. The regime must adhere to its obligations to respect international standards,” Moini said.
RSF says the dervish citizen-journalists were tortured while being interrogated at Shapoor police station precinct and Evin’s Block 209.
Iran is ranked 164th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2018 World Press Freedom Index.

Title: Ban joins concern over fresh reports of bombings and fighting in Darfur | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
The joint UN-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur, known asUNAMID, has received reports this week that Sudanese military planes bombed an area near Kutum, a town in North Darfur state. Fresh clashes have also been reported in the area around Tine in West Darfur and along the border with Chad.
In astatementissued by his spokesperson, Mr. Ban said he takes the reports very seriously and he “calls on all parties to refrain from hostilities, to respect the spirit of the ceasefire recently declared by the Government of Sudan and to cooperate withUNAMIDin investigating these reports.”
Last week Khartoum announced an immediate ceasefire between its forces and the many rebel movements in Darfur, where fighting has raged since 2003 and led to the intervention ofUNAMIDto quell the violence and humanitarian suffering.
An estimated 300,000 people have been killed in Darfur over the past five years because of fighting between rebels and Government forces, while another 2.7 million people had to flee their homes.
The Sudanese military has been supported by militiamen, known as the Janjaweed, who have been accused of human rights abuses in their attacks on villages and other civilian targets.
The UN and AU’s Joint Chief Mediator for Darfur, Djibril Bassolé, is in the region this week as part of his efforts to try to re-energize the peace process.
While in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur and the headquarters of UNAMID, Mr. Bassolé has met with the leadership of the United Resistance Front (URF), a rebel group, and with Minni Minawi, a leader of a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA/M) and now an Assistant to the Sudanese President.
Meanwhile, the latestreportof the Panel of Experts established by theSecurity Councilto monitor the arms embargo in Darfur details how all parties to the conflict continue to carry out “flagrant violations” of the embargo.
“Within Darfur the actions of all sides make it clear that a military solution to the conflict has been chosen over any substantive engagement in peace talks,” the panel wrote. “Attempts to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table or to broker ceasefires have failed.
“The Darfur armed groups have further fragmented and insecurity continues to increase and is largely unaddressed. Offensive military over-flights continue with impunity and both the major armed groups and the Sudanese army have continued to carry out attacks.”
The panel recommends that the Security Council consider widening the embargo’s coverage to include the entire territory of Sudan and neighbouring Chad and northern Central African Republic (CAR) as well.
The group of experts also called for UNAMID and other peacekeeping or protection forces operating in the region to be given a more robust mandate and greater resources to better enforce the embargo, and for the panel’s capacity itself to be enhanced so that it can conduct more in-depth investigations into alleged violations.
