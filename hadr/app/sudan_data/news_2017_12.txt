By arresting Darfur’s powerful militia chief Musa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan’s strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to President Omar al-Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan’s counter-insurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
“This is a dangerous moment actually,” Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think-tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“By taking out Musa Hilal, they have pitched two different Darfuri Arab clans against each other.”
Hilal, the top leader of the Mahamid clan of Darfur’s biggest Arab tribe, the Rezeigat, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by other members of the broader Rezeigat tribe.
“This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning,” said Ahmed Adam, a research associate at London University.
“No doubt, Hilal’s arrest will impact the security and stability of Darfur.”
During the initial years of the Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003, Arab militias fought alongside government forces against the region’s black African rebels.
Hilal then led the government-allied Arab Janjaweed militia, notorious gunmen on horseback who swept through Darfur marauding villagers and fighting rebels who had taken up arms against Khartoum’s Arab-dominated government, accusing it of economic and political marginalisation.
The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and another 2.5 million displaced in the conflict.
The RSF has also been used to crush rebels in a brutal counter-insurgency launched by Bashir.
A joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed in 2007 to bring stability to Darfur — a vast region in western Sudan the size of France.
“The previous dynamic in Darfur was militia versus Darfur rebel groups violence,” Taylor said. “Now the most dangerous element is inter-Arab militia violence.”
Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for “human rights atrocities” during the early years of the conflict.

Title: Sudanese RSF extend weapons collection in Hilal’s hometown - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces will extend the deadline for the voluntary collection of illicit weapons in the area known as the stronghold of tribal militia leader Musa Hilal.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces will extend the deadline for the voluntary collection of illicit weapons in the area known as the stronghold of tribal militia leader Musa Hilal.
Yesterday the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) announced the seizure of 25 unlicensed armoured vehicles, a police vehicle that had been missing, two bunkers, a anti-aircraft gun, 12 Dushka machine guns and various other weapons in Misteriya in North Darfur.
People have received additional time to surrender their weapons voluntarily to the Sudanese army and RSF, before the latter starts with the mandatory collection of illegally held weapons.
Last week, Hilal, three of his sons and a number of his aides were capturedduring heavy clashesbetween the RSF and Hilal’s militias known as the Border Guards, in Misteriya.
The RSF second commander and brother of Hemeti, Maj. Gen. Abdelrahim Dagalo, addressed the residents of Misteriya together with the state’s security committee about militia leader Musa Hilal, whose stronghold and fighters are based in the area.
Hilal committed “a clear criminal act” by ambushing and killing RSF, Dagalo claimed. He called upon the residents to listen to the voice of reason and cooperate with the RSF.
The former janjaweed leader is a thorn in the side of Khartoum. In 2003, when the armed conflict erupted in Darfur, his janjaweed targeted unarmed people and torched villages of “African Darfuris” with full backing of the government. In 2006, the UN Security Council imposedfinancial and travel sanctionson him. Mid 2013 Hilal returned to North Darfur where his fighters, including the militiamen of the Border Guards, launched widespread attacks on government forces and allied militias.

Title: Sudan arrests sheikhs for arms possession in Central Darfur - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The Rapid Support Forces arrested nine imams and local leaders in Guldo locality in Central Darfur from Saturday to Monday on charges of the illegal possession of weapons.
The Rapid Support Forces arrested nine imams and local leaders in Guldo locality in Central Darfur from Saturday to Monday on charges of the illegal possession of weapons.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) arrested nine sheikhs, including three imams, from Fuldon and Joi in Guldo over the weekend. RSF members and 30 of their vehicles were stationed in Katlwa to carry out the weapons search.
Five sheikhs were arrested in Fuldon. Their names are Imam Mohamed Zakariya, Adam Musa, Imam Mohamed Adam Ibrahim, Sheikh Mohamed Adam Abakar, and Sheikh Adam Ishag.
In Joi, Sheikh Ishag Younis Abakar, Ismael Mukhtar, Imam Abakar Bhareldin and Abdelkarim Musa were arrested for the possession of arms.
Witnesses reported to Radio Dabanga that the RSF seized four people from their farms in the same period. Hawa Adam Tore, Khadija Adam Tore, Hawa Ibrahim Sanousi and Mohamed Abakar Omar have been taken them to an unknown destination.
Collection
The RSF and the Sudanese army have been put in charge of the mandatory collection campaign in which they seize illegally held weapons and vehicles. The campaign started in most states of Darfur in November. According to Sudan’s Second Vice-President Hasabo Abdelrahman the proliferation of weapons has become athreat to national security.
Speaking to Radio Dabanga in November, Prof Hamid Eltigani of the American University in Cairo commented that the voluntary and mandatory collection of illegal arms in Darfur states resulted in the capture of “only 30,000 armsout of the targeted 700,000 arms. Most were simply collected from the Sudan’s Popular Defence Forces [during the voluntary collection phase]”.
Eltigani said that the campaign faces a lack of funds to finance the process: in North Darfur alone,12,500 RSF troops and police have been deployed to assist with the arms collection and the controls of unregistered vehicles.
In addition, tensions arose between Darfur's notorious militia groups and Sudan's (para)military forces over the mandatory weapons collection. Defectors of the paramilitary Border Guards clashed with former Janjaweed leader Musa Hilal and his militias on 26 November. BothHilaland the defected Border Guards' leaderAli Rizgallah'Safana' have been captured and imprisoned.

Title: China commits $88 million in loans, grants to Sudan - Sudan Tribune

Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) shakes hands with Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 2, 2018. (Photo Xinhua).September 2, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – The Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to support Sudan to overcome its economic woes announcing his country would provide a 400 mln Yuan grant and a 200 mln Yuan interest-free loan to the East African nation.
The Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir has arrived in Beijing on Saturday to participate in the China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC). During his meeting with al-Bashir on Sunday, Xi Jinping said his country appreciates the harsh economic conditions that Sudan continued to suffer since the secession of South Sudan.
“China would cooperate with Sudan to overcome these difficulties and challenges,” said Xi Jinping according to the official news agency SUNA He pointed out that they would consider extending the grace period on China’s debt to Sudan, saying his government is keen to remove obstacles and create favourable conditions for cooperation between the two countries.
Beijing has complained recently over Sudan’s debt arrears that resulted from Khartoum’s purchase of China’s share of oil produced to cover domestic consumption.
The Chinese President said oil constitutes the backbone for cooperation between the two countries, stressing keenness to promote bilateral relations with Sudan.
China has been Sudan’s largest foreign investor, particularly in oil and telecommunications after western firms shunned the East African nation due to conflicts and sanctions.
It has invested more than $20 billion in Sudan mostly in the oil sector during the past two decades. Beijing provides low-interest loans and weapons transfers in return for oil.
Sudan hopes to attract new Chinese investments after Beijing had refrained from implementing a number of projects agreed with Khartoum following the latter’s failure to settle its debts.
Sudan’s total debt to China is estimated at $10 billion, accounting for about one-fifth of Sudan’s estimated $53 billion foreign debt.

Title: North Darfur governor: Arms collection far from successful - Dabanga Radio TV Online
Dabanga Radio TV Online
Independent news from the heart of Sudan
Dabanga Radio TV Online
The disarmament campaign in North Darfur has not led to the planned results, according to the state’s governor, although more than 170 militiamen affiliated with former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal have reportedly been arrested.Talking to a Darfur local radio on Saturday, Governor Abdelwahid Yousif Ibrahim acknowledged the small number of the weapons collected so far.He pointed to the spread of huge numbers of arms in North Darfur, and stressed that there is still a long way to go. He did not give exact numbers.
The disarmament campaign in North Darfur has not led to the planned results, according to the state’s governor, although more than 170 militiamen affiliated with former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal have reportedly been arrested.
Talking to a Darfur local radio on Saturday, Governor Abdelwahid Yousif Ibrahim acknowledged the small number of the weapons collected so far.
He pointed to the spread of huge numbers of arms in North Darfur, and stressed that there is still a long way to go. Out of an estimated 700,000 weapons believed to be in illegal circulation across Darfur, only 30,000 have been collected.
The governor told the North Darfur parliamenton 21 Novemberthat government forces collected 7,830 weapons, 240 four-wheel-drive vehicles for military use, and 287 other unlicensed vehicles so far.
On Sunday, the authorities in El Fasher began with the registration of Land Cruisers and double-cabin vehicles.
Arms collection, reform of militias
In July, Khartoum announceda large disarmament campaignin the country, to begin with in Darfur and Kordofan. Members of the Rapid Support Forces, Sudan’s main government militia, and the army began collecting illegal arms and unlicensed vehicles from civilians in the regions the following month.
At the end of October, the window for the voluntary handover of weapons ended and compulsory collection began. In North Darfur alone, more than12,500 RSF troopswere deployed to disarm civilians.
Darfuri government officials reported that 30,000 weapons have been collected during the voluntary phase. The number of illegal weapons in the region is estimated at about 700,000 pieces.
The campaignis to be followedby a reform of “the supporting forces of the army”, by which the various government militias will be dissolved. The members are to join the RSF.
Musa Hilal
The collection of firearms from the Popular Defence Forces and the Central Reserve Police militias happened as planned, but the government forces failed to collect weapons from the paramilitary Border Guards, affiliated with former janjaweed leader Musa Hilal.
In early October, Hilal's Revolutionary Awakening Councilwarnedfor serious unrest in the state, if the government forces would proceed to forcibly disarm his militiamen. However,Hilal, his sons, brothers, and many of his entouragewere arrested in a raid on his stronghold in North Darfur’s Kutum on 26 November.
The Governor of North Darfur told the local radio as well that 172 “serious criminals and outlaws” affiliated with Musa Hilal are currently being held at the Shala Prison in El Fasher amid tight security. They will be tried soon under the State of Emergency.
According to a report published by theEnough Projectin November, Darfur faces a dangerous military stand-off, with the disarmament campaign by Sudan’s government increasing the risk of armed conflict and mass violence.

Title: Militia boss arrest ‘dangerous moment’ for Sudan | Mena – Gulf News
With Hilal’s arrest, Khartoum sending signal to international community that it is ‘in control of Darfur’
KHARTOUM — By arresting Darfur’s powerful militia chief Mousa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan’s strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to President Omar Al Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan’s counter-insurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
“This is a dangerous moment actually,” Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“By taking out Mousa Hilal, they have pitched two different Darfuri Arab tribes against each other.”
Hilal, a powerful leader of the Mahamid tribe, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by members of another Arab tribe, Darfur’s biggest, the Rezeigat.
“This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning,” said Ahmad Adam, a research associate at London University.
“No doubt, Hilal’s arrest will impact the security and stability of Darfur.”
During the initial years of the Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003, Arab militias fought alongside government forces against the region’s black African rebels.
Hilal then led the government-allied Arab Janjaweed militia who swept through Darfur fighting rebels who had taken up arms against the Khartoum government, accusing it of economic and political marginalisation.
The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and another 2.5 million displaced in the conflict.
The RSF has also been used to crush rebels in a brutal counter-insurgency launched by Bashir.

‘Inter-Arab violence’
A joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed in 2007 to bring stability to Darfur — a vast region in western Sudan the size of France.
“The previous dynamic in Darfur was militia versus Darfur rebel groups violence,” Taylor said. “Now the most dangerous element is inter-Arab militia violence.”
Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for “human rights atrocities” during the early years of the conflict.
Khartoum now insists that the conflict has ended, and it has even launched a campaign to disarm militias operating there.
Analysts say the disarmament campaign is primarily aimed at weakening Hilal — who according to a UN report controls several gold mines in Darfur — after a rift with Khartoum.
“It is mainly about containing or liquidating Mousa Hilal, as well as targeting other black communities and the internally displaced persons,” said Adam, adding that Khartoum had armed these militias in the first place.
Up to 10,000 pro-government fighters led by RSF were mobilised to nab Hilal, who himself commands about 3,000 militiamen, sources said.
With his arrest, Khartoum is sending a signal to the international community that it is “in control” of Darfur, said Taylor.
“Hilal was the big one they wanted to take out. He was seen as becoming this over-mighty figure,” he said.
Although the overall violence has fallen in Darfur, a permanent peace deal between Khartoum and rebels has proved elusive.
With the fall in bloodshed, the UN-African Union peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMID, is now being downsized.
But Hilal’s arrest at a time when UN peacekeepers are scaling back has the potential to unravel much of the gains achieved in Darfur, a European diplomat said.
“This is quite troubling ... Musa Hilal is a very important shaikh who has tribal influence,” he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“This could trigger a lot of things, a lot of bad things, and UNAMID won’t be able to stop everything.”

August 9, 2018 (KHARTOUM) – The Consultative Council of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday unanimously approved a proposal to amend its constitution to nominate the party leader Omer al-Bashir for the upcoming elections.
The NCP constitution limits to two terms the nomination of the party candidate for the presidential elections.
Omer al-Bashir waveing hand in Istanbul. August 19, 2008 (AFP)However, in a meeting held on Thursday, the members of the Shura Council without opposition adopted an amendment abolishing presidential term limits, paving the way for al-Bashir to stay in power. for a third term.
The amendment enables Sudan’s ruling party, which remained silent over the al-Bashir’s nomination for 2020 elections, to overcome the first obstacle preventing his official nomination for the upcoming election.
However, to totally disarm any opposition for al-Bashir’s re-election, the party needs to amend the Sudanese constitution.
Several voices inside and outside the parties declared their opposition to his nomination for a new term during the past months, pointing to the NCP and Sudan constitutions.
In his speech before the Council which is the parliament of the party, al-Bashir didn’t comment on the amendment but spoke about the current economic crisis the country experiences and vowed to announce “quick and practical measures to overcome the current difficulties.
He praised the Sudanese people for their “responsible” handling of the crisis and called on the government and the NCP particularly to work hard to remediate the situation.
“Yes, we are part of the National Reconciliation Government, but the primary responsibility lies with the National Congress party, and all the issues facing the country are the responsibility of the NCP,” he said, adding “We must speak with transparency and honestly without lies.”

Title: Militia chief arrest 'dangerous moment' for Sudan's Darfur | News24
Thursday, 29 August
04 Dec 2017
Khartoum - By arresting Darfur's powerful militia chief Musa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan's strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to President Omar al-Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan's counter-insurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
"This is a dangerous moment actually," Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think-tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.

Hilal, a powerful leader of the Mahamid tribe, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by members of another Arab tribe, Darfur's biggest, the Rezeigat.
"This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning," said Ahmed Adam, a research associate at London University.

Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for "human rights atrocities" during the early years of the conflict.
Bashir himself is accused by The Hague-based International Criminal Court of genocide and war crimes related to the conflict, charges he denies.
Khartoum's use of scorched-earth tactics against ethnic minority rebels had also been a key factor for Washington to maintain a trade embargo against Sudan imposed in 1997.
Washington lifted the embargo on October 12, noting an overall fall in violence in Darfur since last year.
Khartoum now insists that the conflict has ended, and it has even launched a campaign to disarm militias operating there.

"It is mainly about containing or liquidating Musa Hilal, as well as targeting other black communities and the internally displaced persons," said Adam, adding that Khartoum had armed these militias in the first place.
"Musa Hilal was created by Bashir to carry out his counter-insurgency in Darfur... but recently he had become politically ambitious.

During the initial years of the Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003, Arab militias fought alongside government forces against the region’s black African rebels.
Hilal then led the government-allied Arab Janjaweed militia, notorious gunmen on horseback who swept through Darfur marauding villagers and fighting rebels who had taken up arms against Khartoum’s Arab-dominated government, accusing it of economic and political marginalisation.
The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and another 2.5 million displaced in the conflict.
The RSF has also been used to crush rebels in a brutal counter-insurgency launched by Bashir.
– ‘Inter-Arab violence’ –
A joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed in 2007 to bring stability to Darfur — a vast region in western Sudan the size of France.
“The previous dynamic in Darfur was militia versus Darfur rebel groups violence,” Taylor said. “Now the most dangerous element is inter-Arab militia violence.”
Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for “human rights atrocities” during the early years of the conflict.
Bashir himself is accused by The Hague-based International Criminal Court of genocide and war crimes related to the conflict, charges he denies.
Khartoum’s use of scorched-earth tactics against ethnic minority rebels had also been a key factor for Washington to maintain a trade embargo against Sudan imposed in 1997.
Washington lifted the embargo on October 12, noting an overall fall in violence in Darfur since last year.
Khartoum now insists that the conflict has ended, and it has even launched a campaign to disarm militias operating there.
Analysts say the disarmament campaign is primarily aimed at weakening Hilal — who according to a UN report controls several gold mines in Darfur — after a rift with Khartoum.
“It is mainly about containing or liquidating Musa Hilal, as well as targeting other black communities and the internally displaced persons,” said Adam, adding that Khartoum had armed these militias in the first place.
“Musa Hilal was created by Bashir to carry out his counter-insurgency in Darfur… but recently he had become politically ambitious.
“Thus, there is no love story between the two men.”
– Reduced UN forces –
Up to 10,000 pro-government fighters led by RSF were mobilised to nab Hilal, who himself commands about 3,000 militiamen, sources said.
With his arrest, Khartoum is sending a signal to the international community that it is “in control” of Darfur, said Taylor.
“Hilal was the big one they wanted to take out.. He was seen as becoming this over-mighty figure,” he said.
Although the overall violence has fallen in Darfur, a permanent peace deal between Khartoum and rebels has proved elusive.
With the fall in bloodshed, the UN-African Union peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMID, is now being downsized.
But Hilal’s arrest at a time when UN peacekeepers are scaling back has the potential to unravel much of the gains achieved in Darfur, a European diplomat said.
“This is quite troubling… Musa Hilal is a very important sheikh who has tribal influence,” he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“This could trigger a lot of things, a lot of bad things, and UNAMID won’t be able to stop everything.”

Title: Militia chief arrest 'dangerous moment' for Sudan's Darfur | Daily Mail Online

Musa Hilal (C), a powerful militia and Arab tribal leader in Sudan's strife-torn Darfur who was arrested last week by counter-insurgency
By arresting Darfur's powerful militia chief Musa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan's strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to President Omar al-Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan's counter-insurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
"This is a dangerous moment actually," Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think-tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.
"By taking out Musa Hilal, they have pitched two different Darfuri Arab clans against each other."
Hilal, the top leader of the Mahamid clan of Darfur's biggest Arab tribe, the Rezeigat, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by other members of the broader Rezeigat tribe.
"This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning," said Ahmed Adam, a research associate at London University.

Title: Militia chief arrest 'dangerous moment' for Darfur | Pulselive Kenya
By arresting Darfur's powerful militia chief Musa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan's strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to PresidentOmar al-Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan's counter-insurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
"This is a dangerous moment actually,"Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think-tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.
"By taking out Musa Hilal, they have pitched two different Darfuri Arab clans against each other."
Hilal, the top leader of the Mahamid clan of Darfur's biggest Arab tribe, the Rezeigat, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by other members of the broader Rezeigat tribe.
"This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning," said Ahmed Adam, a research associate at London University.
"No doubt, Hilal's arrest will impact the security and stability of Darfur."
During the initial years of the Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003, Arab militias fought alongside government forces against the region's black African rebels.
Hilal then led the government-allied Arab Janjaweed militia, notorious gunmen on horseback who swept through Darfur marauding villagers and fighting rebels who had taken up arms against Khartoum's Arab-dominated government, accusing it of economic and political marginalisation.
The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and another 2.5 million displaced in the conflict.
The RSF has also been used to crush rebels in a brutal counter-insurgency launched by Bashir.
'Inter-Arab violence'
A joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed in 2007 to bring stability to Darfur -- a vast region in western Sudan the size of France.
"The previous dynamic in Darfur was militia versus Darfur rebel groups violence," Taylor said. "Now the most dangerous element is inter-Arab militia violence."
Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for "human rights atrocities" during the early years of the conflict.
Bashir himself is accused by The Hague-based International Criminal Court of genocide and war crimes related to the conflict, charges he denies.
Khartoum's use of scorched-earth tactics against ethnic minority rebels had also been a key factor for Washington to maintain a trade embargo against Sudan imposed in 1997.
Washington lifted the embargo on October 12, noting an overall fall in violence in Darfur since last year.
Khartoum now insists that the conflict has ended, and it has even launched a campaign to disarm militias operating there.
Analysts say the disarmament campaign is primarily aimed at weakening Hilal -- who according to a UN report controls several gold mines in Darfur -- after a rift with Khartoum.
"It is mainly about containing or liquidating Musa Hilal, as well as targeting other black communities and the internally displaced persons," said Adam, adding that Khartoum had armed these militias in the first place.
"Musa Hilal was created by Bashir to carry out his counter-insurgency in Darfur... but recently he had become politically ambitious.
"Thus, there is no love story between the two men."
Reduced UN forces
Up to 10,000 pro-government fighters led by RSF were mobilised to nab Hilal, who himself commands about 3,000 militiamen, sources said.
With his arrest, Khartoum is sending a signal to the international community that it is "in control" of Darfur, said Taylor.
"Hilal was the big one they wanted to take out.. He was seen as becoming this over-mighty figure," he said.
Although the overall violence has fallen in Darfur, a permanent peace deal between Khartoum and rebels has proved elusive.
With the fall in bloodshed, the UN-African Union peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMID, is now being downsized.
But Hilal's arrest at a time when UN peacekeepers are scaling back has the potential to unravel much of the gains achieved in Darfur, a European diplomat said.
"This is quite troubling... Musa Hilal is a very important sheikh who has tribal influence," he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"This could trigger a lot of things, a lot of bad things, and UNAMID won't be able to stop everything."

Non-profit arts studio Tashkeel launched this annual initiative with the intention of supporting budding designers in the UAE. This year, three talents were chosen from hundreds of applicants to be a part of the sixth creative development programme. These are architect Abdulla Al Mulla, interior designer Lana El Samman and graphic designer Yara Habib.
The trio have been guided by experts from the industry over the course of nine months, as they developed their own products that merge their unique styles with traditional elements of Emirati design. This includes laboratory sessions, experimental and collaborative practice, investigation of new business models and evaluation.
It is led by British contemporary design project specialist Helen Voce and mentor Kevin Badni, and offers participants access to experts from across the world, including the likes of UK designer Gareth Neal and multidisciplinary designer and entrepreneur, Sheikh Salem Al Qassimi.
The final pieces are being revealed in a worldwide limited-edition release on the first day of Downtown Designs at Dubai Design Week 2019. Tashkeel will be at stand E31 at the exhibition.
Lisa Ball-Lechgar, deputy director of Tashkeel, said: “The diversity and calibre of the applicants this year … is reflective of the dynamic change that the UAE art and design industry is witnessing, with young creators resolute in making their bold design ideas a reality.”

Title: Arrest of Darfur militia chief 'could spark fresh violence' | The Malaysian Insight

BY arresting Darfur’s powerful militia chief Musa Hilal, Khartoum has tightened its control over Sudan’s strife-torn region but analysts say it might open a new chapter of violence.
Hilal, a former aide to President Omar al-Bashir, was arrested last week by Sudan’s counterinsurgency forces near his hometown of Mustariaha in North Darfur state after fierce clashes that left several dead.
“This is a dangerous moment actually,” Magnus Taylor, Sudan analyst with the think tank International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“By taking out Musa Hilal, they have pitched two different Darfuri Arab tribes against each other.”
Hilal, a powerful leader of the Mahamid tribe, was captured by a unit of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by members of another Arab tribe, Darfur’s biggest, the Rezeigat.
“This is the start of intra-fighting, this is only the beginning,” said Ahmed Adam, a research associate at London University.
“No doubt, Hilal’s arrest will impact the security and stability of Darfur.”
During the initial years of the Darfur conflict that erupted in 2003, Arab militias fought alongside government forces against the region’s black African rebels.
Hilal then led the government-allied Arab Janjaweed militia, notorious gunmen on horseback who swept through Darfur, marauding villagers and fighting rebels who had taken up arms against Khartoum’s Arab-dominated government, accusing it of economic and political marginalisation.
The United Nations says hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and another 2.5 million displaced in the conflict.
The RSF has also been used to crush rebels in a brutal counter-insurgency launched by Bashir.
‘Inter-Arab violence’
A joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed in 2007 to bring stability to Darfur – a vast region in western Sudan the size of France.
“The previous dynamic in Darfur was militia versus Darfur rebel groups violence,” Taylor said.
“Now the most dangerous element is inter-Arab militia violence.”
Hilal is subject to a United Nations travel ban and on a list of individuals sanctioned for “human rights atrocities” during the early years of the conflict.
Bashir himself is accused by The Hague-based International Criminal Court of genocide and war crimes related to the conflict, charges he denies.
Khartoum’s use of scorched-earth tactics against ethnic minority rebels had also been a key factor for Washington to maintain a trade embargo against Sudan imposed in 1997.
Washington lifted the embargo on October 12, noting an overall fall in violence in Darfur since last year.
Khartoum now insists that the conflict has ended, and it has even launched a campaign to disarm militias operating there.
Analysts say the disarmament campaign is primarily aimed at weakening Hilal—who according to a UN report controls several gold mines in Darfur  – after a rift with Khartoum.
“It is mainly about containing or liquidating Musa Hilal, as well as targeting other black communities and the internally displaced persons,” said Adam, adding that Khartoum had armed these militias in the first place.
“Musa Hilal was created by Bashir to carry out his counter-insurgency in Darfur… but recently he had become politically ambitious.
“Thus, there is no love story between the two men.”
Reduced UN forces
Up to 10,000 pro-government fighters led by RSF were mobilised to nab Hilal, who himself commands about 3,000 militiamen, sources said.
With his arrest, Khartoum is sending a signal to the international community that it is “in control” of Darfur, said Taylor.
“Hilal was the big one they wanted to take out.. He was seen as becoming this over-mighty figure,” he said.
Although the overall violence has fallen in Darfur, a permanent peace deal between Khartoum and rebels has proved elusive.
With the fall in bloodshed, the UN-African Union peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMID, is now being downsized.
But Hilal’s arrest at a time when UN peacekeepers are scaling back has the potential to unravel much of the gains achieved in Darfur, a European diplomat said.
“This is quite troubling… Musa Hilal is a very important sheikh who has tribal influence,” he told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“This could trigger a lot of things, a lot of bad things, and UNAMID won’t be able to stop everything.” – AFP, December 3, 2017.
