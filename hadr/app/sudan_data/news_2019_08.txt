Forty years ago, an Iowa newspaper published a column about Sudan titled 'Impoverished Land of Richness,” written by a recent Drake graduate (me) serving as an intern at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan. Later, I became a U.S. diplomat and eventually served as ambassador to Sudan's neighbor, Eritrea. When two rebel groups in eastern Sudan signed a peace treaty with Khartoum, I organized a series of workshops to strengthen civil society in former rebel communities in eastern Sudan. My interest in Sudan has remained high, as our son Owen taught in Khartoum for four years. Meanwhile, thousands of Sudanese have moved to Iowa, becoming our neighbors.
The foreboding I felt for Sudan in 1979 was borne out, unfortunately. The Sudanese people have suffered civil war, secession, genocide, oppression, and decades of kleptocracy. When Sudan's strongman Omar al-Bashir, indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, was ousted after mass protests in April, investigators found millions of dollars' worth of cash stuffed into suitcases at his residence.
The massive public demonstrations in Khartoum were led by educators, women, doctors and other professionals. After the dictator's downfall, protesters were outraged when Bashir's henchmen announced they were now in charge.
Then, on June 3, troops opened fire on protesters, killing scores of unarmed civilians in what some called 'Sudan's Tiananmen.” In the wake of the June 3 mass murders, foreign mediators helped forge a power-sharing agreement for a three-year transition to democracy. The temporary ruling council comprises six civilians and five soldiers, with a military officer in charge for the initial 18 months.
The situation is very unstable; several coup attempts have been foiled. The security forces are divided into three camps: regular military, secret police, and the thuggish paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF arose from the Janjaweed militia that spearheaded Bashir's genocidal campaign in Darfur; its leader is a gangster who controls gold mines in Darfur and received millions for supplying gunmen to the Saudi-backed side in Yemen's civil war. The Janjaweed widely employed rape as a weapon of war and practiced ethnic cleansing in Darfur.
The RSF's leader, Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemeti” Dagolo, is the most powerful commander in Khartoum today. He is feared and loathed by many Sudanese. Should the rule of law come to Sudan, Hemeti could be indicted for war crimes. Thus, he has every reason to hold on to power.
What can the United States do? Professional diplomats may be able to use traditional diplomacy free of tweets and political grandstanding to persuade the Sudanese commanders to yield power. American diplomats should highlight trade, aid, investment, the exchange of ambassadors and the lifting of the 'state sponsor of terrorism” status once the transition is complete. Sticks include reimposing crippling financial and trade sanctions should the commanders balk. Responsible generals need to sideline Hemeti and marginalize the RSF.
Prospects for democracy, human rights and the rule of law are at a crucial juncture. We need to support the Sudanese people.

Title: Sudan paramilitary funnelling weapons into Central African Republic, UN report reveals | Middle East Eye
Sudan's notorious Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary has been selling weapons and military equipment to rebels from the Central African Republic, fuelling a military buildup that could threaten the country's peace process, according to aUN report.
The RSF's commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, commonly known as Hemeti, also met with Khartoum-based CAR militia leader Noureddine Adam several times in 2019.
Since the turn of the year, when a huge protest movement began in Sudan, Hemeti has been positioning himself as one of the country's most powerful leaders and had a key role in the removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir.
Groups previously part of the Seleka coalition of rebels, who forcibly took power in CAR in 2013, have been buying weapons and pickup trucks from the RSF, despite signing peace agreements with the government, according to the report published at the end of July.
"FPRC [The Popular Front for the Rebirth of CAR] and UPC [Union for Peace in CAR] have continued to acquire weapons, ammunition and pickup vehicles from and/or through Sudanese territory, with the complicity of elements from the Rapid Support Force," said the report authored by a panel of UN experts.
According to the report, former Seleka groups purchased pickup trucks in Sudan's western Darfur region between January and May 2019. Darfur borders CAR and is the birthplace of the Janjaweed militia, from which the RSF was formed.
The report details how several CAR rebel groups travelled between the Darfuri towns of Nyala and Birao, across the border in to the Central African Republic, to buy vehicles, assault rifles, grenade launchers, ammunition and uniforms.
Dozens of machine gun-mounted pickup trucks were spotted in Birao in January 2019, as rival groups displayed their replenished arms stocks. The RSF deployed 60 vehicles of fighters to the border at the time.
According to the report, the rebels claimed they were acquiring weaponry to prepare for potential government offensives against them.
Exiled Sudanese broadcaster Radio Dabanga has previously reported thatRussian forces have trained former Seleka rebels from a base near the border in south Darfur.
The UN report also notes that Russian military instructors had been involved in the transfer of "material" from Sudan into CAR.
The largely Muslim Seleka fighters were accused of abuses against CAR Christians during their military offensive on the capital Bangui in 2013, which prompted a backlash by rival "anti-Balaka" militias that targeted Muslims.
The Associated Press news agency estimated that more than 5,000 people had been killed in the conflict by September 2014.
In February, the CAR government signed a peace agreement with 14 militias in Khartoum, but there have been concerns about how to disband the militias or absorb them into regular forces.
Violence has continued, however, and the UN report raises concerns about the potential for further violence, as groups continue to acquire weapons from the RSF and traffickers in Chad.

Hemeti, the dominant figure in the military council, tells the BBC he will abide by the deal
Sudan's ruling military council and civilian opposition alliance have signed a landmark power-sharing deal.
The agreement ushers in a new governing council, including both civilians and generals, to pave the way towards elections and civilian rule.
Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagolo, widely regarded as Sudan's most powerful man, has pledged to abide by its terms.
Sudan has seen pro-democracy protests and repression since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was ousted in April.
The deal was signed by Hemeti and Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan for the military council, and Ahmed al-Rabie for the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella group of pro-democracy protesters.
The prime ministers of Ethiopia and Egypt and the South Sudanese president were among regional leaders attending ceremony.
Many hope the deal will lead to civilian government after decades of army rule
There were scenes of wild celebrations on the streets of the capital, Khartoum, after the ceremony.
Thousands of cheering people gathered around the convention hall where the documents were signed, waving Sudanese flags and flashing peace signs.
Khartoum residents and people from other parts of the country came in on buses and trains for the occasion.

Under the deal, a sovereign council, consisting of six civilians and five generals, will run the country until elections.
The two sides have agreed to rotate the chairmanship of the council for just over three years. A prime minister nominated by civilians is due to be appointed next week.
"We will stick to every single letter we have agreed on," Hemeti told BBC HARDtalk's Zeinab Badawi in an interview broadcast ahead of the ceremony.
"Even without the agreement, we [would] have to work in this direction because it's in the country's interest," he added. "Therefore we have to carry out the agreement, stick to it and support it."
Hemeti is the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militia that was accused of carrying outa genocide in the Darfur region of western Sudan.
Many people stood outside the RSF headquarters in central Khartoum, playing revolutionary songs and chanting at soldiers in celebration, Reuters news agency reports.

What happened during the 3 June massacre?
The RSF have been blamed for recent abuses, including the 3 June massacre during which more than 120 people were reportedly killed, with many of the dead dumped in the River Nile.
RSF leaders have denied planning the killings, which they say were carried out by rogue elements.
Asked about the massacre in the BBC interview, Hemeti said there had been "systematic plotting and conspiracy" to tarnish the reputation of the RSF, whom he described as "protectors" and not killers.
The unrest in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when then President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures.
Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards, and the anger spread to the capital.
The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years.
In April, the president was overthrown by the military after sit-ins outside the defence ministry, but demonstrators then wanted to ensure authority was swiftly transferred to a civilian administration.
A council of generals led by Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan assumed power, but it has struggled to return the country to normality.
The army is not a unified force in Sudan; paramilitary organisations and various Islamist militias hold some sway.

Title: Sudan’s ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir faces corruption trial – The Irish Times
On Sunday, Sudan’s ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir will begin a trial on corruption charges, something dismissed by many of his victims and human rights groups as a “sideshow”.
Bashir – who was forced out of power in April, following months of protests – is accused of “possessing foreign funds, acquiring suspected and illegal wealth and ordering [the state of] emergency”.
The trial is expected to last weeks or months.
"I think most people think it's not the most heinous crime committed by Bashir or his political officials," said Ahmed Elzobier, Sudan researcher for Amnesty International. "Most are concerned about the crimes in Darfur especially: war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, that's why we call for them to hand him over to the International Criminal Court to face these charges."
For legal reasons, Bashir can’t be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity in Sudan, Mr Elzobier said. “Legally in Sudan he could get away with it. Sudan at the moment is not prepared to charge Bashir with these war crimes.”
Musa Siddiq, a 28-year-old refugee from Darfur, said he still believes Darfuris can get justice. "Bashir has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Darfur, the Nuba mountains, the southern Blue Nile," Mr Siddiq told The Irish Times.
“He must to go to the ICC, and his partners who stood with him and committed crimes against humanity . . . must to go to the court too.”
Conflict erupted in Darfur in 2003. According to United Nations estimates, up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million displaced. The Janjaweed, the miltia responsible for mass atrocities, have since been incorporated into Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have held control in Sudanese capital Khartoum since Bashir was overthrown on April 11th.
Suffering continues in Darfur, Mr Siddiq said. Even now property is being confiscated by the RSF and people are being made homeless.
“Now Darfur faces its biggest nightmare disaster, that’s the RSF giving our houses to [a] new settlement.”
Mr Elzobier listed other crimes he says Bashir also needs to be prosecuted for, including Sudanese protesters being killed in the 1990s, and again in 2013. “Nothing happened to the people who were involved in that excessive use of force,” the Amnesty International researcher said.
Almost 80 protesters were killed more recently, in the months between protests erupting in December 2018 and Bashir’s removal in April. A thousands-strong sit-in protest in Khartoum was eventually violently broken up in early June.
On Saturday, Sudan’s main opposition group is due to sign a political agreement with the military council. On Sunday, they will name the members of a new leading sovereign council, and a new prime minister will be appointed on Tuesday.
Mr Elzobier said there were mixed feelings among Sudanese civilians about this. “Some people are happy and many are not happy . . . Some people completely reject what’s happening, saying this is a betrayal of the protesters and those who died. [They] don’t want the military involved. There are some people accepting that as a kind of compromise.”

Title: Sudan arrests paramilitaries for pupils' killing amid new deaths
Sudan's ruling generals announced Friday that nine paramilitaries had been arrested for the killing of four teenage demonstrators earlier this week after four people were killed protesting their deaths. The move against the feared paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces came as talks between protest leaders and the ruling generals on a promised transition to civilian rule were due to enter a second day. "An investigation has been launched into the incident of Al-Obeid and seven members of the RSF were immediately dismissed and handed over to civilian judges for trial," General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the ruling military council, told reporters. "Yesterday (Thursday), two more RSF members were arrested, so a total of nine have been detained." The fatal shooting of the four schoolchildren and two other demonstrators during a rally against fuel and bread shortages in the city of Al-Obeid on Monday has sparked angry protests in cities across Sudan. On Thursday, four protesters were shot dead in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, just across the Nile from Khartoum, doctors said. The protest movement has long blamed the irregulars of the powerful RSF, whose commander General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo is deputy head of the ruling military council, for the deadly violence against demonstrators. But after Monday's shooting, a fellow member of the military council, General Jamal Omar, too blamed the paramilitaries, who sprang out of the Janjaweed militia notorious for alleged war crimes during the conflict in Darfur. Speaking to Egypt's Al-Ghad television and other media during a tour of Al-Obeid, Omar said RSF fighters guarding a nearby bank had initially used batons to try to stop the protesters gathering. "This action led to a reaction from some students who threw stones at the forces," Omar said. "This made some members of the force act in their individual capacity to open fire on protesters. We have identified those who fired live ammunition that led to the killing of the six."

Title: Sudan arrests paramilitaries for pupils' killing amid new deaths - Digital Journal
Hi, what are you looking for?

Published
Sudan's ruling generals announced Friday that nine paramilitaries had been arrested for the killing of four teenage demonstrators earlier this week after four people were killed protesting their deaths.
The move against the feared paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces came as talks between protest leaders and the ruling generals on a promised transition to civilian rule were due to enter a second day.
"An investigation has been launched into the incident of Al-Obeid and seven members of the RSF were immediately dismissed and handed over to civilian judges for trial," General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the ruling military council, told reporters.
"Yesterday (Thursday), two more RSF members were arrested, so a total of nine have been detained."
The fatal shooting of the four schoolchildren and two other demonstrators during a rally against fuel and bread shortages in the city of Al-Obeid on Monday has sparked angry protests in cities across Sudan.
On Thursday, four protesters were shot dead in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, just across the Nile from Khartoum, doctors said.
The protest movement has long blamed the irregulars of the powerful RSF, whose commander General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo is deputy head of the ruling military council, for the deadly violence against demonstrators.
But after Monday's shooting, a fellow member of the military council, General Jamal Omar, too blamed the paramilitaries, who sprang out of the Janjaweed militia notorious for alleged war crimes during the conflict in Darfur.
Speaking to Egypt's Al-Ghad television and other media during a tour of Al-Obeid, Omar said RSF fighters guarding a nearby bank had initially used batons to try to stop the protesters gathering.
"This action led to a reaction from some students who threw stones at the forces," Omar said.
"This made some members of the force act in their individual capacity to open fire on protesters. We have identified those who fired live ammunition that led to the killing of the six."

Title: The notorious militia leader seizing control of Sudan's future | Middle East Eye
Hemeti dangled an apology to his audience. He had spoken too much and would finish soon. But the answer from the crowd of Darfuri sultans was a chorus of disagreement: they wanted more from the man who has become arguably the most powerful figure in Sudan.
The one-time Janjaweed militia commander was lauded at every possible opportunity during a recent iftar event held for the sultans - tribal leaders who, unlike the Darfuri people Hemeti is accused of waging a war against on behalf of the Sudanese government, are established allies of his.
Whenever his name was mentioned during the event, it was always in full and accompanied by his title – Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, vice president of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) – and met with ululating, as a single hoarse voice somewhere in the back barked the name of the notorious paramilitary group Hemeti leads, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
When he arrived at the garish banqueting hall in Khartoum hosting the dinner, the first task was a collective prayer for Sudan and a request for God to bless Hemeti.
It was all part of a charm offensive launched by a man who started out as a camel trader, became a militia leader and now, in the Sudan that has emerged after three-decade ruler Omar al-Bashir was ousted on 11 April, appears to be positioning himself as a potential leader of the country.
Though second in command within the military council that now rules Sudan, and its only member not to come from the Sudanese army, Hemeti is also the most visible of its leaders. He appears and speaks publicly more often than the TMC's president, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
Throughout Ramadan, Hemeti has used such evening fast-breaking iftar events held by his own supporters or soldiers to address the nation. Using elaborate camera set-ups broadcasting live, the general has shared his thoughts on the ongoing stand-off between the council and protesters who have occupied the area outside the military headquarters for almost two months demanding a civilian government.
"He's trying to depict himself as a man of the people, as a populist," said Khalid Medani, associate professor of political science and Islamic studies at Montreal's McGill University.
Medani told Middle East Eye that while Hemeti's strategic capabilities have been underestimated because of his lack of formal education, he is in fact positioning himself to preserve the system left behind by Bashir, despite protesters' demands for civilian rule.
"It wasn't unlikely that there would emerge a figure from the previous regime who would basically try to upgrade authoritarianism by offering some semblance of civilian rule but at the same time making sure the remnants and the most important institutions of the old regime would remain," he said.
Hemeti has spoken regularly about the ongoing negotiations between the military council and protest leaders, aimed at delivering a transitional joint military and civilian authority, but he has also taken on a diplomatic role far removed from his days as a militia leader.
The military council's social media accounts regularly show him meeting Khartoum-based ambassadors. At the iftar for Darfuri sultans, he welcomed the Saudi and US envoys. To ensure coverage, his team called Khartoum's hotels to alert the international media of his appearances.
Last week, Hemeti flew to Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, while Burhan visited Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Between them, the two managed over a couple of days to meet the three nations most supportive of the military council and most despised by the protesters, who accuse these countries of interfering in Sudan's revolution.
Since the protests began in December, Hemeti has put forward two images of himself - the champion of the protesters and the person to keep them in check - sometimes simultaneously.
On 25 December, in the first week of the protests and on the day of the first major demonstrations in Khartoum, he live-streamed on Facebook a speech given to his troops from the back of a pick-up truck in a dusty field, announcing his support for the protesters.
The reaction from the public, however, was still one of suspicion given his record in Darfur, where the RSF’s predecessor, the Janjaweed militias, were involved in a government campaign that killed at least 200,000 people, according to the UN.
The militias, primarily composed of Darfuri Arab fighters, were deployed by Khartoum to fight against rebels in the area. But the Janjaweed were accused of instead targeting civilian non-Arab tribes withexecutions, torture and rape.Hemeti was made leader of one of the largest Janjaweed militias in 2003, and then took command of the RSF when those militias were formalised in 2013, rising through the ranks as a reward for his loyalty to Khartoum while other Janjaweed leaders rebelled.
His forces have since been deployed against other rebellions in Sudan, including in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state, and have taken on anti-migration operations funded by the European Union, though they have themselves also beenaccused of facilitating smuggling.
Even after his December speech wooing the protesters, his forces were reportedly involved in crackdowns that killed dozens of protesters. Since rising to power within the TMC, Hemeti has repeatedly spoken about not accepting "chaos" from the protesters.
When protest leadersannounced a general strikethat has halted Sudan's private and public sectors this week, to pressure the military into striking a deal for a new balance of powers, he warned: "Whoever strikes, by God, they should go home."
In the same week, in an interview with Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram, he said negotiations were going well and the military council intended to hand over power as soon as possible.
"When the people's movement reached its peak, I decided to align with it," he told the newspaper. "The Sudanese people appreciated this position and praised the Rapid Support Forces for siding with the masses."
In reality, protesters at the sit-in outside the military headquarters do not share that perception of Hemeti.
On 13 May, forces dressed in the uniform of his RSF opened fire on the sit-in outside the country's military headquarters, where protesters have been camped out for two months, killing six and injuring more than 200. The next day, signs at the protest read: "RSF is the Janjaweed, and Hemeti is a new Bashir."
In Khartoum, residents often identify Hemeti's RSF forces by the supplies they always have stocked in the back of their pick-up trucks, readying them to be dispatched to any part of the country at short notice to deal with insurgencies and opposition.
The sight of those trucks, baskets of rocket-propelled grenades hanging in the open, has become more common in Khartoum since Bashir's removal. Many see it as a sign of Hemeti's power.
Though Burhan leads the TMC, Medani believes the two are "very, very close" and that "they work in tandem". The scholar points to their long-standing working relationship, which started in Darfur and most recently involvedrecruiting soldiers sent to fight in Yemen.
Medani said Hemeti may have even pushed for Burhan to become the leader of the TMC, to guard against his own opponents within the military - many of whom dislike Hemeti's forces, which they see as militiamen more than soldiers.
And while Hemeti has recently tried to display his political abilities, some question whether a man more used to using violence will be able to deal with the challenges he is likely to face from opponents or the protesters.
Despite denying his forces were involved in the deadly 13 May attack near the sit-in, protesters have repeatedly blamed them for other incidents of troops firing, including against a march from southern Khartoum to the sit-in this week.
"Hemeti’s success is really in the battlefield, he devised a new form of insurgency tactic that outdid the Sudan military," said Medani. "That is a very different dynamic to confronting a popular protest...a form of organisation he doesn't even understand."
"He’s having a problem figuring out how to campaign against this."

Title: Support courageous Sudanese people with strong U.S. diplomacy
Forty years ago the Des Moines Register published a column about Sudan entitled “Impoverished Land of Richness” written by a recent Drake graduate (me) serving as an intern at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan.
Later I became a U.S. diplomat and eventually served as ambassador to Sudan’s neighbor, Eritrea.  When two rebel groups in eastern Sudan signed a peace treaty with Khartoum, I organized a series of workshops to strengthen civil society in former rebel communities in eastern Sudan.  My interest in Sudan has remained high, as our son Owen (also a Drake graduate), taught in Khartoum for four years, departing earlier this summer.  Meanwhile, thousands of Sudanese have moved to Iowa, becoming our neighbors and fellow Iowans.
The foreboding I felt for Sudan in 1979 was borne out, unfortunately.  The Sudanese people have suffered civil war, secession, genocide, oppression and decades of kleptocracy.  When Sudan’s strongman Omar al-Bashir, indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, was ousted after mass protests in April, investigators found millions of dollars’ worth of cash stuffed into suitcases at his residence.
The massive public demonstrations in Khartoum were led by educators, women, doctors and other professionals; world opinion was galvanized by the iconic photo of Sudan’s “Lady Liberty,” student Alaa Salah, addressing a crowd of protesters from atop a car.  After the dictator’s downfall, protesters were outraged when Bashir’s henchmen announced they were now in charge.  Widespread protests resumed.
Then, on June 3, troops opened fire on protesters, killing scores of unarmed civilians in what some called “Sudan’s Tiananmen.”  In the wake of the June 3 mass murders, foreign mediators helped forge a power-sharing agreement for a three-year transition to democracy.  The temporary ruling council comprises six civilians and five soldiers, with a military officer in charge for the initial 18 months.
Time to give three cheers for People Power in Sudan?  Not yet.  The situation is very unstable; several coup attempts have been foiled recently.  The security forces are divided into three camps:  regular military, secret police and the thuggish paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).  The RSF arose from the Janjaweed militia that spearheaded Bashir’s genocidal campaign in Darfur; its leader is an uneducated gangster who controls gold mines in Darfur and received millions for supplying gunmen to the Saudi-backed side in Yemen’s civil war.  The Janjaweed widely employed rape as a weapon of war and practiced murderous ethnic cleansing in Darfur.
The RFS’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemeti” Dagolo, is the most powerful commander in Khartoum today.  He is feared and loathed by many Sudanese.  Should the rule of law come to Sudan, Hemeti could be indicted for war crimes.  Thus, he has every reason to hold on to power.  Will the security forces abide by the power-sharing agreement?  Not if Hemeti feels he can undermine it with impunity.
What can the United States do?  As the White House probably views Sudan as just another “sh**hole country,” professional diplomats may be able to use traditional diplomacy free of Tweets and political grandstanding to persuade the Sudanese commanders to yield power according to the transition plan.  American diplomats should highlight trade, aid, investment, the exchange of ambassadors and the lifting of the “State Sponsor of Terrorism” status once the transition is complete.  Potential sticks include reimposing crippling financial and trade sanctions should the commanders balk at giving up power.  Responsible generals need to sideline Hemeti and marginalize the RSF if a normal military relationship is to be established.
Prospects for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Sudan are at a crucial juncture.  We need to do what we can to support the courageous efforts of the Sudanese people in their endeavor by means of focused, muscular, and quiet diplomacy.
Ron McMullen, a native of Northwood and a graduate of Drake University, served as U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea and now teaches at the University of Iowa.

Title: Key Sudanese military leader promises to abide power-sharing agreement - Times of Oman
Darfur: Bringing a much-needed halt to over four months of unrest in the region, a key military leader in Sudan has promised to abide by a power-sharing agreement with the opposition.Mohamed Hamdan ‘Hemeti' Dagolo - widely regarded as Sudan's most powerful man - made the pledge in an interview as the two sides prepared to sign the landmark deal later on Saturday.The deal's aim is to end months of unrest and pave the way for civilian rule."We will stick to every single letter we have agreed on," Hemeti said in the interview."Even without the agreement we [would] have to work in this direction because it's in the country's interest," he added. "Therefore we have to carry out the agreement, stick to it and support it."Pro-democracy protests and violent repression gripped Sudan after long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was ousted.Under the new deal, a sovereign council, consisting of six civilians and five generals, will run the country until elections.The two sides have agreed to rotate control of the council for just over three years. A prime minister nominated by civilians is due to be appointed next week.Hemeti is the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militia that was accused of carrying out a genocide in the Darfur region of western Sudan.The unrest in Sudan began in December 2018, when then President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures.Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards and the anger spread to the capital.The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years.In April, the president was overthrown by the military after sit-ins outside the defence ministry, but demonstrators then wanted to ensure authority was swiftly transferred to a civilian administration.

Title: Nine Sudanese soldiers detained - defenceWeb
Sudan’s military council spokesman said nine soldiers from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the country’s most powerful paramilitary group, were dismissed and detained in connection with the killing of protesters last week.
Lieutenant General Shams El Din Kabbashi added the governor of North Kordofan state and its security council would be held accountable for the killing of six people, including four schoolchildren, in state capital El-Obeid.
The country’s main opposition coalition, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), welcomed the action against the RSF members, saying it would prevent further violence.
Representatives of the FFC and the council gathered to continue negotiations over a constitutional declaration that started on Thursday, state news agency SUNA said
Formerly known as the Janjaweed, the RSF fighters armed with assault rifles, machine guns mounted on trucks and rocket-propelled grenades are widely feared. They were hardened by war in Darfur against rebels who rose up against government.
Opposition groups accused the RSF, led by the deputy head of Sudan’s Transitional Military Council, of killing protesters demanding a return to civilian rule since President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in April.
The RSF commander, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, denied the claims and blamed “infiltrators”.
Thousands of Sudanese took to the streets last week in response to the El-Obeid killings and opposition medics said four more protesters were killed and othersinjured by gunfire in Omdurman. Kabbashi said authorities were pursuing those suspected of involvement in the Omdurman deaths.
His remarksat a press conference followed a night of negotiations with opposition groups over a constitutional declaration, a document that would pave the way for a transitional government.
Both sides signed a political deal in July setting a three-year transition period and a joint sovereign council. Talks over the constitutional declaration were called into question by violence last week before being reconvened.
“The agreement is now just around the corner,” Satea al-Hajj of the FFC said as talks restarted.

Title: Little hope for Sudanese refugees fleeing violence in Darfur
"In the beginning there were planes bombing the area. In November 2003, the Janjaweed came. There were rapes, beatings. They killed my father and stole our cattle," he says, referring to the Arab militias recruited by Omar al-Bashir's government to crush an ethnic minority rebellion in Darfur.
Rebels accused Bashir's government of marginalising the region. The insurgency was suppressed with brutal force.
According to UN estimates, the Sudanese government's brutal counter-insurgency campaign in Darfur has left at least 300,000 people dead and 2.7 million displaced since 2003.Human rights investigationshave revealed how Darfuri civilians have been systematically targeted for murder and rape.
"I fled to Chad with my mother and my sisters. I spent 10 years living in a refugee camp called Iridimi," says Ahmed. In 2014, he left the refugee camp and sought asylum in Jordan.
When the uprising against Omar al-Bashir's government started in December last year, Ahmed had been living in Amman as a refugee for nearly five years.Like most of thearound 6,000Sudanese refugees in Jordan, he followed the protests closely online.
Ahmed was appalled when he saw videos of the violence unleashed on protesters in the street s of Khartoum on June 3. But he was not exactly surprised.
The images and videos of men dressed in fatigues beating and intimidating unarmed protesters looked painfully familiar. Darfur had come to Khartoum.
On June 3, security forces broke up protests in Khartoum in an operation that, according to the Central Committee of Medical Doctors, left 128 people dead. Areportprepared by state prosecutors only confirmed 87 deaths.
Bodies werethrown into the Nileand hospitalsreported over 70 rapes.Protesters blamed the violence on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), formed from the former Janjaweed militias accused of crimes against humanity in Darfur.
"We have been experiencing this kind of violence for over 16 years," says Adam, a Darfuri refugee who fled Sudan in 2013 and also sought asylum in Jordan.

The Janjaweed militias were sent to attack Darfuri villages as part of a brutal campaign that led Bashir to be indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Criminal Court.
Like Adam and Ahmed, many Darfuri refugees saw the crackdown on protesters in Khartoum as a continuation of atrocities committed in Darfur.Already too familiar with the brutality of the Janjaweed, refugees from Darfur argue that the violence used recently against protesters has been perpetrated by the same forces. Formed from the former Janjaweed militia, the RSF have been accused ofwidespread human rights abuses.
A week after the attack on protesters,Amnesty Internationalsaid that Sudanese government forces, including the RSF and allied militias continue to commit war crimes and human rights violations in Darfur.
"In the past year these have included the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings, and sexual violence," Amnesty International's report read.
But human rights activists say that unlike the violence on June 3 in Khartoum, which was filmed by protesters and widely shared online, ongoing violence in Darfur remains largely undocumented and brutality continues to be used against civilians with impunity.
"In our region nobody has the money to buy a smartphone. We don't have the same kind of access to the internet to post photos and videos," says Adam. "This type of things has been going on for a very long time. But no one is interested in reporting on it."
Adam fled his village in 2004 and spent four years in a refugee camp called Kalma in southern Darfur. With around 90,000 residents, Kalma was one of the largest camps for Darfur's displaced people.
Adam says his camp was attacked by paramilitary forces associated with the Janjaweed in August 2008."They came and surrounded the camp, 35 people were killed and over one hundred people were wounded," says Adam, adding that the incident was barely reported. He says thatRadio Dabanga, an Amsterdam-based radio, is one of the few news outlets regularly reporting on human rights abuses in Darfur.
"My wish for Sudan is total civil governance," writes Adam on a white paper he holds in front of his face. He still fears for his safety so he chose not be identified [Marta Vidal]
Adam fled conflict at home but he did not find peace in Amman. Sudanese refugees in Jordan oftencomplain of discrimination and feel neglected by humanitarian organisations and local authorities. Despite being unable to work, they receive limited humanitarian assistance.
Jordan hosts the world's second highest number of refugees per capita, and overburdened NGOs tend to focus on Syrian refugees who are the majority. So many Sudanese refugees in the country are left to fend for themselves.
Sudanese refugees' hopes and fears
Triggered by economic collapse, protests started in the northeastern city of Atbara in December but quickly spread across Sudan. Protesters demanded an end to Bashir's three-decade authoritarian rule.
On April 6, protestersoccupied the squarein front of the military headquarters. Five days later the military arrested Bashir and announced the formation of a Transitional Military Council. But protests continued to call for the transfer of power to civilian rule.
"Bashir's regime has survived under the new political landscapes in Sudan but without the big boss at the head of it. The system that he created turned against him," says Suliman Baldo, a senior policy adviser at US-based NGO the Enough Project."These generals want to retain their power and preserve the system that Bashir created."
The Transitional Military Council (TMC) is led by lieutenant general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but its most prominent member is general Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemeti, the leader of the RSF.
Hemeti's forces have been deployed to crush insurgencies across Sudan, and its mercenaries are also fighting in Yemen as part of the Saudi-led coalition.
"There is no trust," says Abdel, who fled Darfur in 2010 and became a refugee in Jordan. "Hemeti is responsible for the killing of Darfuris for many years and now he is in the centre, dominating the TMC."
For Sudanese refugees in Jordan, Bashir might be gone but the old regime remains in power. They say the military that removed him after months of protests holds responsibility for the violence they witnessed in Darfur.
After Bashir was overthrown, persistent protests for civilian-rule forced the military to enter negotiations with pro-democracy movements represented by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC). Talks between the TMC and the FCC were mediated by Ethiopia and the African Union and went on for months.
A deal signed on July 17aimed to set up a joint civilian-military ruling body. OnAugust 3, military rulers and protest leaders announced they had reached a final power-sharing deal. They agreed on a constitutional declaration which will pave the way for a promised transition to civilian rule.
The agreement will establish a joint civilian-military ruling body which will oversee the formation of a transitional government.A formal signing ceremony will take place on August 17. In the following days, generals and protest leaders are expected to announce the composition of the new transitional ruling council.
But refugees are expressing their reservations about the agreement.
"They have signed an agreement with this military junta that has killed recently a big number of peaceful protesters. How do we trust the same bloody military generals?" asks Adam.
According to the agreement, the paramilitary RSF will be overseen by the Sudanese army. The transitional council will be headed by a general during the first 21 months and then followed by a civilian for the remaining 18 months. During the negotiations one of the most contentious issues was the military generals'demands for immunityfrom prosecution.
The deal established that immunity could be lifted with permission from the legislative council. But Darfuri refugees in Jordan are not convinced.
"If there is any justice, the first thing would be for the military to be brought to court, but that is not going to happen," adds Adam.
AHuman Rights Watch dispatchsaid that the RSF, led by Hemeti and accused of serious human rights violations, is now "more powerful than ever before, with little reason to fear being held to account for violations and crimes against civilians."
Refugees will only feel safe to return to Sudan when all semblances of the previous regime are removed. But with generals holding on to power, they think significant change is unlikely in the near future.
Despite his distrust that the military will ever be willing relinquish power and the hardship he has endured living as a refugee for the past 16 years, Ahmed holds on to glimmers of hope and forgiveness.
"I could forgive the people who killed my father, burned my village and stole our cattle if there was a chance for reconciliation and real democracy," he says.

Title: Sudan's military junta blames protesters for student killings
Sudan's military junta on Thursday blamed protest leaders for the "massacre" of five young students and claimed the school pupils had been "forced" to protest by their pro-opposition teachers.
Five teenaged school students were shot dead during a rally in al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan province, on Monday.
Outrage against the incident, described as a "massacre" by protest leaders the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), soon spread withdemonstrationsheld across the country.
The United Nations has sincecalledfor an investigation into the shooting, which also led to thecancellationof negotiations between opposition forces and the military.
The military alsoshutteredschools across the country indefinitely following the killings.
Protesters have squarely placed the blame for the killings on theRapid Support Forces(RSF), a feared paramilitary group led by the junta's deputy leader.
The RSF - an officialised offshoot of the Janjaweed militias accused of perpetrating war crimes during the Darfur conflict - is also widely accused of leading the massacre of at least 127 people in the capital Khartoum last month.
But the security and defence committee of the transitional military council on Thursday blamed the SPA for the students' deaths.
Members of the teachers' committee of the SPA in al-Obeid had "forcibly removed" students from class to participate in Monday's rally, the military alleged in a statement carried by Sudan's state news agencySUNA.
"Elements" of the pro-opposition teachers' committee also "beat" teachers at the Al-Obeid Secondary School for Girls in order to force them to bring their students to the rally, the security and defence committee claimed.
The committee holds these "elements" fully responsible for the events, the statement said, and it is now working on identifying the individuals and pursuing legal action against them.
The claims follow a pattern of accusatory statements made by the transitional military council.
The junta has previouslyblamedthe SPA for "inciting" violence by encouraging and organising demonstrations.
The day before a "million-man" march last month, the militarywarnedthe opposition would be held "fully responsible for any victims".

Al Fashaga areaJuly 18, 2021 (WAD KOLI) – The government of Gedaref State in eastern Sudan announced the return of hundreds of families and local residents to cultivate their lands in the Al-Fashaga area for the first time in 25 years.
Ethiopian farmers backed by their militiamen gradually occupied the border fertile area since the beginning of the nineties of the last century, until the size of the occupation reached one million acres.
The Governor of Gedaref, Suleiman Ali, said that his government launched today, “Sunday”, the cultivation of the recovered lands in the Wad Koli locality, which was under total control of Ethiopian militiamen before its recapture by the Sudanese army in November 2020
Ali said that 2,400 families will benefit from his government’s support plan to develop the border strip and areas recovered in Al-Fashqa.
He further stated that the state government will pay for the land ploughing machines and will provide the farmers with 10 machines that will cost 114 million Sudanese pounds.
The Sudanese government launched a series of projects to build roads and infrastructures in the Al-Fashaga area to encourage the return of the farmers chased by the Ethiopian militias as the former regime turned a blind eye.
Also, the army deployed troops on the border area to protect them from the repeated attacks by the Ethiopian militiamen who cross the border from time to time to aggress the Sudanese farmers.

Title: Sudan opposition names five members to join transitional council
Sudan's opposition coalition on Sunday named five people who will be sworn in on Monday as civilian members of the country's new sovereign council, a source within the coalition said.
A landmark power-sharing agreement was finallysignedby the military and the opposition Alliance for Freedom and Change (AFC) coalition on Saturday.
Tens of thousands took to the streets in the capital Khartoum to celebrate the beginning of a new phase in Sudan's political history.
But many are skeptical that the military will be willing to complete the transition to civilian rule and end violence against civilians amid the continued presence of a feared paramilitary leader.
The agreement provides for asovereign council, shared between six civilian members and five military representatives, as the highest power in the land, in addition to a majority-civilian legislative council and a council of ministers that will hold most executive powers.
According to the agreement, each side is allowed to choose five members, with the two sides jointly deciding upon an eleventh civilian member.
The AFC chose Aisha Mousa, Siddig Tower, Mohamed Elfaki Suleiman, Hassan Sheikh Idris and Taha Othman Ishaq for theposts, a source within the coalition toldReuters.
A spokesman for the transitional military council, in power since April, said on Saturday that it had chosen Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, his deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Lieutenant General Yasser Al-Atta for three of the posts.
It has not yet declared who the other two military members of the council will be.
Burhan has since mid-April been the head of Sudan's ruling military council, with Dagalo serving as deputy leader.
Burhan has been seen to take a back seat despite his role, leaving his deputy to represent the public face of the military.
Better known by his nickname Himedti, Dagalo is also the commander of theRapid Support Forces(RSF), a paramilitary force widely held responsible for violence against protesters since the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir.
An officialised offshoot of the Janjaweed militias accused of war crimes in Darfur, Himedti's RSF is accused of leading a brutal June raid on a protest camp in the capital Khartoum, killing more than a hundred people and allegedly raping dozens.
The military will select the head of the council for the first 21 months of the transitional period, which will last for three years and three months before elections are held, according to the agreement.

Title: Sudan arrests paramilitaries for pupils’ killing
KHARTOUM: Sudan’s ruling generals announced on Friday that nine paramilitaries had been arrested for the killing of four teenage demonstrators earlier this week after four people were killed protesting their deaths.The move against the feared paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces came as talks between protest leaders and the ruling generals on a promised transition to civilian rule were due to enter a second day.“An investigation has been launched into the incident of Al-Obeid and seven members of the RSF were immediately dismissed and handed over to civilian judges for trial,” General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the ruling military council, told reporters.“Yesterday (Thursday), two more RSF members were arrested, so a total of nine have been detained.” The fatal shooting of the four schoolchildren and two other demonstrators during a rally against fuel and bread shortages in the city of Al-Obeid on Monday has sparked angry protests in cities across Sudan.On Thursday, four protesters were shot dead in the capital’s twin city of Omdurman, just across the Nile from Khartoum, doctors said. The protest movement has long blamed the irregulars of the powerful RSF, whose commander General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo is deputy head of the ruling military council, for the deadly violence against demonstrators.But after Monday’s shooting, a fellow member of the military council, General Jamal Omar, too blamed the paramilitaries, who sprang out of the Janjaweed militia notorious for alleged war crimes during the conflict in Darfur. Speaking to Egypt’s Al-Ghad television and other media during a tour of Al-Obeid, Omar said RSF fighters guarding a nearby bank had initially used batons to try to stop the protesters gathering.“This action led to a reaction from some students who threw stones at the forces,” Omar said. “This made some members of the force act in their individual capacity to open fire on protesters. We have identified those who fired live ammunition that led to the killing of the six.”The RSF helped the regular army topple longtime president Omar al-Bashir in April following months of mass protests against his rule. But its fighters, who have deployed in cities across Sudan, retain the fearsome reputation they won under the old regime.Protesters have expressed anger at the paramilitaries’ apparent impunity. “Where is the investigation committee?” demonstrators chanted in north Khartoum on Thursday. Talks between protest leaders and the generals were suspended after the Al-Obeid killings, which drew international condemnation, including from their Ethiopian mediator.But the negotiations eventually got under way on Thursday and were due to resume on Friday evening. On the table are the remaining details of the political transition set out in a landmark power-sharing deal signed on July 17.They include the powers of the proposed joint civilian-military ruling body, the deployment of security forces and immunity for the generals over protest-related violence. “Both sides agreed to meet today at 8 pm (1800 GMT) to complete the negotiations,” African Union mediator Mohamed El Hacen Lebatt told reporters. Protest leaders were upbeat. Negotiator Ibrahim al-Amin predicted “good news” from Friday evening’s second session. “We have reached consensus on most of the points,” he said.

Title: ﻿Sudan army, civilians seal landmark deal - Ghanaian Times
Sudan’s ruling military council and civilian opposition alliance have signed a landmark power-sharing deal.
The agreement
ushers in a new governing council, including both civilians and generals, to
pave the way towards elections and civilian rule.
Mohamed
Hamdan “Hemeti” Dagolo, widely regarded as Sudan’s most powerful man,
has pledged to abide by its terms.
Sudan has
seen pro-democracy protests and repression since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir
was ousted in April.
The deal was
signed by Hemeti and Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan for the military
council, and Ahmed al-Rabie for the Alliance for Freedom and Change umbrella
group of pro-democracy protesters.
The prime
ministers of Ethiopia and Egypt and the South Sudanese president were among
regional leaders attended the ceremony.
There were
scenes of wild celebrations on the streets of the capital, Khartoum, after the
ceremony.
Thousands of
cheering people gathered around the convention hall where the documents were
signed, waving Sudanese flags and flashing peace signs.
Khartoum
residents and people from other parts of the country came in on buses and
trains for the occasion.
Under the
deal, a sovereign council, consisting of six civilians and five generals, will
run the country until elections.
The two sides
have agreed to rotate the chairmanship of the council for just over three
years. A prime minister nominated by civilians is due to be appointed next
week.
“We will
stick to every single letter we have agreed on,” Hemeti told the BBC’s
Zeinab Bradawl in an interview broadcast ahead of the ceremony.
“Even
without the agreement, we [would] have to work in this direction because it’s
in the country’s interest,” he added. “Therefore we have to carry out
the agreement, stick to it and support it.”
Hemeti is the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militia that was accused of carrying out a genocide in the Darfur region of western Sudan.
Many people
stood outside the RSF headquarters in central Khartoum, playing revolutionary
songs and chanting at soldiers in celebration, Reuters news agency reports.
The RSF have
been blamed for recent abuses, including the June 3 massacre during which more
than 120 people were reportedly killed, with many of the dead dumped in the
River Nile.
RSF leaders have denied planning the killings, which they say were carried out by rogue elements. –BBC

Title: Sudan arrests 9 RSF paramilitaries over teenage protester killings
Sudan's ruling generals announced on Friday that nine paramilitaries had been arrested for the killing of four teenage demonstrators earlier this week after four people were killed protesting their deaths.
The move against the feared paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces came as talks between protest leaders and the ruling generals on a promised transition to civilian rule were due to enter a second day.
"An investigation has been launched into the incident of Al-Obaid and seven members of the RSF were immediately dismissed and handed over to civilian judges for trial," General Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the ruling military council, told reporters.
"Yesterday (Thursday), two more RSF members were arrested, so a total of nine have been detained."
The fatal shooting of the four schoolchildren and two other demonstrators during a rally against fuel and bread shortages in the city of Al-Obaid on Monday has sparked angry protests in cities across Sudan.
On Thursday, four protesters were shot dead in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, just across the Nile from Khartoum, doctors said.
The protest movement has long blamed the irregulars of the powerful RSF, whose commander General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo is deputy head of the ruling military council, for the deadly violence against demonstrators.
But after Monday's shooting, a fellow member of the military council, General Jamal Omar, too blamed the paramilitaries, who sprang out of the Janjaweed militia notorious for alleged war crimes during the conflict in Darfur.
Speaking to Egypt'sAl-Ghadteleivision and other media during a tour of Al-Obaid, Omar said RSF fighters guarding a nearby bank had initially used batons to try to stop the protesters gathering.
"This action led to a reaction from some students who threw stones at the forces," Omar said.
"This made some members of the force act in their individual capacity to open fire on protesters. We have identified those who fired live ammunition that led to the killing of the six."
The RSF helped the regular army topple longtime president Omar al-Bashir in April following months of mass protests against his rule.
But its fighters, who have deployed in cities across Sudan, retain the fearsome reputation they won under the old regime.
Protesters have expressed anger at the paramilitaries' apparent impunity. "Where is the investigation committee?" demonstrators chanted in north Khartoum on Thursday.Ongoing talks
Talks between protest leaders and the generals were suspended after theAl-Obaid killings, which drew international condemnation, including from their Ethiopian mediator.
But the negotiations eventually got under way on Thursday and were due to resume on Friday evening.

"Both sides agreed to meet today at 8 pm (1800 GMT) to complete the negotiations," African Union mediator Mohamed El Hacen Lebatt told reporters.
Protest leaders were upbeat. Negotiator Ibrahim al-Amin predicted "good news" from Friday evening's second session.
The talks have repeatedly been suspended and remained deadlocked for weeks after a brutal raid on a protest camp in Khartoum on June 3 widely blamed on the RSF.
At least 127 people were killed, according to doctors linked to the protesters. Officials have given a much lower death toll.
It took intense mediation from African Union and Ethiopian diplomats to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table.

RSF leaders have denied planning the killings, which they say were carried out by rogue elements.
Asked about the massacre in the BBC interview, Hemeti said there had been "systematic plotting and conspiracy" to tarnish the reputation of the RSF, whom he described as "protectors" and not killers.
The unrest in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when then President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures.
Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards, and the anger spread to the capital.
The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr Bashir - who had been in charge for 30 years.
In April, the president was overthrown by the military after sit-ins outside the defence ministry, but demonstrators then wanted to ensure authority was swiftly transferred to a civilian administration.
A council of generals led by Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan assumed power, but it has struggled to return the country to normality.
The army is not a unified force in Sudan; paramilitary organisations and various Islamist militias hold some sway.

Vast crowds have taken to the streets in Sudan to demonstrate against military rule, with reports of deaths and injuries and claims of sniper fire.
A Sudanese official has denied that at least 100 people were killed by a paramilitary unit during recent protests, saying that the number was at most 46.
Sudanese soldiers have attacked a pro-democracy protest outside the military headquarters in the capital Khartoum, reportedly leaving 35 people dead.
