Title: DRC rights group: Army kills 13 rebels after Beni attacks | News24
Friday, 20 September
22 Jun 2017
Beni -  Democratic Republic of Congo's army fought off attacks in and around the eastern city of Beni on Thursday, killing at least 13 assailants and capturing 15, a local human rights group said.
Three soldiers also were killed in the fighting and more than seven other people were wounded, including students taking exams, said Omar Kavota, executive director of the Center for Studies of Peace and Defense of Human Rights.
Kavota blamed a new rebel coalition for the bombing of a school and attempted attacks on a women's prison, a police station and the town hall.
Beni Mayor Nyonyi Bwanakawa blamed the attack on Mai Mai rebels. Kavota, however, warned that a new rebel coalition has formed outside Beni after armed men on June 11 attacked the city's central Kangbayi prison, killing at least 11 and freeing 900 prisoners.
The new coalition, which Kavota called the National Revolutionaries Movement, is likely composed of rebels from the Mai Mai, Allied Democratic Forces, former M23 members and others who escaped prison.
Kavota said the new coalition may have external political and military support, given the logistics of the attacks, and he called on the government and military to quickly dismantle the group.
Kavota, whose organisation tracks civilian deaths in the region, also called on the military to increase protection of civilians and public places.
Eastern DRC is home to multiple armed groups that compete for control of the region's vast mineral resources.

Title: UN and World Bank chiefs in DR Congo peace push - 24Tanzania.com
KINSHASA – The UN and World Bank chiefs made a fresh push for peace and development as they arrived Wednesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the latest bout of fighting has sent thousands fleeing.Ban Ki-moonWith major violence flaring up north of the regional hub of Goma for a third day after a six months truce, Kinshasa has accused the rebel movement, known as M23, of trying to scupper peace efforts in the restive eastern DR Congo.Later Wednesday, the rebels announced they were ready for “an immediate cessation of hostilities to facilitate the visit of the United Nations secretary-general in the city of Goma”.The group however warned that if the “truce” is not respected by Congolese forces, rebel fighters have been “clearly instructed to react vigorously with firmness.”MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DR Congo, reported that a rocket launched from a rebel position on Wednesday had killed one person and injured four others.According to the government, the fighting has left 19 dead since Monday.A UN source said there was no question of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon cancelling his trip to Goma because of the unrest, which comes barely a week after the first troops from the new UN intervention brigade arrived in the east.Earlier in the day, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim had pledged $1 billion in aid for Africa’s Great Lakes region while Ban said “now is the time for peace and development for the people of DRC and of the region.”“That is why we are here that is what we will continue to do one hundred per cent,” Ban said in Kinshasa after a meeting with President Joseph Kabila at the start of a three-day tour that will also take him to Uganda and Rwanda.Despite vast mineral wealth, the country — which covers an area roughly the size of western Europe — is ranked by the UN as the world’s least developed and has been devastated by some of Africa’s deadliest wars.Kim said the new funding, intended to promote health, education, trade and infrastructure in the region, “can be a major contributor to a lasting peace.”The rebellion launched in the east last year, which led to the brief capture of Goma in November, threatened to drag the region into a fresh fully-fledged war amid UN claims Rwanda and Uganda backed the M23.Regional and international diplomatic pressure forced peace talks on the warring parties but fresh fighting broke out on Monday, with each side blaming the other for the resumption of violence.While the government said 15 rebels and four army troops died in the clashes, the M23 said the figures were inflated.The UN’s refugee agency said the new spate of fighting less than 10 miles of Goma had led around 30,000 displaced civilians to flee their temporary shelters.“The Mugunga I camp for the displaced, which housed 55,000 people, emptied by 45 percent while Mugunga III, which had 13,000 registered residents emptied by 70 percent,” spokesperson Simplice Kpandji told AFP.Ban said during a visit to Mozambique earlier this week that the deployment of a rapid UN intervention force made up of about 3,000 African troops should be accelerated in view of the fresh unrest.“Considering what has happened I think we must expedite the deployment so they will be fully responsible as soon as possible,” said Ban, who is also accompanied on his trip by UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous and Mary Robinson, the world body’s special envoy for the Great Lakes region.The force was approved by the UN Security Council in March as its first ever “offensive” peacekeeping brigade.Ban is due on Thursday to visit Goma, where troops from the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world have been deployed for years but chronically failed to prevent bloodshed and most recently failed to pin back the M23.M23 — a largely ethnic Tutsi group — vowed to retaliate if attacked by UN troops.They said they had come under attack from government forces early Wednesday.“The FARDC (Congolese army) has been attacking us since 6:00 am (0400 GMT) with mortars, tanks and rocket launchers in the Mutaho area,” M23 military spokesman Vianney Kazarama told AFP.Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the army in North Kivu province, denied government forces had started the fighting.“It is they who began (to attack) as they want to take Mutaho at any price… We are fighting back to defend our positions and so far we have suffered no losses,” Hamuli said.He accused the rebels of deliberately firing mortar shells on civilians to rekindle a crisis and wreck international peace efforts.UN and other aid groups said six people living near the Mugunga camp were wounded by shelling on Tuesday.AFP
Ban Ki-moon
With major violence flaring up north of the regional hub of Goma for a third day after a six months truce, Kinshasa has accused the rebel movement, known as M23, of trying to scupper peace efforts in the restive eastern DR Congo.
Later Wednesday, the rebels announced they were ready for “an immediate cessation of hostilities to facilitate the visit of the United Nations secretary-general in the city of Goma”.
The group however warned that if the “truce” is not respected by Congolese forces, rebel fighters have been “clearly instructed to react vigorously with firmness.”
MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DR Congo, reported that a rocket launched from a rebel position on Wednesday had killed one person and injured four others.
According to the government, the fighting has left 19 dead since Monday.
A UN source said there was no question of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon cancelling his trip to Goma because of the unrest, which comes barely a week after the first troops from the new UN intervention brigade arrived in the east.
Earlier in the day, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim had pledged $1 billion in aid for Africa’s Great Lakes region while Ban said “now is the time for peace and development for the people of DRC and of the region.”
“That is why we are here that is what we will continue to do one hundred per cent,” Ban said in Kinshasa after a meeting with President Joseph Kabila at the start of a three-day tour that will also take him to Uganda and Rwanda.
Despite vast mineral wealth, the country — which covers an area roughly the size of western Europe — is ranked by the UN as the world’s least developed and has been devastated by some of Africa’s deadliest wars.
Kim said the new funding, intended to promote health, education, trade and infrastructure in the region, “can be a major contributor to a lasting peace.”
The rebellion launched in the east last year, which led to the brief capture of Goma in November, threatened to drag the region into a fresh fully-fledged war amid UN claims Rwanda and Uganda backed the M23.
Regional and international diplomatic pressure forced peace talks on the warring parties but fresh fighting broke out on Monday, with each side blaming the other for the resumption of violence.
While the government said 15 rebels and four army troops died in the clashes, the M23 said the figures were inflated.
The UN’s refugee agency said the new spate of fighting less than 10 miles of Goma had led around 30,000 displaced civilians to flee their temporary shelters.
“The Mugunga I camp for the displaced, which housed 55,000 people, emptied by 45 percent while Mugunga III, which had 13,000 registered residents emptied by 70 percent,” spokesperson Simplice Kpandji told AFP.
Ban said during a visit to Mozambique earlier this week that the deployment of a rapid UN intervention force made up of about 3,000 African troops should be accelerated in view of the fresh unrest.
“Considering what has happened I think we must expedite the deployment so they will be fully responsible as soon as possible,” said Ban, who is also accompanied on his trip by UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous and Mary Robinson, the world body’s special envoy for the Great Lakes region.
The force was approved by the UN Security Council in March as its first ever “offensive” peacekeeping brigade.
Ban is due on Thursday to visit Goma, where troops from the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world have been deployed for years but chronically failed to prevent bloodshed and most recently failed to pin back the M23.
M23 — a largely ethnic Tutsi group — vowed to retaliate if attacked by UN troops.
They said they had come under attack from government forces early Wednesday.
“The FARDC (Congolese army) has been attacking us since 6:00 am (0400 GMT) with mortars, tanks and rocket launchers in the Mutaho area,” M23 military spokesman Vianney Kazarama told AFP.
Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the army in North Kivu province, denied government forces had started the fighting.
“It is they who began (to attack) as they want to take Mutaho at any price… We are fighting back to defend our positions and so far we have suffered no losses,” Hamuli said.
He accused the rebels of deliberately firing mortar shells on civilians to rekindle a crisis and wreck international peace efforts.
UN and other aid groups said six people living near the Mugunga camp were wounded by shelling on Tuesday.

Graham Zebedee, British Ambassador to the DRC, delivered the following speech at the Queen's Birthday Party.
Welcome to the QBP 2017 and to this evening.
As you may know, two weeks ago today we had an election in the UK.  As you will also know, two terrorist attacks took place during that election campaign period.
This evening is, then, an appropriate moment for me to say that I was touched by and am very grateful for the many messages of support and condolence here following these attacks, including from His Excellency President Kabila to The Queen.  So please join me in a moment’s silence for all victims of violence, in Manchester and London, in the Kasais and elsewhere in Congo. ………….  Thank you.
But these attacks did not stop the British people from voting.  We have an electorate of 46 million people, and I wish the CENI all the best in enrolling a similar number of people here, to allow the full and timely implementation of the New Year’s Eve agreement.
Following our election we have a government committed to making a success of Brexit and to forging a very close partnership with the rest of Europe from outside the European Union. 
We have a government which intends to keep the UK’s position as the world’s 5th largest economy, and remain one of the largest forces in diplomacy, defence and international development, with friends and allies throughout Africa and all around the world.
This will be my last national day speech as British Ambassador here. During my tenure, I have seen the grandeur and natural beauty of the Congo, experienced  the incredible hard work, passion, unity and solidarity of the Congolese people.  I have seen the amazing talents of Congolese entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, sportsmen and many others, and tonight we celebrate this range of talents.
No one can doubt that the Congo is a country of great potential.  And the United Kingdom is supporting the DRC to fulfil this potential:
Above all, we support dignity for the population, with $500m worth of support each year through our bilateral development programme, regional programmes and contributions to multilateral organisations.  One day, the number of Congolese people in extreme poverty will not be 50 million and rising, but falling towards zero.
One day, the United Kingdom will no longer, for example, need to provide basic healthcare services to 9 million Congolese people, because, one day, the corruption which undermines all attempts at development will be addressed, and one day natural riches of this nation will flow into the government treasury.
One day, the humanitarian aid courageously supplied to millions of  Congolese people, to which we are proud to contribute, will no longer be necessary.
One day, discussions in New York and Geneva will no longer be about massacres, mass graves, and delayed elections.  On day we will speak instead about all UN peacekeepers leaving this country because they are no longer needed, as will happen in Ivory Coast in exactly one week’s time.
And one day, the DRC government and its development partners will focus their exchanges on co-operation, rather than sanctions, resolutions, accusations of interference, and refused visas.
In short, one day Congo’s destiny as a great nation will be realised.Finally, I want to praise our wonderful embassy staff, and their families. No Ambassador could ask for a better team.And I want to mention the efforts of one particular colleague tonight.  He is the first Congolese ever in history to receive the honour Member of the British Empire, which is the equivalent of the Ordres Nationaux Congolais. He works in our embassy office in Goma, and nothing – M23 attacks, volcanic eruptions, nothing – stops him doing his job.
It just remains for me to invite you to raise a toast:
-	Long live Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, whom it is my privilege to represent here.
-	Long live the partnership between the British and Congolese peoples.
-	And long live all who work for a stronger Congo.
Enjoy the rest of the evening and thank you.

Title: DR Congo: Armed men attack prison, killing 8 guards - Trend.Az
Eight guards were killed when a group of armed men attacked the central prison of Kangbayi in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a security officer told Anadolu Agency on Sunday.
Also, over 900 prisoners escaped in the attack staged on the prison located in Beni territory in North Kivu province in eastern DRC, said Lt. Dany Kisung, a security officer in North Kivu.
''A large group of armed men attacked the prison and killed 8 people who were guarding the prison before setting the prisoners free. At least 935 prisoners have escaped,'' said Kisung.
He said the army and police have started hunting for those who attacked the prison as well as escaped prisoners.
Investigations are under way to identify the perpetrators of the attack, said UN radio in DRC quoting Gen. Fall Sikabwe, commander of the 34th Military Region and Sokola1 South Operations.

Most of the prisoners in the central prison of Kangbayi in Beni were prosecuted for participation in the insurgent movements of the ADF rebels and Mayi-Mayi groups, armed robbery and rape, said Gen. Sikabwe.
Julien Plauku, Governor of North Kivu, announced a curfew throughout the city and the territory of Beni as well as the neighboring town of Butembo, the radio added.
In the past few years ADF rebels who originated from Uganda have attacked villages and killed many innocent people until when the army in DRC mounted operations to eliminate them.

Title: Hundreds escape in DRC jailbreak  – DW – 06/12/2017
Gunmen have attacked a prison in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) freeing hundreds of inmates and rebels. It is the third major prison break in the country in the past month.
More than 900 inmates escaped from a prison in the eastern North Kivu province on Sunday after armed assailants stormed the building, the governor of the province said.
Eleven people, including eight security officers, were killed in an exchange of gunfire at the Kangwayi prison in Beni, North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told reporters.
"Of the 966 inmates who were in the prison, there are still 30 detainees left, which means that more than 930 prisoners have escaped," he added.
Beni and the neighboring town of Butembo have been put under curfew. "Only police officers and soldiers should be out from this time," the governor said.
Allied Democratic Forces
Scores of armed groups operate in mineral-rich eastern Congo, with at least 70 in North and South Kivu province alone, according to the US-based Congo Research Group.
Located near the border with Uganda, Beni and surrounding areas have witnessed a spike of violence in the past several years by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
Many of the inmates freed from Kangwayi were captured ADF fighters on trial for violence that has killed more than 700 civilians since 2013.  More than 60,000 people have been displaced due to fighting and looting.
Read: DRC's homemade refugee crisis
According to the UN, the ADF has engaged in numerous violations of human rights law including recruitment of child soldiers, abduction, murder, maiming and rape.
The Muslim rebel group first emerged in western Uganda in the 1990s before becoming active in North Kivu province.  ADF founder and leader, Jamil Mukulu, was arrested in Tanzania in 2015 and subsequently extradited to Uganda to face trial.
Some intelligence sources have suggested the ADF has links toSomalia's al-Shabaab.
Third jailbreak in a month
Sunday's jailbreak is the third to hit the DRC in the past month.
On May 19, dozens of prisoners escaped from a prison in Kasangulu, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the capital Kinshasa.
Two days earlier, armed militia members belonging to the Bundu dia Kongo (BDK) religious-political sectfreed the group's spiritual leader and dozens of prisonersfrom an overcrowded Kinshasa prison.  BDK seeks to restore a pre-colonial kingdom in the western part of the country, as well as parts of Angola and Gabon.
Political crisis fuels more violence
The prison breaks and rising violence come as the Congo faces a mounting political crisis after President Joseph Kabila postponed elections in November, sparking widespread protests.
Kabila should have stepped down in December under a constitutionally mandated two-term limit.
Elections are now scheduled to take place at the end of this year under a power-sharing agreement. But the opposition questions whether Kabila will yield power.
Earlier this month, Kabila hinted that he would not follow through with the deal.
"I have not promised anything at all," Kabila told the German magazine "Der Spiegel" in an interview. "I wish to organize elections as soon as possible. We want perfect elections, not just elections."

Title: Rwanda: Fresh start for ex-FDLR fighters? – DW – 06/16/2017
The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), continue to destabilize eastern Congo and wage war against Rwanda, with hope that one day they will topple the government of President Paul Kagame.
For over 20 years now, the FDLR has killed innocent civilians and pillaged villages in its quest to topple the government in Kigali. Despite regional efforts to disarm and reintegrate them, the rebel outfit continues to destabilize the region and torment civilians. But can former fighters fully integrate in society? DW’s Isaac Mugabi went to find out.
Welcome to Mutobo Demobilization and Reintegration camp, reads a tattered signpost on the road that leads into the camp of former fighters of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). Located in Musanze district, northern Rwanda, the camp has received thousands of former combatants since 2002. The goal is to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into society. The idyllic terrain and chilly weather of this volcanic region makes it ideal for the former combatants to live, in contrast to the vast jungles of the DRC where life was harsh and unforgiving.
On the day I visited the camp, which is a two-hour drive from the capital, Kigali, I was welcomed by the camp manager, Ephraim Kanamugire. He had been informed of my arrival by his superiors in Kigali. After a few pleasantries he gave me unfettered access to the whole camp and allowed me to interact freely with the residents. With my camera strapped around my neck and recorder in hand, I trod off wearily, not knowing what to expect from the battle hardened fighters.
After a few minutes of walking around, but with no clear idea where I was heading to, I met the first group of ex-combatants. They were busy cutting down eucalyptus trees to build a new pig sty. Their tools were axes and machetes, making me think of how these same tools were used to butcher innocent Tutsis during the 1994 genocide.
The intense stares they directed at the intruder made me feel a little bit scared and a thought crossed my mind that I should retreat from my mission, which was to find out how the ex-fighters are coping and whether they are ready to integrate into their communities. But strengthened by earlier assurances from the camp manager I braved on and started taking snapshots of my surroundings.
Mutobo camp hosts dozens of former FDLR fighters, including their families, who have chosen to lay down their arms and voluntarily return home. The majority of the residents are in their early twenties, presumably having left the country as toddlers in the wake of the 1994 genocide. Certainly they were recruited into the rebel ranks by their parents or guardians. The older ones might have played a role in the genocide, But that is something that will be determined once they return to their communities. During their three months at the camp, they are rehabilitated and provided with skills that will allow them to fully integrate and make a living in civilian life.
No conjugal rights
The majority of the women at the camp are wives of the former fighters. But due to the strict rules at the camp, they are obliged to live in separate dormitories. They also receive private counselling sessions. This means that conjugal relations are out of the question and will only happen once the families leave the camp.
At the camp both women and men are taught civic education and receive counseling on a daily basis. This helps them to deal with post-traumatic disorders and adapt to the new environment. Away from the classroom routine, they engage in farming activities like cattle rearing and pig farming. Music is played every evening among a host of other activities that include sports.
From my close and personal interactions with the former fighters I learned about the personal goals they want to achieve once they leave the camp. The common denominator is that they want to go into business and get rich.
This is the case of 19-year-old Damascene Ndagije, whose work is to feed the pigs. He would like to pursue a career as a musician and be a successful artist in the region. "I have a few compositions that I have been working on, that I hope to release once I go back home." he said.
"My music focuses much on peace building, conflict and love." From his looks it is clear to me that Ndagije was born around 1998 in neighboring DRC, and does not know the exact location of his ancestral home in Rwanda. Perhaps, and with the help of his relatives, he will hopefully be able to start a new life as a musician.
Meeting a 'wanted general'
After a short tour of the farm, I sat down withBrigadier General Semugeshi Comes. He is the most senior of the fighters currently at the camp and was a battalion commander with the FDLR. Before surrendering toMONUSCO, the general was a wanted man by the Congolese government for war crimes committed in the Congo.
With a calm demeanor Semugeshi tells me that before he fled Rwanda in 1994 he was a second lieutenant fighting alongside government troops against the advancing rebels led by Paul Kagame (now president). And once Kagame took power, Semugeshi fled to the Congo for fear of retaliation. In later years he fought with different armed groups in the DRC, and once he was enlisted as a Congolese soldier during President Laurent Desire Kabila's rule. This meant that he got a monthly salary and other perks just like any other government soldier. After Kabila was assassinated, and then replaced by his son, President Joseph Kabila, Semugeshi's stay in the Conoglese army was not guaranteed. He once again joined the FDLR. His decision  to return home vountarily came about as recently as in February 2017. Now he feels proud of his decision.
"Before my return, I often communicated to former colleagues who had earlier returned home. They gave me assurances that all was well in Rwanda and that nothing would happen to me," he said. "The advent of smart phones also made it easy for us to exchange information and share pictures that showed the real situation on the ground."
"Many of my fellow commanders have been successfully integrated into society and are doing well. That's why I'm optimistic that I will also be successful," the general added.
It's not easy for many FDLR fighters still in the Congo to voluntarily return home. Many have been brain-washed by the top commanders who are accused of genocide and other crimes against humanity, while others want to go back but are being held against their will. They are often told that they will be killed once they return to Rwanda.
Just daring to express a wish to go home can put a fighter's life in danger. The punishment for harboring such plans is often instant execution, according to those I spoke to. And because of such dire consequences, those who chose to return did it secretly. They trekked long distances under the cover of darkness until they reached a military detachment, which then handed them over to a liaison office of theUN stabilization mission in Congo (MONUSCO).
For many years now, the Rwandan government has been conducting a sensitization campaign using former FDLR fighters as emissaries to send a message of peace to those still holed up in the DRC. The campaign has paid off to a large extent but some challenges, like the lack of reliable telecommunications networks, have hampered these efforts.
According to MONUSCO, in the last fifteen years more than 20,000 FDLR fighters have been repatriated and reintegrated into Rwandan society. Most of the FDLR fighters are Hutu refugees that fled the country in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. It is estimated that the number of remaining FDLR fighters in the DRC is no less than two thousands.
New lease of life
Many former FDLR fighters who have voluntarily returned have received support to start a new life. As most of them left the country when they were toddlers, they have to be taught professional skills like tailoring, to enable them start a new life. It is the case of Eduard Karemera, who left the country at the age of four. Eduard spent most of his youth fighting with different militia groups in the DRC.
Owing to his traumatic experiences, he couldn't remember the location of his ancestral home. While at the camp he was diagnosed with extreme psychosis, a severe mental disorder in which thoughts and emotions are so impaired that contact with reality is lost. His wife Feza at one time contemplated returning to the Congo, because she was afraid that her husband was slowly losing his mind.
"My wife told me of how I tried to escape from the treatment center and sometimes walked naked," he said, "Thank God she didn't leave me." Her resilience paid off and they now live happily together in Eduard's ancestral village.
But perhaps one of the most success stories is that of 50-year-old retired Major Bernard Placide Ndayambaje. He was in charge of communication within the FDLR. When I visited him at his office located in one of Kigali's upscale neighborhoods of Kimihurura, his confidence and pride in his new life struck me directly. He is the senior monitoring and evaluation officer at Kigali Veterans' Cooperative Society (KVCS). He also fled Rwanda in 1994 at the rank of Lieutenant and described life in the DRC as hell on earth.
"We only survived by pillaging villages for food and terrorizing locals there. We also extorted money in order for us to be able to finance our activities," he told DW.
Upon his return to Rwanda five years ago, he was given the option of choosing between doing business and going back to school. He chose the later and since then never looked back. Placide graduated as an engineer at the University of Rwanda and recently completed a Master's program in Humanitarian Work, Reconstruction and Peacekeeping in Switzerland.
"Coming back home and returning to school is the best decision that I ever made in my life," Ndayambaje told DW. He has also played an important role in sensitizing other FDLR fighters to denounce violence and return to their home country.
The coordinator of the reintegration programme, Francis Musoni, says they've been able to successfully integrate former FDLR fighters, largely because of government support and that of other stakeholders like the German government, which contributes financially to the program. "As I speak now, we have been able to provide demobilization support as well as social-economic integration to close to 70,000 former fighters from different armed groups in the DRC including the FDLR," Musoni said.
"We designed a program to mitigate different challenges and did a lot of sensitization in the communities. Former combatants that have been reintegrated have also played a role in persuading their colleagues in the jungles to return home," he told DW.
Apart from helping former fighters successfully integrate into society, Rwanda's demobilzation commission has also built houses for ex-combatants.




Title: Is the Force Intervention Brigade still Justifying its Existence? – CSS Blog Network
This article wasoriginally publishedby theInstitute for Security Studies (ISS)on 22 June 2017.
This potentially effective unit is being hamstrung by politics and concerns about using force in peace operations.
The Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), the sharp end of MONUSCO – the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – earned its stripes in 2013 when it helped the DRC’s army defeat the powerful Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in the east of the country.
But not a lot has been heard about the FIB since, though it has remained deployed in the eastern part of the country for four years. What has it been doing?
The unit of some 3 000 troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi has a more muscular mission than the rest of MONUSCO to use necessary force to ‘neutralise’ all the ‘negative’ armed rebel groups in eastern DRC. Its second target was supposed to be the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the armed group founded in the mid-1990s by Rwandan Hutus who fled the country after the genocide against the Tutsis.

That campaign took a long time to get off the ground, including a long delay when the UN withheld its cooperation from the impending campaign against the FDLR by FARDC – the Armed Forces of the DRC – because two FARDC commanders appointed to head the campaign had been implicated in human rights abuses in the field.
The delays fuelled suspicions that in the eyes of President Joseph Kabila’s government and his fellow SADC members in the FIB, the force’s real mandate was to give DRC rival Rwanda a bloody nose. The FDLR, which provided a pretext for Rwandan President Paul Kagame’s military interventions into eastern DRC several times since the genocide, did not seem to be a high priority for the DRC or the FIB.
Instead the FIB conducted some successful operations against the ethnic-Hunde based Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo (APCLS) and went after another nasty armed group, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
Through 2014 and 2015 MONUSCO and the FIB’s role in that campaign appears to have been confined largely to logistical back-up and intelligence sharing. But after the DRC government and MONUSCO signed a technical agreement on 28 January 2016, the FIB became directly involved in FARDC’s two large-scale operations against the ADF: Usalama I and Usalama II, according to the UN Group of Experts on the DRC in its report of December 2016.
The UN troops contributed ground combat troops and special forces, artillery and ‘air assets’, as the experts group put it, referring to attacks by South Africa’s Rooivalk attack helicopters.
The FIB and the rest of MONUSCO did eventually contribute to FARDC operations against the FDLR, the experts said, but not much. And the FDLR now seems to be imploding of its own accord, splitting in two in 2016 when more than 50 of its officers defected to create a new group called the Conseil national pour le renouveau et la démocratie-Ubwiyunge (CNRD). Several other officers were captured, turned themselves in or deserted.
Countless other armed groups also operate in the region, all of them theoretically on the FIB’s hit list, though what exactly the FIB’s role has been in countering them is not clear.
South African military analyst André Roux says where it has been deployed, the FIB has acquitted itself well. Another military analyst,Helmoed–Römer Heitman, confirms this. Nevertheless Roux questions whether the FIB is ultimately serving its mandated purpose.
The main reason for his doubt is that the ‘framework’ forces – the other elements of MONUSCO – are not always providing the necessary back-up, he says.
He notes that when FARDC and the FIB clear ADF forces, for instance, out of a camp or stronghold, the function of the framework troops should be to hold the captured ground. But this often doesn’t happen and so the rebel forces eventually return to occupy their previous positions. The UN experts confirm this pattern.
One of the main problems, Roux says, is that several of the governments that contribute troops to MONUSCO have given their troops strict instructions not to put themselves at any risk, so they will not defend territory.
He adds that there have been several instances in eastern DRC where civilians have been attacked within a stone’s throw of MONUSCO camps. ‘The local MONUSCO commander then got on his phone to his headquarters back home to request orders. By the time the order went up and back down the chain of command, it was of course too late to help the civilians.’
He prescribes a comprehensive counter-insurgency operation to defeat the negative forces but says Kinshasa politics are frustrating such ambition.
Another military analyst Richard Cornwell notes that there is a widespread misapprehension that the non-FIB ‘framework’ troops in MONUSCO have a less muscular so-called Chapter 6 mandate which allows only peacekeeping but not peace enforcement.
Both he and Roux also note the anomaly that while the FIB has been relatively under-utilised and frustrated in the pursuit of its mandate in eastern DRC, massive violence has been running unchecked in central Kasai, to the West.
FARDC troops have been the ones most accused of several massacres in the running battles that erupted last August when government forces killed tribal chief and militia leader Kamwina Nsapu. DRC authorities recently rebuffed a UN threat to launch an independent probe by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights into the violence after the discovery of dozens of mass graves in the area.
The South African government has been vocally opposed to this inquiry. Kinshasa wants a joint investigation it can control, DRC experts say, and Pretoria is backing up its ally by falling back on the tired old argument of national sovereignty. The UN is expected to vote on the investigation this week.
Whether or not the FIB’s mandate technically extends to Kasai is perhaps moot. But the spectacle of a gigantic UN peacekeeping force with a potent spearhead in the form of the FIB not doing much in the east while thousands are massacred in Kasai, does not look good.
It now seems MONUSCO is sending some 3 000 reinforcements to Kasai, though FIB elements will apparently not be among them.
The enormously expensive MONUSCO mission, which has been in the DRC since 1999, is increasingly attracting international criticism and the European Parliament this year deemed it to be ineffective. Some observers suspect that the UN is contemplating the termination of the FIB mission in particular.
Last month General Derrick Mgwebi, the South African force commander of MONUSCO, briefed the UN Security Council and complained about the council’s recent decision to reduce the size of the mission when the demands on it were rising, including support for what should be imminent elections and protection of civilians in new theatres like Kasai.
He also alluded diplomatically to the problem Roux outlines above – that the chain linking the council’s intentions to the actions of troop- and police-contributing countries and peacekeeping missions broke when it came to the use of force.
It is clear that whatever the positions might be of his political chiefs in New York and in Pretoria, Mgwebi the soldier is feeling the frustration of having a potent weapon in his armoury – the FIB – which he cannot properly use.
