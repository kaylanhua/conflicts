A total of five people were killed in the offensive that eliminated a Rwandan Hutu rebel leader in Democratic Republic of Congo who was wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, the Congolese army said on Thursday.
Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was killed in DRC’s North Kivu province on Tuesday night as was his “secretary general”, the military said.
“The final assessment: five killed, including Mudacumura and his secretary general, four captured and four weapons recovered,” Colonel Sylvain Ekenge, a deputy military spokesman, said.
“The body of the secretary general and the captured are coming to Goma very soon,” he added.
Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60km from the capital of the province Goma.

“With his genocide group, the FDLR, he was destabilising DRC, killing Congolese and Rwandans.”

Title: DRC army says Rwandan Hutu rebel commander Mudacumura killed | ICC News | Al Jazeera
Mudacumura, who led the FDLR fighter group for years, was killed overnight in Rutshuru territory, army says.
DemocraticRepublic of Congo‘s (DRC) army says it has killed Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Rwandan Hutu fighters who was wanted for war crimes by theInternational Criminal Court(ICC).
Mudacumura had been a leader of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) since its founding in 2000 by Hutu officials, who fled Rwanda at the end of the 1994 genocide.
The FDLR has waged periodic war with the DRC government and rival armed groups, and Rwanda’s government has cited its presence in DRC to justify repeated interventions across the border.
“Sylvestre Mudacumura was neutralised by the armed forces of Congo along with all the elements accompanying him … in Rutshuru territory,” army spokesman Richard Kasonga told Reuters news agency.
Mudacumura’s death is the latest blow to the FDLR, which has been weakened in recent years by arrests of several of its leaders and military pressure from the DRC’s army and other armed groups.
The international court issued an arrest warrant for Mudacumura in 2012 for alleged attacks against civilians, murder, rape and torture in eastern DRC, where armed groups have operated since the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Prosecutors accused Mudacumura, believed to be about 65 years old, of orchestrating attacks on civilians during a 2009-10 conflict against the DRC and Rwandan armies.
United States-based rights group Human Rights Watch said FDLR fighters killed more than 700 civilians during that conflict in an effort to intimidate communities not to cooperate with the army.
In Rwanda, Mudacumura served as deputy commander of the presidential guard, where he was in charge of President Juvenal Habyarimana’s security. During the genocide, he led a battalion in northern Rwanda.
Army spokesman Kasonga said he hoped Mudacumura’s death would encourage holdout members of the FDLR, still fighting in the bush or temporarily settled in government-run camps in the DRC, to accept repatriation to Rwanda.
Thousands of former FDLR members and their families have returned to Rwanda, but many have refused. International efforts to find a third country to resettle them have so far been unsuccessful.
The FDLR has also been a source of friction between Rwanda and Uganda.
In March, Rwanda accused Uganda of supporting the FDLR and another DRC-based rebel group opposed to the Rwandan government. Uganda denied the allegations.
The ICC was set up as a court of last resort intended to prosecute senior leaders allegedly responsible for grave crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity when national courts prove unable or unwilling to take on such cases.
But the ICC has suffered several setbacks over recent years with some of its most high-profile suspects walking free, while it has also beencriticisedfor mainly trying African suspects so far.

Rwandan Hutu rebel leader Sylvestre Mudacumura.
A Rwandan Hutu rebel leader wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crime charges has been shot dead by the Congolese army, a DRC military spokesperson said on Wednesday in what Kigali called “good news for peace”.
Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was “definitively neutralised” in DRC’s North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.
Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.
Neighbouring Rwanda welcomed the news, saying it proved DRC President Felix Tshisekedi’s commitment to fighting “negative forces”.
“The death of Sylvestre Mudacumura is good news for peace and security in the region,” Rwandan state minister for regional affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe told AFP.
“With his genocide group, the FDLR, he was destabilising DRC, killing Congolese and Rwandans.”
The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
According to the United Nations, the force numbers between 500 and 600 active fighters.
They are scattered across the mineral-rich eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in southern Katanga, and the group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls.
“His death confirms the commitment of President Felix Tshisekedi in fighting negative forces and will open a new era of good and peaceful cooperation between DRC and countries in the region,” Nduhungirehe said.
The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.
Eastern DRC has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.
Mudacumura’s death “is a strong signal for other rebels,” said General Richard Kasonga, spokesman of the Congolese army, calling it a “big step” in the fight against insecurity and terrorism.
He called on “all armed groups to lay down their arms, or face the same fate as Mudacumura.”
During a visit to the region early this month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called on the rebels to disarm.
US researcher Jason Stearn said the death was “an extremely important event”, telling AFP that the FDLR is “one of the biggest armed groups in the region, even if they have diminished in capacity.”
However, Stearn, of New York University’s Congo Research Group, held out little hope for peace in a region where around 130 armed groups remain active.
“We have seen a lot of commanders die without the groups necessarily disappearing or diminishing in force,” he said.

Title: UN chief urges funding for Sahel states - Digital Journal
Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday suggested the UN help fund the fight against jihadism in the Sahel, warning "we are not winning the war against terrorism" in the frail region.
"I am in favour of funding by the United Nations, with obligatory contributions for the G5 Sahel force," Guterres said in an interview with Radio France Internationale (RFI).
"I totally believe we are not winning the war against terrorism in the Sahel and that the operation should be strengthened."
Islamist rebels have launched an insurgency on the Sahara's southern rim, rocking the impoverished states of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Niger.
Those countries, along with Mauritania, have teamed up in a French-backed initiative, the G5 Sahel, to mount a 5,000-man anti-terror force.
But the scheme is struggling in the face of poor equipment, training and chronic lack of funds.
Guterres said he expected countries to make "concrete proposals" to the international community during a forthcoming West African meeting in Ouagadougou.
Guterres, who made the comments on Monday on a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the "threat of terrorism has to be seen on a continental scale."
He described the DRC as a linchpin for stability, and noted the country's long struggle with an Islamist-rooted militia, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), in its east.
The ADF, originally from western Uganda, is connected to other African jihadists, Guterres maintained.
"In my opinion the ADF today is part of a network that starts in Libya and stretches to the Sahel, to the Lake Chad region, and which is present in Mozambique," he said.
He said he did not know whether there was a "formal link" between the ADF and the so-called Islamic State -- which has claimed several attacks in eastern DRC -- but pointed to what he called "real links" between the ADF and Mozambique militants.
The UN has some 16,000 troops in the DRC in its MONUSCO peacekeeping mission, one of the world's largest. Its mandate is due to expire on December 31.
"Abandoning the DRC would be suicidal, not just for the Congolese but also for the international community," Guterres warned.

OTHER WIDGETS
Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed on Wednesday that the army had killed Sylvestre Mudacumura, the commander of a Rwandan Hutu militia who is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court.
Mudacumura, who has led the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) for years, was killed overnight in eastern Congo’s Rutshuru territory, army spokesman Richard Kasonga said.
News of his death was welcomed by authorities in Rwanda.
“The death of Sylvestre Mudacumura is good news for peace and security in the region,” state minister for regional affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe told AFP.
“With his genocide group, the FDLR, he was destabilising DRC, killing Congolese and Rwandans.”
“His death confirms the commitment of President Felix Tshisekedi in fighting negative forces and will open a new era of good and peaceful cooperation between DRC and countries in the region,” said Nduhungirehe.
The international court issued an arrest warrant for Mudacumura in 2012 for alleged attacks against civilians, murder, rape and torture in eastern Congo, where militia members have operated since the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.
Mudacumura was the deputy commander of the Rwandan presidential guard during the genocide, before fleeing to Congo with other senior security officials.
There, they formed the militia that would later come to be known as the FDLR and waged periodic war with the Congolese government and other armed groups.
The Rwandan government cited the FDLR’s presence on Congolese soil to justify repeated interventions across the border.

Title: Que va changer la mort du chef des FDLR en RDC ? – DW – 19/09/2019
Les autorités militaires ont confirmé la mort du chef des rebelles FDLR Sylvestre Mudacumura et de plusieurs de ses proches lieutenants.
To play this audio please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 audio
Sylvestre Mudacumura aurait été tué lors d'une opération militaire conjointe conduite par les armées congolaises et rwandaises dans le Nord-Kivu, plus précisément dans le territoire de Rutshuru, selon le communiqué de l’armée congolaise.
Selon le général Kosonga qui dirige en ce moment les opérations sur le terrain,"les opérations ont été menées de manière professionnelle et l’objectif a été atteint. L’effet final était la neutralisation définitive de Mudacumura et de ses lieutenants. Nous menons les opérations de manière souveraine chez nous parce que l’objectif est 'groupe armé zéro' sur l’ensemble de la partie orientale de notre pays".
"Il semait la terreur"
Sylvestre Mudacumura est un vétéran des Forces de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) qui opère dans le territoire de Rutshuru et de Lubero. Il avait conquis de larges étendues de territoire au Nord-Kivu dont une partie du Parc national de Virunga. La population, terrorisée par les attaques meurtrières des groupes rebelles, redoutait que les FDLR et les ADF, une autre formation qui regroupe des combattants ougandais, se coalisent pour combattre les forces armées de RDC.
Sa neutralisation et celle de quelques-uns de ses proches lieutenants réjouissent les habitants de la région comme Noella Muliwavyo, présidente de la société civile au Nord-Kivu. Pour elle,"c’est une bonne nouvelle parce que pour nous, en tant que population du Nord-Kivu, nous sommes menacés par à la fois par les FDLR et les ADF.Dans ses actions, il(Sylvestre Mudacumura)s’accaparait les biens de la population et semait la terreur. Là où il s’installait, il y avait vraiment un manque d’autorité de l’Etat."
Selon la journaliste allemande Simone Schlindwein, Sylvestre Mudacumura portait sur lui au moment de sa mort une clé USB avec les archives cryptées des FDLR.  Son élimination est également un succès politique pour le nouveau président congolais Félix Tshisekedi qui a promis de pacifier l’est de la RDC.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Africa (25 September 2019) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 6 more
Developments of the past week in Africa include operations against Al Shabaab in Somalia, inter-communal violence targeting civilians in Cameroon, and continued instability in the  Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where Islamic State claimed an attack targeting security forces. Demonstrations in Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Sudan are the other significant events of the past week.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a significant attack took place in Kitchanga town of North Kivu state during the past week. Although reports state that the army of DRC repelled an attack by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) on 14 September, Islamic State also claimed responsibility of the attack on the following day for its ‘Central Africa’ branch. Another significant development is a series of attacks in Ituri province, conducted by suspected CODECO (Cooperative for Development of Congo) militia. Dozens of civilian casualties were reported while MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo) is reported to have repulsed some of the attacks. CODECO is mostly comprised of Lendu ethnic community, and have long been active in Djugu territory of Ituri state (ACLED Regional Overview, Africa, 9 July 2019). Violence in the region has caused displacement of over 10,000 people.
Meanwhile, a Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) leader-Sylvestre Mudacumura- was killed by the Congolese army on 17 September. Mudacumura was wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In Somalia, Al Shabaab militants sustained their activities targeting the government workers. An attack in Mogadishu using remote explosives killed at least three civilians. Civilians were further subjected to violence in the country during the past week, as a local source claimed that African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) killed civilians in Qoryooley town of the Lower Shabelle, allegedly as a retaliation to an Al Shabaab attack targeting the Ugandan troops (of AMISOM) in the same town.
While the battles continued in Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle and Banadir regions, military forces also claimed to have killed 13 Al Shabaab militants in Lower Juba region. Additionally, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) targeted Al Shabaab militants in Kismayo town, reportedly killing two militants.
Meanwhile, Boko Haram violence continued in Nigeria and Cameroon. In Extreme-Nord region of Cameroon, Boko Haram looted civilian shops while killing nine members of a family in Borno State of Nigeria. Military operations against Boko Haram in Extreme-Nord killed over a dozen Boko Haram members.
In Egypt, a number of protests were held towards the end of the past week, despite a law requiring government approval for public demonstrations since 2013, when the current president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power. Having gathered in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and many other cities, the demonstrators accused the president of misspending public funds and corruption. Ongoing through this week, many protests drew the attention of the police forces.
In Zimbabwe, protests took place after the leader of the Zimbabwe Hospitals Doctors Association (ZDHA) went missing during a pay strike. The missing doctor was found some days after his disappearance and claimed to have been subjected to torture; bringing the abductions targeting the political opposition in Zimbabwe to the surface.
Demonstrations in Sudan demanded the removal of the former regime appointees from their current duties. On 19 September, over a thousand protesters marched to the headquarters of the Ministry of Justice in Khartoum, demanding the elimination of all symbols of the former regime in the country. Moreover, in South Darfur, after Rapid Support Forces killed an internally displaced student, riots in the Mershing camp resulted in the killing of four demonstrators by the police forces. In Idan village of the same region, the Darfur communal militia attacking the farmers in Idan village caused protesters in Gereida town demand improvements in security.

Title: Rwanda yasema kifo cha Mudacumura wa FDLR ni bishara njema 
Print
Naibu waziri wa mambo ya nje wa Rwanda Balozi Olivier Nduhungirehe amesema kuwa kifo cha kamanda wa kikundi cha waasi wa FDLR Sylvestre Mudacumura ni bishara njema ya kupatikana amani na usalama nchini DRC na katika eneo.
"Ni habari njema kwamba kutakuwa na amani na usalama nchini DRC na katika eneo lote. Na huu ni uthibitisho kuwa uongozi mpya wa Congo unatekeleza ahadi yake ya kuondoa vikundi vyote venye kuleta machafuko katika eneo la mashariki ya DRC."
Taarifa za Jeshi la Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Congo zimesema kamanda huyo wa kundi la waasi kutoka Rwanda Sylvestre Mudacumura, aliyekuwa anatafutwa na mahakama ya kimataifa, ICC, aliuawa usiku wa kuamkia Jumatano na Jeshi la DRC.
Wakati huohuo kifo cha kamanda wa waasi wa FDLR, Sylvestre Mudacumura kimepokelewa kwa hisiya mseto na upande wa watetezi wa haki za binadamu katika jimbo la kivu kaskazini.
Omar Kavota, mwanaharakati wa haki za binadamu katika wilaya ya Rutshuru ambayo ni ngome ya waasi hao kutoka Rwanda, anasema usalama utapatikana baada ya muasi huyo kuuawa.
“Ingawa kifo cha mwanadamu hakiwezi kufurahiwa, tunafikiri kifo cha muhalifu huyo wa kivita kitasaidia kuleta usalama katika maeneo ya kivu kaskazini.”
Lakini Placide Nzilamba, ambaye anaongoza shirika la haki za binadamu CIDHOP, anasema ilikuwa bora muasi huyo afikishwe mahakamani kujibu mashtaka dhidi yake.
“Kama shirika la kutetea haki za binadamu, sisi tulikuwa tunasubiri akifishwe mahakamani. Hivi sasa kamanda huyo wa FDLR ameuawa, kuna taarifa nyingi ambazo hazitajulikana. Tunaona ilikuwa vyema jeshi la Congo limkamate na limfikishe mbele ya mahakama.”
Mahakama ya ICC, ilitoa ilani ya kutaka Mudacumura akamatwe, mnamo mwaka 2012, kwa kudaiwa kuongoza mashambulizi dhidi ya raia, mauaji, unajisi na mateso, mashariki mwa DRC.
Kundi hilo limekuwa likitekeleza shughuli zake mashariki mwa DRC tangu mwaka 1994, tangu kutoka mauaji ya halaiki ya watu katika nchi jirani ya Rwanda.Mudacumura alikuwa naibu wa kamanda wa kikosi cha ulinzi wa Rwanda wakati wa mauaji ya halaiki 1994, kabla ya kutorokea DRC, na waliokuwa maafisa wa ngazi ya juu katika usalama wa Rwanda.
Kundi la FDLR, limekuwa likifanya mashambulizi ya kila mara dhidi ya serikali na raia wa DRC.

Title: DR Congo troops shoot dead Rwandan warlord
Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was "definitively neutralised" in DRC's North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.Neighbouring Rwanda welcomed the news, saying it proved DRC President Felix Tshisekedi's commitment to fighting "negative forces"."The death of Sylvestre Mudacumura is good news for peace and security in the region," Rwandan state minister for regional affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe told AFP."With his genocide group, the FDLR, he was destabilising DRC, killing Congolese and Rwandans."The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.According to the United Nations, the force numbers between 500 and 600 active fighters.They are scattered across the mineral-rich eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in southern Katanga, and the group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls."His death confirms the commitment of President Felix Tshisekedi in fighting negative forces and will open a new era of good and peaceful cooperation between DRC and countries in the region," Nduhungirehe said.The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.- Warning to other warlords -Eastern DRC has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.Mudacumura's death "is a strong signal for other rebels," said General Richard Kasonga, spokesman of the Congolese army, calling it a "big step" in the fight against insecurity and terrorism.He called on "all armed groups to lay down their arms, or face the same fate as Mudacumura."During a visit to the region early this month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called on the rebels to disarm.US researcher Jason Stearn said the death was "an extremely important event", telling AFP that the FDLR is "one of the biggest armed groups in the region, even if they have diminished in capacity."However, Stearn, of New York University's Congo Research Group, held out little hope for peace in a region where around 130 armed groups remain active."We have seen a lot of commanders die without the groups necessarily disappearing or diminishing in force," he said.

Title: DR Congo troops shoot dead Rwandan warlord - JusticeInfo.net
A Rwandan Hutu rebel leader wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crime charges has been shot dead by the Congolese army, a DRC military spokesperson said on Wednesday in what Kigali called "good news for peace".
Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was "definitively neutralised" in DRC's North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.
Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.
Neighbouring Rwanda welcomed the news, saying it proved DRC President Felix Tshisekedi's commitment to fighting "negative forces".
"The death of Sylvestre Mudacumura is good news for peace and security in the region," Rwandan state minister for regional affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe told AFP.
"With his genocide group, the FDLR, he was destabilising DRC, killing Congolese and Rwandans."
The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
According to the United Nations, the force numbers between 500 and 600 active fighters.
They are scattered across the mineral-rich eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in southern Katanga, and the group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls.
"His death confirms the commitment of President Felix Tshisekedi in fighting negative forces and will open a new era of good and peaceful cooperation between DRC and countries in the region," Nduhungirehe said.
The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.
- Warning to other warlords -
Eastern DRC has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.
Mudacumura's death "is a strong signal for other rebels," said General Richard Kasonga, spokesman of the Congolese army, calling it a "big step" in the fight against insecurity and terrorism.
He called on "all armed groups to lay down their arms, or face the same fate as Mudacumura."
During a visit to the region early this month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also called on the rebels to disarm.
US researcher Jason Stearn said the death was "an extremely important event", telling AFP that the FDLR is "one of the biggest armed groups in the region, even if they have diminished in capacity."
However, Stearn, of New York University's Congo Research Group, held out little hope for peace in a region where around 130 armed groups remain active.

A Rwandan Hutu rebel leader wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crime charges has been shot dead by the Congolese army, a DRC military spokesperson said on Wednesday.
Sylvestre Mudacumura, commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was "definitively neutralised" in DRC's North Kivu province on Tuesday night, General Leon-Richard Kasonga said.
Mudacumura, wanted for charges including rape, torture and pillage, was killed about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the capital of the province Goma.
The FDLR was created by Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern DRC after the genocide of Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994.
Its fighters are scattered across the eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu as well as in northern Katanga.
The FDLR, opposed to the current Rwandan government, has not launched any large-scale offensive in Rwanda since 2001.
The group is regularly accused of committing atrocities against civilians in the zones it controls.
Eastern DR Congo has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.

Title: UN chief Guterres warns of 'continental scale' terrorism in Africa
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres this week highlighted the threat of cross-border terrorism in Africa, warning that the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Allied Democratic Forces insurgent group is now linked to Islamist militias across the continent.
Guterres, who made the comments on Monday, September 3 during a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the “threat of terrorism has to be seen on a continental scale.”
He described the DRC as a linchpin for stability, and noted the country’s long struggle with an Islamist-rooted militia, theAllied Democratic Forces, in its east.
The ADF was founded in 1995 at Bunia in the DRC, by members of the Uganda Muslim Freedom Fighters who had been driven out of Uganda. The group is now connected to other African jihadist groups, Guterres maintained.
“In my opinion the ADF today is part of a network that starts in Libya and stretches to the Sahel, to the Lake Chad region, and which is present in Mozambique,” hesaidin an interview with Radio France Internationale.
He said he did not know whether there was a“formal link” between the ADF and Islamic State– which hasclaimed several attacks in eastern DRC– but pointed to what he called “real links” between the ADF and Mozambique militants.
In April,ISIS formally recognized its Central Africa Province in Democratic Republic of Congo, when its centrally controlled media outlets began to attribute attacks to ISCAP, and during his first video appearance in five years,ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was seen viewing a document entitled “Wilayat Central Africa.”
There was earlier evidence thatISIS had ties to the Allied Democratic Forces, which mainly operates in the border area of North Kivu province, but it is unclear if the new ISIS affiliate is the ADF, a splinter group, or a different organization.
The U.N. has some 16,000 troops in the DRC in its MONUSCO peacekeeping mission, one of the world’s largest. Its mandate is due to expire on December 31.
“Abandoning the DRC would be suicidal, not just for the Congolese but also for the international community,” Guterres warned.
He said the he wanted a strategic review of MONUSCO to make it more effective. “It’s not a question of the number of soldiers, it’s a matter of strategy,” he said, adding that he also wanted to increase cooperation mechanisms with the DRC armed forces.
