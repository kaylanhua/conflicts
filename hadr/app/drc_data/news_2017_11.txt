Title: Tanzanian army on peace mission, not to fight M23 in DRC - 24Tanzania.com
Tanzanian soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are there to keep peace and security and not to fight with the M23 rebels.
Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) spokesperson, Major Erick Komba
Addressing journalists in Dar es Salaam, the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) spokesperson, Major Erick Komba said that Tanzania did not send soldiers in the DRC for fighting against M23 and has no problem with Rwanda in the ongoing operation.
He said the soldiers were among other things expected to prevent the expansion of rebel territory, neutralisation of rebel activities and disarming all armed groups in the country.
“Tanzania has sent her troops in the DRC for a peace keeping mission and not to fight against the M23 and it is paramount to note that our soldiers are in Rwanda under MONUSCO, therefore we are there with the blessings of the United Nations and Rwanda as one of the Great Lakes countries did not have any objection to the presence of our soldiers,” Major Komba said.
He said that the Tanzania soldiers in the DRC are part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) standby brigade, saying that Rwanda has assisted Tanzania in moving the troops through the borders.
Mr Komba warned media houses especially newspapers on issuing false reports which claim that Tanzanian forces have been engaging the M23 rebels in numerous fights, instead of helping to restore peace and security in DRC.
On his part, the Director of the Tanzania Information Services, Mr Assah Mwambene said that the presence of Tanzanian troops in the DR Congo is aimed at helping to keep peace and security, saying that there are no conflicts between Tanzania and Rwanda in this operation.
“In fact, some newspapers have played a major role in instigating wrong information to the people of Tanzania with false reports on the operations of the Tanzanian soldiers in the DRC, something which might bring about negative impacts,” Mr Mwambene said.
On numerous occasions, the M23 along with other armed groups have clashed with the DRC forces (FARDC) in the eastern DRC.
As part of an effort to address the underlying causes of violence in the region, the government of DRC along with 10 other countries and four regional and international institutions adopted a framework to consolidate peace in the country.

Since 2014, the gambling revenue has improved to some reasonable extent, despite the weakening economies and the challenges. The gross gambling revenue in South Africa has posted their second-largest annual increase in the last five years as casino takes the most significant share as casino rises to 4.5% in the year before. Generally, as of 2014, the revenue generated by the gambling revenue in South Africa is R2.1 billion. The gross gambling revenue across those sectors is expected to rise R23.9 billion straight to R30.3 billion. The annual increase is 4.8%
We got some highlights from the fourth annual edition of the PWC, and the title is “Taking the odds: Gambling outlook for 2015 – 2019. The publication is on a detailed analysis of the gambling industry. Each of the segments as the key trend which is observed, the challenges, and the prospect. The national gambling board in South Africa can be said to be the source of this data. Looking at the way it pertains to Nigeria, figures are extrapolated and derived from companies based on selection. While talking about the Kenya figures, they are extrapolated and derived by the casino taxes
Out of the three countries that the research was carried out on, the country that happens to have the largest gambling market in South Africa. The gambling revenue is approximated to be R17.2 as of 2014, while in Nigeria and Kenya, they are R479 million and R2118 million respectively
The gambling industry in South Africa made it clear that the gambling industry in South Africa will remain exciting and vibrant just like it has always been, but then it is essential to state the fact that the sector is facing some challenges as there are changes in the regulation of the economic climate
One of the issues that are having a debilitating effect on the sector is illegal gambling online. Aside from this, some casino is as well facing some competition from other facilities that can be found in their areas
In South Africa, part of the most significant gambling component is the casino market, as the total revenue amounts to 72% of the gambling revenue in 2014. This is a reflection of the maturation of the segment. As things stand, 38 out of the 40 are now running smoothly. The department of trade gave an intention to increase the number of licenses on the #1stOctober 2015
Other forms of gambling are posing high competition, and they include limited payout machines, electronic bingo terminal, and some other sport betting
Gambling taxes and levies
As of 2014, the total amount of levies and taxes is R2.5 billion. The amount that was estimated on the VAT Output is R1.9 billion, and you can probably consider it to be 11% of the gambling revenue
Casino Gambling
The leading province was Gauteng, and the revenue is generated as of 2014 is R7.2 billion. The western cape and the KwaZulu-Natal, each of them has like 5 casinos that carry out a better operation. These provinces are so significant, and the amount they hold in the gambling revenue is 76.1%
As of 2015, the projection that was made was for the gambling revenue to drop to 0.4%, and this is making the absolute reflection of the slow economy. After then we try to figure out the better improvement, the economic condition was able to maintain its stability, and this gives some individual operators such as Tsogo Sun and the Sun International to make an expansion of some properties. At this same moment, the casino industry will as well be faced with significant competition as the Bingo Outlet and the LPM expand.
Limited Payout
The limited payout machine is primarily located in the clubs, restaurants, and bars, and they accounted for 9% out of the gross revenue in 2014. The projection was made that in 2019, it will expand by 10.3%. Of course, the introduction of new sites and machines is responsible for the expansion of the market. Having said this, the competition that arises from the terminal of the electronic Bingo will lead to the slower growth for the LPM
Bingo
This happens to be the smallest category as it accounts for 5% in the gross revenue. In 2014, the availability of Bingo was made in KwaZulu-Natal, and it derived much benefit from the North West and Eastern Cape for a full year. Guateng dominates the market continuously as it generated R903 million, the Eastern Cape followed it by R114 million. The introduction of the electronics terminal are yet to be introduced into Free State, Limpopo, Northern Cape and the Western Cape. Expectation is placed on Bingo to turn out to be the category that grows at a very fast pace. Projection was made for 19% compound annual increase, then in 2014 it is R1.1 billion and it will later rise to R2.7 billion in 2019
Sports Betting
The dominant market in sports betting market as 2014 is the horse racing, it is at R1.9 billion. As at 2015 there were speculations that the lack of wagering that is related to the world cup can have a debilitating effect on the sports betting market
National Lottery
Through the forecast period, the National Lottery is expected to remain the category that experiences the slowest growth. The National Lottery projects that the Gross Gambling Revenue will rise from R2.28 billion then in 2014, and in 2019, it will have risen to R2.33 billion
Casino Gambling in Nigeria
In 2014, the gambling revenue rose by 17.1%, as they continue the annual increase of double-digit. The Ebola virus that hit the country in 2014 does not affect the casino. The only thing that affected it was the slowing growth rate of the economy, and this is as well responsible for the slow growth in the industry. The forecast that was made then was that there would be 8.5% compound annual rate in USD68.9 million in 2019
Of course, Nigeria is expected to witness an expansion compare to South Africa and Kenya
Casino Gambling in Kenya
The casino gambling revenue in Kenya rose by 6.9% in Kenya as of 2014; in 2013, there is an 11.2% increase. Between 2009 and 2011, the annual growth is 24.2%. The conclusion was that the 20% withholding tax that was imposed id responsible for the slow down that occurs. Additionally, the competition that arises from the national lottery can as well contribute to this
Just like Nigeria, Kenya has been disturbed by terrorism, and this has hampered tourism. Having said this, the casinos in the industry do not have to rely on tourism before they run successfully. The forecast that was made is that there is an increase of 7.5% in the compound annual rate and it rises from 20.1 million USD as of 2014, to 28.9 million USD in 2019
Conclusion
Calicchio concluded that the overall gambling industry in Nigeria and South Africa is changing from time to time. Having said this, the industry will be affected adversely as it experiences a slower economic growth. But then if you can improve the economic condition, spending will be fueled at a very fast rate. While in Kenya, the growth remains stable during the next five years in comparison 2014 increment
To sum it up in the three market regions, the revenue is totaled to be R19.9 billion, which is estimated to be 1..8 billion USD as of 2019. The annual increase is 2%

Title: 'Mum, they're killing me': Child kidnappings surge in DRC's Goma | News24
Friday, 20 September
21 Nov 2017
Goma - Valerie pulls a pair of blue shorts and a small white shirt out of a plastic bag. The shirt is stained with blood. It's the school uniform of her eight-year-old son Nathanael, who was kidnapped on his way to class in Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The capital of the troubled North Kivu province in the east of the vast African country has seen a surge in children being kidnapped, tortured, and sometimes even killed.
Nathanael's kidnappers demanded a four-figure ransom, in dollars - a sum that his single mother in her 30s, who has no fixed income, could not possibly afford to pay, although they do live in a large house provided by one of Valerie's parents.
"It was definitely a Monday," says Valerie of the day when her nightmare began. She cannot be certain if it was in July or August of this year, although everything else is seared into her memory.
On the Tuesday the kidnapper said over the phone: "Give us $5 000 or you will find your son's body on your doorstep."
On the Wednesday, Valerie scraped together 20 dollars and sent it by Airtel Money, a mobile phone money transfer system widely used in Africa. After the meagre sum was dispatched, her son screamed over the phone: "Mum, they're killing me!"
On the Sunday, Nathanael was released with an earlobe sliced in half and stab wounds on his arms, his mother said. He told her another child was killed in front of him during his detention.
'Due to poverty'
Goma, a city of about a million people, sits in a tourist-friendly location between a lake and a mountain.
But it has endured a brutal recent history - the fallout from the Rwandan genocide, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002 and the mutiny of the rebel group M23 a decade later.
The area is also riven by fighting between armed rebel groups.
Jean-Paul Lumbulumbu, a well-known lawyer in Goma, said he represented a total of 20 families who have fallen prey to kidnappers, including one or two cases in which children were killed.
The kidnappings started in Goma earlier this year, the lawyer said, citing two videos on his phone as evidence.
In the first video, the lawyer conducted a sit-in on August 11 calling on the authorities and police to act against delinquency in general.
In the second, he expressed satisfaction at a report that three kidnappers were sentenced to 20 years in jail. One of the kidnapped children was killed, judges said during the trial, according to the report by UN station Okapi.
"It has been about a year since this phenomenon began in this city," a police source told AFP.
"In my humble opinion, I would say that it is the economic situation that drives people to such criminal practices. It is due to poverty," the source added.
Nightmares
Previously in North Kivu, abductions were normally adults being taken by one of the armed groups active in the region.
But now "the modus operandi is always the same. They torture the child so that the parents give them something," the police source said.
The police are attempting to track the kidnappers by asking telephone companies for the identity of suspects, who receive ransom money by using lots of SIM cards to cover their tracks.
As night falls on Valerie's large living room, the light is not turned on, probably to save money. In a corner, Nathanael's sister and two brothers play in the light of a mobile phone, listening as their mother recounts her story in Swahili.
As for Nathanael, "he went back to school, but the teacher suggested that he rest," his mother says.
"At night he has nightmares, shouting 'Achab!'" - the name of the child who was murdered in front of him.

Title: DRC says election pressure due to foreign 'greed' for cobalt | News24
Friday, 20 September
09 Nov 2017
Kinshasa - The Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday said foreign "greed" for its cobalt lay behind the "malicious" pressures weighing on the country's electoral process.
The DRC is in the grip of a crisis over plans to hold presidential elections, which were delayed by President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down on the expiry of his second and final term last December.
Under a compromise deal, the vote was scheduled to take place this year.
But on October 12, the country's electoral commission said logistical problems in violence-troubled regions made it impossible to hold the elections before early 2019.
After the United States demanded the vote be held next year, the commission last week said the election will take place on December 23, 2018.
In a press conference on Wednesday, government spokesperson Lambert Mende condemned what he called "an avalanche of external pressures on (DRC's) electoral process."
The pressures, he charged, were dictated by "greed" abroad for DRC's "immense strategic natural resources".
"After rubber, copper and coltan respectively, it is now our reserves in cobalt which are the cause of these malicious intrusions," Mende said, without elaborating.
UN peacekeeper dies
A mineral-rich country a quarter the size of Europe, but mired in poverty and corruption as well as scarred by ethnic divisions and fighting in its east, DRC is one of Africa's most volatile nations.
Western countries, as well as the influential Roman Catholic church, have led the effort to prevent the crisis over Kabila's departure from erupting into bloody violence.
In a statement on Monday supporting the December 2018 timetable, the US State Department said the DRC had taken "a significant step toward realizing its first peaceful, democratic transfer of power".
But it also noted "the importance" of Kabila abiding by the constitution and pledges reached under a compromise agreement last year to step down following elections.
The 46-year-old has been president since 2001 after taking over from his assassinated father, Laurent.
Separately, the UN peacekeeping mission in DRC, known as MONUSCO, on Wednesday said it "regretted" that the elections were being postponed again, but offered its help for organising them.
It also announced that a Tanzanian UN peacekeeper had died from his wounds after his unit was attacked on October 9.
Two other UN troops also died and 18 were wounded in the attack, which occurred near Beni, in the troubled province of North Kivu.
The assault was attributed to Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which is dominated by hardline Ugandan Muslims.
The ADF has been accused by Kinshasa and the UN mission of killing more than 700 people in the Beni region since October 2014.

Title: Ex-Rwandan PM Twagiramungu is special guest of Tanzanian President Kikwete - 24Tanzania.com
Days after announcing a coalition with Rwandan FDLR rebels based in DR Congo, former prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu is a special guest of Tanzania’s president Jakaya Kikwete, according to sources in Dodoma, Tanzania.The ex-PM Faustin Twagiramungu is the current face of the extremist political views on the Rwandan political sceneTwagiramungu arrived in Tanzania on Sunday 19thJanuary and has been hosted at secret locations under the direct protection of President Kikwete’s official detail, say the sources.The former prime minister has been living in Belgium since 1995, and returned to contest in the 2003 Rwanda presidential polls in which he got 3.62 percent. After the humiliating defeat at the hands of incumbent President Paul Kagame, Twagiramungu immediately left the country and has never set foot in Rwanda.Over the years, he has formed different political groups, from which he has become a fierce critic of the government of Rwanda. Twagiramungu’s current political organization is RDI-RWANDA RWIZA. Most of its members have abandoned the group, choosing to return to Rwanda.On January 14th, Twagiramungu announced that he was going into coalition with Rwandan FDLR rebels who are accused of executing the genocide in Rwanda and fled to DR Congo back in 1994. Twagiramungu’s move followed that of another group PS Imberakuri days earlier, based inside Rwanda.Twagiramungu’s presence in Tanzania is not surprising, said our sources in Tanzania. President Kikwete is the only world leader who has come out with a public endorsement of the FDLR. The group has been vilified world over for being unapologetic about the genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda.On 26thJune 2013, President Kikwete made the unthinkable. During a closed-door African Union heads of state special summit on DRC in Ethiopia, President Kikwete called for talks between the government of Rwanda and the FDLR.The months that followed saw a near-complete breakdown of relations between Kigali and Dodoma, as Rwandan officials and ordinary population believed they had a serious large enemy on its eastern border. Rwanda foreign affairs minister Louise Mushikiwabo was so angry that she described President Kikwete in subsequent media interviews, as “spokesman” of FDLR.However, Tanzania’s connections with the FDLR are not new. Around mid-last year, FDLR deputy commander General Stanislas Nzeyimana (aka Izabayo Bigaruka) was announced to be in Tanzania. But weeks later, news surfaced that he had disappeared – prompting questions as to why he was in Tanzania in the first place.In Twagiramungu forming alliance with the FDLR, the rowdy politician said in a statement last week that he wants to force the government in Rwanda out by use of arms. Before January 2014, no Rwandan political organization or international group has ever given public backing to the FDLR.Twagiramungu now falls within the FDLR agenda which does not agree with existing global agreement that Tutsis were targeted in Rwanda, in a clearly planned mass slaughter set in motion by the government at the time. The FDLR agenda is to return the extremist politicking in which Rwanda lived through for years before 1994.SourceNews of Rwanda

Title: Elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: How Democratic? - Fair Observer

An analysis of the upcoming general election in November.
On November 28, legislative and presidential elections are to be held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This is the second time in five years that the Congolese people will freely vote since the DRC gained independence from Belgium 51 years ago. Since its independence, the country went through thirty-two years of absolute dictatorial rule under Mobutu Sese Seko, then plunged into multi-pronged internal conflicts that have since been dubbed Africa’s World War, and whose pangs are still reverberating to date—swaths of territories in eastern and northern Congo are ungovernable as armed militias from Rwanda and Uganda continue to perpetrate atrocities on civilian populations — most publicized have been the devastating gang rapes and mutilations of women.
These wars have drawn armed forces from half a dozen African countries into the DRC and have led to , directly or indirectly, the deaths of five million Congolese citizens. The gravity of this situation warranted the intervention of the international community and led to the deployment of the world’s largest UN peacekeeping forces. A settlement of the conflict was brokered, whereby the warring factions’ armed militias would integrate and be forged into the national army. Their movements morphed into political parties — with erstwhile warlords as well as civil society representatives forming a transitional government in 2003 with a bicameral legislature comprising 500-member National Assembly and a 108-member Senate.
The transitional government had a bizarre arrangement, comprising the incumbent Joseph Kabila as president and four vice-presidents (two former warlords, one representative of the civil society, and one representative of the central government). The transitional government was therefore known as “1 + 4.”
The first test of this post-conflict peace project was a new constitution adopted upon a referendum in 2005. After passage, it became the fundamental law of the land in early 2006. One political party, theUnion pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social(UDPS) of the veteran anti-Mobutu oppositionist Etienne Tshisekedi, boycotted the process—just as it did the general elections that followed in July 2006.
The second test of the peace project was the legislative and presidential elections. In the first round of those elections, there were thirty-two presidential candidates and more than 9,000 aspirants vying to fill 500 seats in the National Assembly. Constitutionally, the 108 senators were to be indirectly elected by provincial assemblies. Two candidates emerged after the first round: the incumbent Joseph Kabila—whose party, theParti du Peuple pour la Reconstruction et le Développement(PPRD), had contracted an alliance with several political parties to create the platform calledAlliance de la Majorité Présidentielle(AMP), and erstwhile warlord and one of the transitional presidents, Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the militia turned political party, theMouvement de Libération du Congo(MLC), which also had its allies gathered in a political cartel calledUnion pour la Nation(UN).
Bemba contested the results of both rounds of these elections, and as he had a small force for his protection in the capital, his men and Kabila’s Presidential Guard clashed twice in the Congolese capital—once after each round of the election.In the second clash between the forces of the two presidential contenders, the Presidential Guard routed their opponents, forcing Bemba to seek refuge in the compound of the South African embassy, which ultimately obtained from the government a safe passage to Europe for the former Vice-President, who, by then, had also been elected senator by the provincial assembly of his stronghold of Kinshasa. While in Europe, Bemba was arrested in Belgium and transferred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague to face trial on charges of crimes against humanity for the alleged atrocities committed by his rebel troops he had loaned to the then-president of the Central African Republic (CAR) Ange Patassé to put down a coup attempt in that neighboring country. Bemba is still on trial and in custody at the ICC.
Kabila won the second round of the 2006 presidential election with 58% of the vote, whereas Bemba obtained 42%. However, the results of these elections showed that the country was divided into two linguistic blocs: the western Lingala-speaking provinces voting en masse for Bemba, and the eastern Swahili-speaking provinces casting their lot for the incumbent, a Swahili-speaker and whose late father, the assassinated president Laurent-Désiré Kabila, hailed from the mining province of Katanga. Incidentally, Katangans see Joseph Kabila as one of their own, though he grew up in Tanzania and only came to the DRC as a rebel officer alongside the Rwandan-backed revolutionaries.
The context in the general elections of this year is dramatically different. Earlier this year, the National Assembly, dominated by the incumbent’s political cartel and amid the outcry of opposition deputies who boycotted the move, voted to change a few provisions in the constitution, including scrapping the requirement of two rounds in the presidential election in the event that none of the two candidates achieved 50% plus 1 vote in the first round.
This constitutional amendment puts immense pressure on the rival opposition to rally around one candidate so as to get a realistic chance at staking a claim on the presidency,“lest the increasingly unpopular Kabila wins the 2011 race by default,”as is alleged in a US Kinshasa Embassy cable created on January 20, 2010, and recently released by WikiLeaks.
As it turns out, the opposition is as divided as ever—though, at first blush, it appears that it was dealt a good hand in this electoral cycle. Tshisekedi has chosen to participate in the process this time around and, at age 78, still shows skills in mobilizing crowds of activists and sympathizers. There is also new blood injected into the opposition that could prove quite a challenge for the incumbent. Among the emerging leaders is Vital Kamerhe, the incumbent’s own 2006 campaign manager and former speaker of the National Assembly, who had run afoul of his former boss for publicly questioning the wisdom of the president in striking a deal with Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame that entailed Rwandan-Congolese joint military operations in eastern Congo to root out Rwandan terrorists of the FDLR (Democratic Forces of the Liberation of Rwanda).
These joint military operations failed to yield the expected results. The FDLR elements still roam around in some pockets of eastern Congo. Besides, there is an ongoing snag in the reform of the security sector. The integration into the national army of formerly Rwandan-backed rebels and other militias known as “Mai-Mai” (who had resisted Rwandan occupation during ‘Africa’s World War’) is only nominal: these armed groups keep their chain of command intact and stay on the territory previously controlled by them. What’s more, donning the national army fatigues, these ex-militiamen continue to perpetrate atrocities in the region—their crimes matching in savagery those of the FDLR: mass rapes, looting of villages, and wanton massacres. In the northern province of Orientale, by the border with the Republic of South Sudan and the Central African Republic, raids on villages by elements of the Ugandan vicious militia,Lord’s Resistance Army(LRA), continue unabated. This situation of insecurity creates a mockery of the slogan: “crafter of peace,” on which the incumbent ran in 2006.
This deleterious security situation is doubly worrisome to Kabila for two reasons. First, the endemic insecurity in the eastern region has dented the popularity he once enjoyed in his stronghold, which now has growing number of disgruntled constituents. Second, this state of affairs plays right into the hands of Kamerhe, who is from the eastern province of South Kivu.
Kamerhe has turned into a tough foe, with name recognition and alliances he has succeeded in forging nationwide, including in the restive southwestern province of Bas-Congo, with powerful leaders such as MP Ne Muanda Nsemi, head of the banned cargo-cultBundu dia Mayala.
Another presidential contender of note to emerge is the Senate president, Léon Kengo wa Dondo, a three-time Prime Minister of Mobutu, a qualification that makes his appeal to voters doubtful.
The only option for the opposition would be to rally around the one leader who has a clear chance of defeating the incumbent, either Tshisekedi or Kamerhe. But nothing remotely close to this scenario is happening.
One issue is that the division within the opposition has deepened lately, as Tshisekedi has ratched up talks with the 11 other opposition presidential candidates vying to unseat Kabila. He even recently visited Bemba for the second time at the Scheveningen Prison Complex in the Netherlands in an attempt to secure the backing of the MLC in the upcoming presidential elections.
The opposition has further diluted its strength, considering it comprises a staggering number of 417 non-aligned registered political parties with more than 19,000 MP candidates. Kabila’s party PPRD, by contrast, has allied itself with more than 200 parties.
The real concern in the run-up to the November elections is violence, which has already flared up on several occasions in the confrontations pitting UDPS supporters against PPRD party members, or when riot police have violently repressed UDPS demonstrators. Additionally, UDPS doubts the autonomy of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) from the ruling party. Some fear that these elements turn the country into a powder keg that might explode after the election in the event that Kabila is reelected.
UDPS and other opposition parties affiliated with it are requiring access to CENI’s central server as well as an audit of the electoral registers. CENI has accepted this demand from the opposition but on condition that the ruling majority also participate, which the latter adamantly refuses, accusing UDPS and its allies of engaging in maneuvers to derail the electoral process. Besides, CENI discovered that there were more than 100,000 duplicate voters’ registrations — some due to technical glitches and others due to attempted electoral fraud . CENI vowed to drag those responsible to court. Some independent analysts actually estimate that the number of these duplicate voters might be as high as 700,000. UDPS sees this as a sure sign that a massive vote rigging scheme is in the offing.
The UN stabilization mission in the DRC, which is helping in the logistics of the elections by deploying electoral kits countrywide and alongside Western diplomatic missions in Kinshasa, is strongly urging political parties to carry out peaceful electoral campaigns and to accept the results of the ballot box. Whether this advice will be heeded or not remains to be seen.
