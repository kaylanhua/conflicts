Title: UPDF Speaks Out On The Missing M23 Commander Sultani Makenga - ONLINE

By Serestino Tusingwire
The Uganda People’s Defence Forces have washed themselves clean of sanctioned M23 Military Commander Sultani Makenga.
Makenga who was under UPDF’s protection went missing a few weeks ago together with over 750 other combatants that were held at the Bihanga Military Training School.
“Makenga was never in prison, he was in a house and we had made sure that nobody would come from out and attack him or harm him. But as regard to his movement, he was a free man,” Brig. Richard Karemire, army spokesperson said.
The disappearance that coincidentally happened around the renewed clashes in Eastern DRC raises some tough questions for the future of security in the region.
“M23 issue is basically the problem of DRC. We are just victims because of geography,” Karemire said.
Karemire also noted that after reports that Makenga went missing, they informed the DRC government which sent its delegates and were given a clear account of the matter.

Title: 16 rebels killed in fighting with army in DRC's east | News24
Friday, 20 September
23 Feb 2017
Beni - The Democratic Republic of Congo's army has killed at least 16 former members of a rebel group after they re-entered the country's east, the military's spokesperson said Thursday.
Fighting near Rutshuru began on Wednesday and by Thursday the army had captured 68 former M23 rebels and 39 others surrendered, said Major Ndjike Kaiko.
"We are tracking the fleeing M23 fighters who are seeking to infiltrate Kinyandoni and into the Virunga National Park," he said.
M23 launched its rebellion in eastern DRC in April 2012, becoming the latest group of Tutsi rebels dissatisfied with DRC's government.
It was repulsed by UN forces and DRC's army in 2013.
Many rebels fled to Rwanda and Uganda before a 2013 peace agreement was signed with the government and the group disbanded.
But in January DRC's government warned that the former rebels in Uganda were re-grouping and crossing back into the country.
Uganda's government said that hundreds of members of the rebel group in January fled a military camp there where they had been awaiting amnesty, and cautioned that many had been quietly infiltrating into the general public.
DRC residents said on Thursday they are terrified of the group's return.
Eastern DRC has been plagued by many armed rebel groups since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Title: Intel hub set up in Uganda to fight ADF - New Vision Official
Feb 19, 2017
PIC: Members of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) pose after launching the intelligence nerve centre in Kasese on Saturday. (AFP)Countries in Africa's Great Lakes region launched an intelligence nerve centre in Uganda Saturday to better coordinate the fight against a rebel group responsible for massacres in neighbouring DR Congo.A string of bloody killings in which civilians have mostly been hacked to death around the town of Beni in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo has left nearly 700 dead since 2014.The bloodbath has been blamed on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a shadowy group dominated by hardline Ugandan Muslims which has never claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, and whose basic motives and ideology remain unclear.The centre in Kasese in Uganda, which is near the DRC border and suffered several ADF attacks in the late nineties, will be manned by eight security experts from Uganda, DRC, Tanzania and Kenya, with an unspecified number of staff working under them."Once the intelligence information is received at the centre, it will be analysed by the experts, further investigated and disseminated to member countries for action," said Uganda army spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire.The centre started with initial capital of $600,000 (565,000 euros) according to the executive secretary of the regional Great Lakes bloc ICGLR, Zachary Muburi Muita, and is financed by the four core member states.A Ugandan police officer stands guard at the Mpondwe check point at the border with DR Congo near Kasese district, about 340 kilometres west of the capital Kampala. (AFP)The ADF started out with the aim of overthrowing Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, who was seen as hostile to Muslims. But it went on to absorb other rebel factions into its ranks and started carrying out attacks in 1995.Gradually pushed westwards by the Ugandan army, the ADF relocated most of its activities to the DRC.When the Beni massacres started in October 2014, the ADF was quickly branded the culprit by both Congolese authorities and the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO.Kinshasa has insisted on a jihadist motive to the killings. But many observers and experts say there has been no proven link with the global jihadist underground, and that this is a "simplistic" explanation for their acts.Many ADF recruits -- drawn from Tanzania, Burundi, Kenya and as far as Somalia -- are not hardcore ideologues but young Muslims lured by the promise of going to study in Saudi Arabia, an intelligence agent and civil society source told AFP in December.A group run by US researcher Jason Stearns published a report in March claiming several distinct groups "appear to be involved in the massacres", including soldiers from the regular army.The government rejected the claims and Stearns was expelled from DRC after the report's release.Beni's mayor Bwanakawa Nyonyi told AFP last year he believes the massacres are carried out by a nebulous group, with politically-motivated "Congolese hands" behind them.In explaining the violence, some have cited struggles for control of trafficking in various industries like timber, agricultural produce or minerals in a region with extremely rich potential.

KASESE: Countries in Africa's Great Lakes region launched an intelligence nerve centre in Uganda Saturday to better coordinate the fight against a rebel group responsible for massacres in neighbouring DR Congo.
A string of bloody killings in which civilians have mostly been hacked to death around the town of Beni in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo has left nearly 700 dead since 2014.

Title: Fear hangs over busy Uganda - DRC border post | News24
Friday, 20 September
24 Feb 2017
Mpondwe - The jagged, ice-capped Rwenzori Mountains stab at the sky above Mpondwe, a bustling border town in western Uganda.
Trucks move slowly and one at a time across a rickety metal bridge above the swirling, muddy Lhubiriha River and into the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where, traders say, profits can be found but fear lurks.
"We have no worries here, but our concern is the security over there," says Henry Bwambale, a 34-year-old business leader in Mpondwe, gesturing to the west.
Traders tell of violent highway robbery and worse on the roads to the Congolese towns of Butembo and Beni, he says.
"We have heard of people being killed, hacked to death and homes torched. People are beheaded," he says.
Simon Mufalume, a 52-year-old Ugandan trader, no longer crosses the border himself, preferring to sell to middlemen. "Crossing to DRC to do business is risky," he says.
Recklessness, however, can be richly rewarded.
"Basic items are expensive because we don't have industries," says Wilberforce Kanga, a 59-year-old Congolese businessman from Beni. "The traders who risk, and cross, make huge profits."
Risky business
The DRC - Uganda border region has a tradition of insurrection driven by ethnic divisions, political marginalisation and economic neglect.
But blame for much of the violence in recent years is put on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel group of Muslim fighters that evolved from a domestic force in the mid-1990s into a brutally destabilising militia operating in the borderlands around the Rwenzori Mountains.
Fear of attack has led Jude Mwanankambo, a 41-year-old Congolese businessman, to split his life, living in DRC by day and Uganda by night.
"There the security is not guaranteed, armed men come to you at night and demand money," he says one evening in Mpondwe.
"Some gunmen are vicious! If you don't give them money or goods they can kill you so I cross to Uganda in the evening and return the next morning."
To ease his strain Mwanankambo has a wife on each side of the border.
Mpondwe is growing, if not booming.
Multi-storey buildings burst up from the surrounding tin-roofed huts, a paved road has replaced the old dirt one and the government is there, at least in the form of border security and customs and immigration offices.
Stockpiles of goods and busy markets are in stark contrast with the Congolese side of the border where traders do not dally, quickly disappearing into the dense forest.
Militia without a mission
Last week a regional intelligence centre was opened in the nearby Ugandan town of Kasese, manned by security officers from Uganda, DRC, Tanzania and Kenya to address the ADF threat.
Repeated claims of ADF links to other Islamists, such as the Shabaab in Somalia, are made but rarely supported and commonly dismissed by analysts.
But the ADF need not be Islamic terrorists to be a threat.
The group announced its presence with an attack on Mpondwe in November 1996 that left bodies littering the streets.
In the five years that followed researchers estimate at least 1 000 people were killed and 150 000 forced from their homes as the ADF went on an increasingly random rampage, attacking civilians as well as government and military targets.
Former ADF fighter Ramadhan Byarugaba, 57, who lives in Kasese after leaving the group as part of a Ugandan amnesty programme says the group "has lost its mission".
"The government said they wanted to overthrow us in Uganda, but they are killing people in DRC. Why? Is killing innocent people part of their mission?" he asks.
Wave of killings
Its brutal methods are not in question, but whether the ADF is behind all the attacks and criminality is.
The ADF is not the only predatory armed group in the area: DRC's own army, as well as local Mai-Mai militia and remnants of other rebellions including the Rwandan genocidaires are all present - and a threat to civilians.
The Congolese government and the UN mission, Monusco, have blamed a brutal wave of killings that has left at least 700 people dead since October 2014 on the ADF.
But a report last year by the New York-based Congo Research Group questioned this narrative.
The author of the report, which implicated government soldiers in some of the killings, was expelled from the country.
And AFP journalists were strongly advised after the bloodbath not to delve too deeply into the Beni area's security matters.
Still, people from the area do not just blame the ADF.
"We have many groups killing people," says Roselyn Kambaare, a 34-year-old mother of five who fled Beni in 2014, after one of the massacres.
But for her, exactly who is doing the killing matters less than stopping it. "We have suffered for long," she says.

Title: Rwanda ‘committed to DRC peace deal’ - 24Tanzania.com
Rwanda has reiterated its commitment to the UN-backed Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region, and urged all signatories to the agreement, signed in February, to help translate it into action.Rwanda’s Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo“We believe it offers a realistic path to lasting peace and security for the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region at large,” Foreign Affairs minister Louis Mushikiwabo said during a US-convened United Nations Security Council debate on the security situation in the Great Lakes Region yesterday. “But we must not veer off course, and we must understand that this vision is only achievable alongside regional peace initiatives, as well as genuine political will on the part of all affected states.”Rwanda is a signatory to the peace framework signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by 11 regional countries, with the UN, African Union, ICGLR and SADC signing as guarantors.Mushikiwabo said there was need to end resurfacing insecurity in eastern Congo while ensuring long-term stability in the restive neighbouring country.She called for an end to the collaboration between the Congolese army, FARDC, and the FDLR militia, largely composed of elements blamed for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.“Rwanda requests concerned parties to halt any further threats to its territory and its population such as the recent bombing into Rubavu district from the DRC territory. Nor can the peace process withstand destructive military alliances… Rwanda remains seriously concerned.”She added: “While Rwanda views any alliance between the FDLR and FARDC as a threat to regional security, we will not allow these disturbing developments to derail our commitment to peace.”However DRC’s Foreign minister Raymond Tshibanda, addressing the same forum at the UN headquarters in New York, rejected these allegations, which Kigali made in an official complaint to the UN Security Council a fortnight ago.The Rwandan government has also accused the newly-formed Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), an offensive wing of the UN Stabilisation Mission in the Congo (Monusco) of supporting the FARDC-FDLR alliance, adding that the Brigade officers had also discussed with FDLR “matters related to their tactical and strategic collaboration”.But Tanzania, one of the FIB contributing countries, yesterday defended the 3000-plus force at the Security Council meeting.Rwanda charges that the Congolese army has joined hands with the FDLR as it battles the M23 rebels in the country’s east, following the collapse of peace talks between Kinshasa and the insurgents who took up arms last year blaming the government of breaching a 2009 peace deal with an earlier rebel movement.Speaking in New York yesterday, Mushikiwabo outlined Rwanda’s actions in keeping with its commitments under the Peace Framework, citing the disarmament and relocation away from the DRC border of some 600 M23 combatants who fled to Rwanda after they were defeated by a rival M23 faction.She urged the international community to come up with a solution regarding these former combatants, who have since denounced rebellion and sought asylum in Rwanda.Mushikiwabo also recalled that Rwanda facilitated the transfer of M23’s General Bosco Ntaganda to the International Criminal Court in The Hague after the warlord sneaked into the country and surrendered to the US embassy in Kigali in March.The minister said Rwanda also shelters some 70,000 Congolese refugees.Mushikiwabo called on other partners in the peace deal to implement their commitments, saying that the “time for words” had elapsed.She noted Rwanda and the region will not be at peace without a stable DRC.“A plan without action is just words and, when it comes to the eastern DRC, there have been enough words,” Mushikiwabo said. “This is the time for accountable parties to stand up and step forward. Now is the time for action.”Under the peace deal, the DRC government committed to strengthening its security and governance institutions to ensure the rule of law, especially in conflict-torn eastern Congo.All the signatory countries committed not to interfere in each other’s internal affairs.DRC’s Tshibanda said his government had made progress with regard to its commitments under the peace framework, including putting in place a national taskforce to champion the necessary reforms as agreed under the UN-sponsored regional deal.Several countries voiced their support for the Peace Framework but warned that the lasting solution to the recurrent conflict in eastern DRC lied in a political settlement, and called for resumption of ICGLR-brokered peace talks between Kinshasa and M23 rebels in the Ugandan capital Kampala.The debate was chaired by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July.By Eugene Kwibuka, The New Times

The debate was chaired by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July.

Title: Nyange School Attacked by FDLR Rebels Gets Rwf250m Facelift – KT PRESS
The Nyange School attack victims have been honoured as national heroes
In March 1997, insurgents that had been battling government forces attacked a secondary school in Ngororero district – killing students after they defied an order for Hutus to separate themselves so that Tutsi students are identified. By the end of March this year, it will be a completely different place.
Three years after the 1994 genocide against Tutsi was stopped by Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPA) rebels, the defeated ethnic extremist militia (or Ex-FAR) routinely crossed back from DR Congo to terrorize communities inside Rwanda.
The militia then locally known as ‘abacengezi’ crossed from neighbouring DRC and surrounded Nyange secondary school. The militia ordered those it branded as “Hutu” students in their dormitories to separate themselves from “Tutsi” students.
Students defied the militia orders saying; ‘We are all Rwandans’. The militia immediately killed all defiant students on spot while 19 sustained fatal injuries.  Six students died from the attack, and would later be honoured in the Imena national heroes’ category of individuals whose acts promote unity and reconciliation. Dormitories and other school property were destroyed.
A government –funded renovation program started in September last year to expand the school with an additional 20 classroom blocks. The first phase of the project will be completed in March 2017.
Some of the old blocks at the school which will be renovated and expanded
Officials from the Western Province have allocated Rwf250m (USD$310,000) for the renovation and expansion of the school. There are also plans to raise its status from a secondary school.
In May 2000, some three years following the Nyange attack and many others across north and western Rwanda, the ‘abacengezi’ changed their name to the currently so called democratic forces for the liberation of Rwanda  or FDLR.

Title: New challenges for transitional justice on the path to peace - JusticeInfo.net
“The times are they are a-changing”, Bob Dylan used to sing. The winner of the 2016 Nobel prize for literature was surely not thinking about transitional justice when he wrote those lines back in the 1960s. Yet times are also changing for transitional justice, which has become a key component of peace accords. But with new objectives come new challenges, and they are considerable.
Transitional justice was developed during the late 1980sand the following decade in the wave of optimism that followed the end of the Cold War. Defence budgets were falling, political and economic liberalism seemed here to stay, a bestseller predicted “the end of history” and the United States was the only superpower. Transitional justice embodied the process of negotiated transition that was taking place simultaneously in various parts of the world as authoritarian regimes gave way to democratic ones. The wars and crimes committed in former Yugoslavia, Chechnya and Somalia and the genocide in Rwanda certainly cast a shadow over this picture of reconciled humanity but did not fundamentally alter the optimism of the era, which is now gone.
Today we are living in a time of rising perils:finished are the dividends of peace and “the end of history”. History is moving forward and it is particularly bloody in the Middle East. Defence spending is rising in the West, in the Middle East and Asia, the number of refugees has never been so high since the creation of the UNHCR, nationalism and xenophobia are seducing electorates hit by rising economic inequality, the US President is advocating torture while his counterpart in the Philippines boasts of extrajudicial killings he has carried out himself -- two eloquent signs of the regression of human rights.
Apart from a few exceptions, including the fragile Tunisian democracy, transitional justice is no longer there to mark the path to a democratic State. But transitional justice is not obsolete, even if it has lost its initial purpose. The mechanisms of transitional justice have become an essential part of processes to end conflict. In Colombia, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali and elsewhere, peace agreements include transitional justice tools or the whole toolbox. The UN sometimes plays an essential role as in the CAR, where the UN mission in the country supported the authorities in getting these justice mechanisms adopted in the “Republican Pact” of May 2015.
The fact that these tools are now being included comes in response to a clear fact: Fifty percent of peace agreements collapse within ten years. One of the reasons for this failure is that continuing impunity sows the seeds for a new round of violence as soon as one of the warring sides is no longer satisfied by the “deal”. Hence the need to end this vicious circle by strengthening rule of law and good governance, and gradually marginalizing the warlords. This is what is now at stake in transitional justice and the tools it has forged, such as Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, international tribunals, reparations programs and vetting processes for ex-combatants of armed groups wishing to join the State security services, to ensure that they have not committed war crimes.
The challenge is considerable especially in places where conflict has not ended and armed groups still control large parts of the country. This is the case in Mali and the CAR, for example, where transitional justice mechanisms have been created or are being set up but where the State remains notoriously weak.
It requires real determination on the part of the authorities to move forward on this path and share the goals with their people by sending unambiguous messages, as well as a real will to rally civil society,victims’ associations, religious platforms and human rights activists to the transitional justice process. It also means mobilizing the resources of the State and its partners to install a new balance of power that is less favorable to the armed groups.
That needs a strategy to gradually strengthen the authority of the State wherever possible, setting up courts and Truth Commissions in the parts of the country that have been secured. Hence the need also to work on the structural roots of the violence by fighting against corruption and ill-gotten gains, recognizing the rights of minorities and granting community reparations to groups that have been neglected by State development strategies.
Such are the ambitious challenges that must be taken up in order to strengthen social cohesion, re-establish trust between the authorities and the people and embark on a slow and difficult process to rebuild and redeploy the State.
