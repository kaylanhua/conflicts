Title: Rebellion and Conflict Minerals in North Kivu – ACCORD
The province of North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has seen little respite from conflict in more than two decades. It was here that the ethnic violence that preceded the First Congo War broke out in 1993 and it is here that the conflict continues to the present day. The defeat of the largest rebel group,Mouvement du 23 Mars(M23), in November 2013 has only served to further fragment the armed group landscape, and there are currently more than 70 groups active in the region.1

In 2003, an armistice agreement brought peace to most of the DRC. But the eastern provinces, and particularly North Kivu, remained restive. Why? Most media accounts focus on the illegal exploitation of mineral resources that is thought to generate violence in three ways: national and foreign actors compete for control of the mining sites; groups are able to finance their operations; and groups employ violence against civilians to gain control over resource-rich areas, or the ability to exploit them.2Indeed, minerals are considered so closely linked to violence they have been dubbed “the engines of chaos”.3
By early 2004, the peace process was already starting to unravel in North Kivu. Under the terms of the deal, all belligerents were to join a transitional government and merge their forces into one national army. However, it quickly became clear that not all parties were fully committed to peace. An early sign of this was the defection of three senior Rally forCongoleseDemocracy (RCD) officers – among them Laurent Nkunda – to form a political movement that morphed into the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) rebellion in July 2006. The region was once again plunged into turmoil, with fighting reaching the intensity of the Second Congo War.4Whilst Mai Mai (self-defence militias) were responsible for some of this violence, the struggle between the CNDP and theForces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda(FDLR) – the largest Rwandan Hutu group – was at its heart.
The CNDP captured substantial territory in North Kivu and took steps to establish alternative administration structures. A police force was set up, some school fees and health bills paid and communal labour organised to repair the roads. Money was raised by exacting taxes on “everything from small kiosks to mining and the charcoal trade”.5Unable to defeat the CNDP militarily, DRC authorities struck a deal with Rwanda (backers of the CNDP and providers of protection for the group’s leader, Nkunda) that brought the rebellion to a sudden end in late 2008.
Under new leadership, the CNDP signed a peace accord in Goma in March 2009, which allowed the group to keep its command structures in place. When moves were made to dismantle these, a splinter group launched the M23 rebellion in May 2012. A series of offences captured the territorial capital of Rutshuru, the Bunagana border and the military base of Rumangabo. This run of success swelled M23’s ranks and it took steps to legitimise itself by strengthening its political wing, setting up a tax collection network and liaising with humanitarian workers in the areas under its control.6
In November 2012, M23 occupied Goma. But the occupation, along with the publication of a report by the United Nations (UN) Group of Experts, put the spotlight on the support M23 was receiving from Rwanda. Several Western countries, including the United States (US), suspended financial aid to Rwanda – and Rwanda, in turn, cut its support to M23. Peace talks began, but were conducted in only a desultory manner by both sides. However, the talks did precipitate a split in M23, whose leadership was divided over what position to take. In late October 2013, following suspension of the peace talks, the DRC army, assisted by the Intervention Brigade and UN troops, launched a successful offensive. Within two weeks, the rebel group had been driven from all its strongholds in North Kivu and completely defeated.7
The economic dimensions of civil war and the existence of a “resource curse” have been of keen interest to researchers since the late 1990s. Paul Collier8was the first to draw an explicit link between reliance on primary commodities and the onset of civil war, theorising that belligerents entered into conflicts to benefit materially. Rebel movements might identify themselves in terms of grievances, but in reality these were little more than self-serving justifications. Later work qualified the initial theory by emphasising the role of feasibility: civil war is still caused by greed, but mostly likely will occur in environments where an economic base can sustain it.9There is no place in the feasibility hypothesis for the idea that rebellion can be a legitimate response to state criminality. In North Kivu, state officials in some capacity have been responsible for most human rights violations. This sanctioned criminality has exacerbated the already massive social and economic inequalities and created “genuine and extreme grievances”.10
In addition to the feasibility perspective, it has been theorised that the availability of natural resources shapes the dynamics of rebel movements. There are two aspects to this. First, resource riches enable groups to recruit on the basis of short-term rewards. This leads to the ranks being swelled by opportunistic joiners who have little commitment to the cause. Second, economically motivated leaders will gradually come to the fore. Whilst the evidence that fighters join for financial reasons remains tentative, the tendency for groups to favour economic motivations over time has more empirical backing. The process of “economisation” – whereby groups gradually reorient towards profiting from the opportunities opened up by war – was one of the defining features of the Second Congo War.11
The CNDP is thought to have earned only 15% of its revenue from the mineral trade.12However, this information must be qualified by recognising that the CNDP seems to be something of an outlier – with other groups, the percentage was far higher. M23 followed a similar pattern. According to an International Peace Information Service (IPIS)13report, M23 was not involved in the mining sector, and control over minerals was not a priority for the group. During the roughly 18-month period the group was at its peak, it made no attempt to target mining sites, nor did it conduct mineral exports through the areas under its control. The group mainly financed its rebellion by levying taxes on households and transport.14
This does not mean M23 failed to profit from the mineral trade. A significant measure of the group’s transport tax revenue came from the export of coltan and cassiterite across the Goma/Gisenyi border. M23 also had traders in its employ, and benefited from the “liberation” of significant stocks of minerals. The group probably calculated that there was no need for it physically to occupy the mines when it controlled the routes in and out of the region. This could be linked with the mineral being mined: metals like tin, coltan and wolframite are only valuable in bulk and therefore can be taxed easily at border crossings or on roads. Direct control of diamond and gold mines could be more important. Furthermore, fieldwork and research has shown that while only a small number of sites are under the direct control of armed groups, all levels of the mineral supply chain are vulnerable to exploitation.15
Whilst both the CNDP and M23 made money from mineral resources, it was not their primary motivation or their main source of income. The measure of popular support they had, along with the fact they were strong enough to control territory, meant that taxation and transport taxes made up the bulk of their income. These two forms of income are not unconnected to the mineral trade, so it would be unwise to make any sweeping claims. However, the impact of the mining embargo seems to support Johnson’s assertion that the “the existence of a trade in minerals is not a factor favouring either conflict or its absence in North Kivu”.16This dynamic is clear when the trajectory of the trade in coltan is considered. Whilst a price boom in the early 2000s led many groups to finance their operations by trading in coltan, once the price of the mineral dropped, it returned to being just one of many income streams, which included everything from gold and tin to wildlife and theft of consumer goods.17
Field research by Laudati18draws attention to the predatory and informal “economy of violence” that has taken root in the region. Roadblocks, the levying of taxes, profits from forest resources (charcoal, timber and hemp), the pillaging of livestock and organised theft all contribute to the income of the various rebel groups.
Income is also generated from non-mineral goods that form the basis of the everyday economy. No activity, no matter how low level, escapes predation, and products as seemingly small as milk, cheese and palm oil are also targeted.
There is a widespread perception that the CNDP and M23 were Rwandan proxies created to continue the profiteering that began in earnest during the Second Congo War. Although Rwanda remains deeply involved with mining activities in North Kivu, security concerns rather than economic interests are the primary motivation.19The most pressing of these concerns is the continued presence of FDLR remnants in the area. There is also a general distrust of the DRC government, which is viewed as weak, corrupt and unable to keep order in its eastern territories.
That being said, the support M23 received from the Rwandan government has been well documented. According to testimony given to Stearns20by Ugandan officials and former M23 members, Rwanda was involved with the group from its inception. The UN Group of Experts21reported that the Rwandan government provided direct military support, “facilitating recruitment, encouraging and facilitating desertions from the armed forces of the DRC, and providing arms, ammunition, intelligence and political advice.”
Since the end of the 1990s, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Global Witness have campaigned for anti-“conflict-minerals” initiatives and legislation, on the grounds that profits from these minerals fuel conflicts. These campaigns led to the creation of a UN Panel of Inquiry – which, in turn, led to a raft of legislation being passed or projects being set up to reform the mining sector.22In July 2010, the US Dodd-Frank Act was passed and, shortly afterwards, the DRC government suspended mining in the eastern provinces in what amounted to a de facto embargo on minerals emanating from the Kivus. However, the ban did not have the result intended. Armed groups seemed barely effected by the loss of income from minerals, quickly diversifying their income streams.23
The Congo wars had a devastating effect on the DRC economy. Agricultural communities were devastated, and the scarcity of land means young men cannot turn to farming. Large-scale criminal operations remain widespread. However, the assumption of “greed” prevalent in some theories of resources and conflict is inaccurate. For most of those involved, the mineral trade is simply a way to get by in a society where poverty is endemic.
Although natural resources did not cause the wars in the DRC, there was a progressive “economisation” whereby the violence became increasingly motivated by profit.24By the end of the Second Congo War, this pattern was established and powerful people were making a great deal of money. It would be tempting to see the CNDP and M23 rebellions as a continuation of this process. Both were “top-down” rebellions that began as army mutinies, and the enrichment of these movement’s leaders is well documented.25We can perhaps see evidence of Weinstein’s theory of a “resource curse” within the dynamics of a rebel movement in the trajectory of the CNDP and M23. The first M23 mutiny collapsed after a few days, with most ex-CNDP troops returning to the army. Reportedly, the soldiers were tired of seeing their commanders get rich.
Although rebel groups use these resources to fund their operations, it does not follow that they are the driving force of the conflict. If this were the case, military activities would focus on establishing direct control over resource-rich areas. This has not been the case in North Kivu, where there has been no fighting around control of significant mining sites.26It is also true that the Grand Nord part of the region has seen far less violence, despite being home to the gold and diamond mining sites that resource theory suggests rebels would find most attractive.27
It is clear that minerals have been a powerful factor in the conflicts, but the exact relationship between North Kivu’s resource wealth and the waging of war is harder to decipher than mainstream discourse captures. Le Billon28notes that primary commodities are “highly amenable to taxing and looting” and therefore a means of “escalating and prolonging” conflict. But whilst both M23 and CNDP made money from mineral resources, it was not their primary motivation or their main source of income. The rebellions were about demographics, citizenship and land rights and were fuelled not by greed but by the belief that the DRC government was not able or willing to protect the Tutsi community.29The existence of a thriving mineral trade is not, in the words of Dominic Johnson, “a factor favouring either conflict or its absence in North Kivu.”30It is therefore crucial that attempts to reach a better understanding of violence in the region focus on political and social causes, rather than economic ones.

Title: Congo's Kabila wants to conclude talks with rebels - 24Tanzania.com
Kinshasa and Congo’s M23 rebels failed to seal the deal after squabbles over what it should be called – the insurgents were ready to sign a peace agreement but Congo wanted to call it a declaration that reflected the rebels’ military defeat.
M23 are the latest incarnation of Tutsi-led insurgents who have battled Congo’s government in eastern regions for more than two decades.
The cycle of conflict fuelled by competition over land and mineral wealth has undermined the stability of the surrounding region and Congo had regularly accused its eastern neighbors Rwanda and Uganda of backing the insurgents – a charge they both deny.
After the November 11 signing ceremony in Uganda fell through, the Democratic Republic of Congo said Uganda, which was mediating the talks, had favored the rebels.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni met on Monday in Uganda’s capital to discuss the deal.
“The two presidents agreed that the Kampala dialogue between the government of the DRC and M23 should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible,” the Congolese statement said. The Ugandan announcement repeated the message, with minor variations in the text.
They did not say what a final deal should look like.
The statements also said a swift conclusion to the talks would “facilitate the peaceful return of M23 ex-combatants and the completion of the process of demobilization. This would further create appropriate conditions for the return of Congolese refugees living in neighboring countries.”
When the signing fell apart, Uganda said wrangling was over the title of the document rather than its content, which addressed issues such as offering an amnesty for those involved in the act of rebellion but not for war crimes.
It tackled the reintegration of rebels into the army as well as some of the root causes of the unrest, including issues surrounding the return of Tutsi refugees to Congo.
Congo’s failure to sign raised questions over its willingness to reach a political deal with a rebel force it has defeated militarily, analysts said.

Title: Uganda moves to freeze Mukulu's assets in Tanzania - New Vision Official
Apr 12, 2017
KAMPALA -Almost two years after his arrest, government of Uganda through the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) is moving to freeze the assets of Jamil Mukulu(pictured), the former elusive leader of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).In April 2015, Mukulu was arrested in Tanzania after close to two decades on the run.  ADF is a rebel group in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and is considered a terrorist organization by the Ugandan government.Started in the mid-1990s, ADF had spawned a reign of terror in DRC, and occasionally staged deadly incursions into Uganda - including the grisly attack on Kichwamba College which killed over 50 students."Our team is currently in Tanzania on a mission to freeze every known asset of Jamil Mukulu," DPP Justice Mike Chibita told lawmakers sitting on the legal and parliamentary affairs committee earlier on Wednesday.Its now customary practice in international law for governments to block financial channels of groups deemed to be terrorist in order to curtail their operations.Before his ran out of luck in April 2015, Mukulu, despite an Interpol red alert hanging over his head like a Damocles sword was allegedly able to run a lucrative business empire straddling the Kenya-Tanzanian border under a string of aliases.Mukulu has since been charged with multiple counts of murder in the Jinja High Court.

“The persistent activities of illegal armed groups remain one of the main threats to the security of the population and the stability of the DRC and the region,” said Said Djinnit, the Special Envoy for theGreat Lakes Regiontold the Security Council.

He said there is a need to boost efforts to neutralize these armed groups, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), building on the progress made so far by the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) with the support of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO).
“In this regard, it is important to further strengthen cooperation between these two forces. It is also important, as underlined by Security Council resolution 2348, that the Intervention Brigade, with the support of MONUSCO as a whole, increases its offensive operations against these armed groups,” he underscored.
Djinnit went on to welcome the launch by the DRC, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on 18 February of the Joint Monitoring Mechanism to respond to the growing threat posed by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). “I call on all participating countries to contribute actively to this mechanism and to provide it with the necessary resources to enable it to fulfil its mission effectively,” he said.
Overall, the Special Envoy encouraged the countries of the Great Lakes region “to continue their efforts by taking measures to address the problem of illegal armed groups.”
Regarding the political situation in the DRC, Djinnit called on Congolese political actors to scrupulously implement the 31 December Agreement, in order to create the conditions for the holding of transparent and inclusive elections.
“I urge them to refrain from any action that could lead to violence,” he said, reiterating the readiness of the UN to support the Congolese parties in the implementation of that Agreement.
Reporting some progress on the implementation of the region’s Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, he said that he had also witnessed promising steps towards strengthening economic cooperation.
“I encourage the signatory countries to continue to engage in joint development projects that contribute to further enhancing regional integration and stability,” he stated.
The Framework,signed byAngola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania – encompasses commitments at the national, regional and international levels to bring peace and stability to the eastern DRC and the region.(SOURCE:UN).

Reporting some progress on the implementation of the region's Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, he said that he had also witnessed promising steps towards strengthening economic cooperation. "I encourage the signatory countries to continue to engage in joint development projects that contribute to further enhancing regional integration and stability," he stated.
The Framework, signed by Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania – encompasses commitments at the national, regional and international levels to bring peace and stability to the eastern DRC and the region.



Title: DRC: Populations at Risk - Imminent Risk (17 April 2017) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
Populations in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo remain at risk of possible mass atrocity crimes perpetrated by armed groups. Postponed presidential elections have also resulted in political violence and increased instability.
BACKGROUND:
Pervasive insecurity in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has allowed armed groups to perpetrate mass atrocity crimes against civilians. Violence resulting from tensions between DRC authorities and a local militia following the killing of their chief, Kamuina Nsapu, has resulted in over 400 people killed in Kasaï, Kasaï Central and Kasaï Oriental provinces since August 2016. The UN human rights office in the DRC (UNJHRO) reported on 31 March that it is investigating 23 mass graves found in the Kasai region. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted that Kamuina Nsapu has perpetrated atrocities against civilians and that the government's armed forces (FARDC) has used disproportionate force in its response to the militia. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, of the 2.2 million internally displaced persons in the DRC, over 1 million are in the Kasaï region.
Populations in the region have witnessed increased clashes during February and March. On 9-13 February the army reportedly killed over 100 people, including 39 women, during clashes with the group. The government has stated that it will investigate videos showing FARDC soldiers shooting men and women who allegedly belonged to a militia in Muenza Nsapu village. Following clashes in mid-March Kamuina Nsapu reportedly ambushed and killed 40 police officers on 24-25 March. In addition, on 28 March the bodies of two members of the UN's Panel of Experts for the DRC were found in Kasaï Central province.
Other armed groups continue to utilize ongoing instability and the absence of state authority in eastern DRC to attack security forces and perpetrate crimes against civilians. Such groups – including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and various Mayi-Mayi militias – have been operating in the DRC for more than 20 years and continue to sporadically attack vulnerable populations in a region that is home to 1.9 million internally displaced persons.
Despite offensives conducted by the FARDC with assistance from the UN's stabilization mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and its force intervention brigade, violence committed by dozens of armed groups continues throughout the eastern DRC. Inter-communal clashes have sparked violence in North Kivu, particularly between armed groups affiliated with the FDLR, and those affiliated with ethnic Nandes. Elsewhere in North Kivu the ADF and other armed groups have been sporadically attacking villages near Beni, massacring more than 700 civilians since October 2014 and perpetrating possible crimes against humanity.
Despite the signing of an agreement regarding DRC's presidential elections on 31 December, the risk of deadly political violence as a result of tensions surrounding the postponed 2016 elections remains high. Security forces have been accused of using excessive force during demonstrations on 19 September and 20 December – the day after President Joseph Kabila's constitutional mandate ended. UNJHRO recorded 48 civilians killed by security forces during the September demonstrations and more than 40 people killed in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Boma and Matadi during December.
As a result of a failure to hold elections during 2016, on 1 September a national dialogue was launched to ensure a peaceful political process. Additional mediation between the government and opposition took place under the aegis of the Conference Episcopale du Congo (CENCO). On 31 December the CENCO negotiations resulted in a deal calling for elections to be held during 2017 and for President Kabila to abstain from seeking a third term. Negotiations on implementation of the deal met several complications, resulting in CENCO withdrawing from further negotiations. As part of the agreement, on 7 April President Kabila appointed Bruno Tshibala as the new Prime Minister, but opposition parties protested with marches in Kinshasa and elsewhere.
ANALYSIS:
Growing government repression and the population's frustration with the unconstitutional delay in elections enhances the risk of political violence. The government must take meaningful steps towards ensuring a timely and peaceful transition of power in the DRC, including implementation of the CENCO agreement.
Competition for control of profitable minerals, as well as underlying conflict between communities that consider themselves indigenous and those perceived as outsiders, has enabled the proliferation of armed groups in the DRC. Such groups will continue to emerge even after the eradication of the ADF and FDLR if these issues are not resolved. Rising tensions in areas that have been relatively calm in recent years, particularly Kasaï, is indicative of the government's inability to address the competing challenges of ending the political crisis and preventing the growth of violent armed groups.
Military measures taken against armed groups continue to leave civilians at risk of reprisal violence. The FARDC has also been implicated in attacks on civilians, including widespread sexual violence. While the government has recently charged several FARDC soldiers with war crimes committed in the Kasai region, it has customarily failed to hold members of the security forces accountable for widespread and systematic human rights violations and has not adequately addressed allegations of disproportionate force during protests.
The government of the DRC has struggled to uphold its Responsibility to Protect and its own forces have been complicit in some previous mass atrocity crimes. The DRC needs ongoing international support to prevent recurring violence.
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE:
On 31 March 2016 the UN Security Council (UNSC) extended MONUSCO's mandate until March 2018, emphasizing that the DRC government "bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against humanity and war crimes." The resolution also reduced MONUSCO's troop ceiling from 19,815 to 16,215 despite the mounting security challenges in the country.
On 12 December the United States announced targeted sanctions against two high-ranking government officials while the European Union imposed sanctions on seven individuals with "command and control" responsibility for security forces involved in deadly violence. The UNSC also currently subjects 9 entities and 31 individuals connected to armed groups in the eastern DRC to sanctions.
OHCHR has called for accountability for the killing of civilians during the September and December protests. On 20 February High Commissioner Zeid called for the immediate halt to widespread human rights violations by the armed forces. High Commissioner Zeid condemned the "blunt military response" that does not tackle the root causes of conflict but "instead targets civilians on the basis of their presumed links to militias."
On 11 February MONUSCO condemned atrocities perpetrated by Kamuina Nsapu and the FARDC's disproportionate use of force, pledging to deploy a mobile monitoring response team to the area to "possibly prevent, investigate, and document human rights violations." The UNSC issued a Press Statement on 24 February calling for an immediate investigation into violence in the Kasaï provinces, noting that the reported violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) may constitute war crimes. The African Union, European Union, MONUSCO and International Organisation for the Francophonie issued a joint statement on 28 March condemning on Kamuina Nsapu's attack on DRC police.
NECESSARY ACTION:
The DRC government and MONUSCO must ensure that protecting civilians remains their primary priority as they address the ongoing threat posed by various armed groups. The FARDC and MONUSCO need to improve their capacity to respond to early warning of inter-communal violence and attacks by armed groups.
The security forces must respect international standards on the use of force. The government must urgently address allegations of the security forces using disproportionate force against protestors and ensure accountability for the unlawful killing of civilians. The FARDC must not permit individuals who have previously committed atrocities to join its forces and should train all recruits in the protection of civilians, respect for human rights and IHL.
Parties to the CENCO political agreement should ensure its swift implementation as a means of avoiding any further deterioration of the political situation.

Title: Illegal Armed Groups Pose ‘Persistent Threat’ to Africa’s Great Lakes Region | HUMAN WRONGS WATCH

12 April 2017 – The United Nations envoy for Africa’s Great Lakes region encouraged today the countries of the region, and the UN Security Council, to help strengthen the fight against illegal armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its neighbours, particularly as elements of the former M23 rebel group have resurfaced.

“The persistent activities of illegal armed groups remain one of the main threats to the security of the population and the stability of the DRC and the region,” said Said Djinnit, the Special Envoy for theGreat Lakes Regiontold the Security Council.

He said there is a need to boost efforts to neutralize these armed groups, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), building on the progress made so far by the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) with the support of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO).
“In this regard, it is important to further strengthen cooperation between these two forces. It is also important, as underlined by Security Council resolution 2348, that the Intervention Brigade, with the support of MONUSCO as a whole, increases its offensive operations against these armed groups,” he underscored.
Djinnit went on to welcome the launch by the DRC, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on 18 February of the Joint Monitoring Mechanism to respond to the growing threat posed by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). “I call on all participating countries to contribute actively to this mechanism and to provide it with the necessary resources to enable it to fulfil its mission effectively,” he said.
Overall, the Special Envoy encouraged the countries of the Great Lakes region “to continue their efforts by taking measures to address the problem of illegal armed groups.”
Regarding the political situation in the DRC, Djinnit called on Congolese political actors to scrupulously implement the 31 December Agreement, in order to create the conditions for the holding of transparent and inclusive elections.
“I urge them to refrain from any action that could lead to violence,” he said, reiterating the readiness of the UN to support the Congolese parties in the implementation of that Agreement.
Reporting some progress on the implementation of the region’s Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, he said that he had also witnessed promising steps towards strengthening economic cooperation.
“I encourage the signatory countries to continue to engage in joint development projects that contribute to further enhancing regional integration and stability,” he stated.

The United Nations envoy for Africa’s Great Lakes region, Said Djinnit has encouraged countries in the region, and the UN Security Council, to help strengthen the fight against illegal armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its neighbours, particularly because elements of the former M23 rebel group have resurfaced in the region.
“The persistent activities of the illegal armed groups remain one of the main threats to the security of the populations and to the stability of the DRC and the region. We should continue to beef up efforts aimed at neutralizing the illegal armed groups, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR),” Djinnit said.
Congo has seen a rise in violence in the country’s restive Kasai region, where a worsening insurgency poses the most serious threat to President Joseph Kabila’s 16-year rule.
Kabila’s failure to step down when his two-term mandate expired in December has further destabilized the loosely governed central African giant. Millions died in regional wars from 1996-2003 and dozens of armed groups still operate.
Last Friday, Kabila named Bruno Tshibala, a former member of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), the largest opposition party, as the new prime minister.
Congolese ambassador to the United Nations, Ignace Gat Mavita defended the president’s pick for prime minister saying that he was picked following consultations with the political opposition and the presidential majority.
“My delegation is of the view that the Council should refrain from becoming involved in the conflict within the coalition. This is a conflict that the Council does not fully understand its context. If you speak in favour of one wing of the coalition, as was done by some of you, then you risk reigniting this conflict,” he said.
Earlier this week, Congo opposition call for mass protests against president’s refusal to step down fell flat, after only a handful of people show up.
The sparse turnout in the capital Kinshasa and other major cities pointed to the opposition’s waning credibility and persistent difficulties convincing Congolese to risk frequently deadly crackdowns by security services.
