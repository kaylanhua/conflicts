Title: Congo: Seis civiles murieron en ataque de rebeldes | La República EC
Kinshasa (EFE).- Seis civiles murieron anoche en un ataque perpetrado por supuestos rebeldes ugandeses delFrente Democrático Aliado (ADF)en la región deKivu Norte, en el este de laRepública Democrática del Congo (RDC), informaron hoy a Efe asociaciones civiles locales.
El incidente se produjo en la zona de la localidad deMaimona, según detalló Gilbert Kambale, presidente de laSociedad Civil de Beni.
Los rebeldes portaban armas blancas y se hicieron con el ganado y otros bienes que portaban las víctimas
«La población de aquí vive de los campos y del ganado», señaló Kambale en conversación telefónica con Efe, en la que reclamó que el Gobierno ponga en marcha «estrategias concretas» para luchar contra la violencia.
En la zona, cuya población sufre constantemente la violencia de los insurgentes ugandeses, ya se han desplegado equipos de las fuerzas de seguridad para tratar de encontrar a los atacantes.
Los locales, sin embargo, reclaman soluciones para el problema y mayor efectividad a los cuerpos locales, que además cuentan con el apoyo de los cascos azules de la misión de lasNaciones Unidasen el país (MONUSCO).
Esta misma semana, también en Kivu Norte, miembros del ADF habían matado ya a 14 agricultores.
El noreste de la RDC lleva años sumido en un largo conflicto alimentado por decenas de grupos rebeldes, a pesar de la presencia del Ejército congoleño y de las fuerzas de la MONUSCO.
El Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados (ACNUR) estima que actualmente hay 5 millones de congoleños desplazados, 675.000 en las naciones vecinas, y 4,3 millones en el interior del país.
Más de medio millar de personas fueron asesinadas solo en Kivu entre junio y noviembre de 2017, y otras mil fueron secuestradas, según datos de Human Rights Watch (HRW).
La región, situada en una zona montañosa de complicado acceso, permite a los rebeldes ocultarse con facilidad y escapar a las operaciones militares sobre el terreno.
El ADF empezó su campaña de violencia en 1996 en el distrito de Kasese, en el oeste de Uganda, tras lo cual se expandió a varias zonas cercanas a la frontera con la RDC.
Esta es una de las organizaciones armadas que siguen actuando en la RDC tras el desarme en noviembre de 2014 del grupo rebeldeM23, que llegó a controlar buena parte de la región.
A todo ello se ha sumado recientemente el impacto de un brote deébolaen la zona, que ya ha causado 11 muertos confirmados en laboratorio. EFE(I)

In the final communiqué, the Heads of State welcomed the agreement signed by the parties to the conflict in South Sudan  last week.

They encouraged President Salva Kirr and Dr. Riek Marchar as well as all those involved in its implementation to enable  the desired peace and national reconciliation by the southern Sudanese people.

Still on the above issue, the participants congratulated the Heads of State and Government of the region for their personal engagement in bringing peace to South Sudan.

Ten men and four women kidnapped by suspected Ugandan rebels were found dead in the Democratic Republic of Congo's restive east, military sources said today.

Title: Kagame slams US sanctions over child soldiers - 24Tanzania.com
KIGALI – Rwandan President Paul Kagame on Friday angrily condemned a US decision to impose sanctions against his country for allegedly backing rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo who recruit child soldiers.Rwandan President Paul KagameKagame said the decision would only play into the hands of other rebels made up of remnants of Hutu extremists who carried out the 1994 Rwandan genocide.“It benefits those enemies of our country who seek to destroy what we are trying to build,” Kagame said in a speech to parliament.The United Nations accuses Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels in neighbouring eastern DR Congo, a charge the country has adamantly denied.On Thursday, Washington said it was invoking the 2008 Child Soldiers Protection Act to end US financial and military assistance to Rwanda.But Kagame said the sanctions “benefit the people that throw grenades here in Kigali and killed our children”, referring to recent attacks in the capital carried out in the run-up to parliamentary elections last month.“They don’t care about our children,” he said, lashing out at “those murderers who live in the DRC (and) in South Africa” — a reference to exiled Hutu extremists linked to the 1994 genocide as well as other opponents.The M23 rebel group was founded by former Tutsi rebels who were incorporated into the Congolese army under a 2009 peace deal but who turned their guns on their former comrades in 2012.Kagame’s government, also dominated by Tutsis, is accused of backing the rebels as part of a proxy war against Hutu rebels in the DRC and to seek influence in the country’s mineral-rich eastern Kivu region.Kagame repeated denials of covert support for the M23, and described the sanctions as an “insult”.“I don’t understand why Rwanda is treated… with such injustice,” he said. “Rwanda is going to be judged and held accountable for the mistakes made by others.”AFP

Kinshasa, Aug 8 (AFP) Ten men and four women kidnapped by suspected Ugandan rebels were found dead in the Democratic Republic of Congo's restive east, military sources said today.
"The 14 people who were abducted were found dead and buried" an army source told AFP.
Three civilian sources also confirmed the discovery and attributed the attack to Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.

Title: Ban urges leaders to consolidate peace in Africa’s Great Lakes region | UN News
FacebookTwitterPrintEmail
Addressing the third summit of heads of State and government of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), taking place in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, Mr. Ban commended in particular the commitment of the leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to promote peace and stability in the region.
In amessagedelivered by his Special Envoy for the region, Olusegun Obasanjo, the Secretary-General welcomed last week’s summit between the Presidents of the two countries, as well as the exchange of their ambassadors.
“This is no doubt a result of the collective efforts of the two countries and the region,” he noted. “It is also an example of how the ICGLR can serve as an effective instrument for change.”
He also highlighted the 23 March agreements between the DRC Government and armed groups in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu, and appealed to all parties to pursue the full implementation of the accords.
In addition, he drew attention to the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, which he described as “one of the most far-reaching agreements that the region has ever seen.”
Under the Pact, which entered into force in June 2008, countries of the region committed themselves to tackling the underlying causes of the many conflicts that have raged there in recent decades and to deal with key security, governance, development, humanitarian and social issues from a regional perspective.
“It is now crucial to move from commitment to implementation,” the Secretary-General said, adding that this requires strong leadership.
At the same time, Mr. Ban said the region still faces “profound” security, humanitarian, developmental and environmental challenges.
“I urge you as members of the ICGLR to make full use of this unique mechanism to quickly consolidate peace. This is, of course, an essential ingredient to sustainable development,” he stated.
The core members of the ICGLR are Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic (CAR), DRC, Kenya, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
In a related development, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known asMONUC, held a meeting last week bringing together dozens of traditional leaders in the country’s troubled east to discuss the joint DRC-Rwanda military operation aiming to root out the notorious ethnic Hutu militia known as the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR).
The leaders from South Kivu province conferred on challenges, including how best to protect civilians, posed by the operation, known as Kimia II, which was launched earlier this year.
Also attending the two-day gathering was South Kivu Governor Louis Mudherwa, who stressed the Government’s commitment to help those forced to flee their homes by the fighting, asking the traditional leaders for their support in the peace process.
Last week, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the latest bout of fighting between DRC troops and the FDLR, along with their local allies, uprooted a further 35,000 people in South Kivu last month, bringing the total displaced there since January to 536,000. More than 1.8 million people are now internally displaced in the DRC’s east.

The reason for the statement of concern is that several simultaneous conditions in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have given rise to a situation where an explosion of new infections is likely, in a densely populated tribal war zone.
Thenew outbreak of Ebolawas identified on August 1, just one week after the previous outbreak of Ebola officially ended on July 24.
Theearlier outbreakhad occurred in far western DRC province of Equateur, centered on a port city on the Congo River. Applying lessons learned from the huge Ebola pandemic of 2014-16 in West Africa, the WHO moved very quickly contain and eliminate that outbreak. WHO medical personnel barely had time to relax when they received word of the new outbreak in the far eastern provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. Both the previous and current outbreaks were caused by the “Zaire strain” of the Ebola virus. However, scientific evidence shows the two outbreaks are unrelated. This means that the virus has again made a jump from the environment (through bats or animals) to people.Daily MailandBBCandAFP
The earlier outbreak occurred in one large city, but mostly in small villages, where doctors could easily and aggressive use “contact tracing” to prevent the virus from spreading. When an Ebola patient is identified, then all that person’s contacts and contacts of contacts are tracked down and are warned to remain indoors for an incubation period of 21 days. A newly developed vaccine can be given to suspected victims to prevent illness.
So far, 63 people are believed to have died in the outbreak that began on August 1. There are about 103 confirmed and probable cases.
The biggest cause for concern is that one of the confirmed cases is that of an unidentified WHO physician who has been identifying and diagnosing Ebola patients. However, he wasn’t infected by one of his patients. He was infected by his wife when she returned from a nearby city.
The doctor had been in contact with over 100 people in the town of Oicha, about 50 km from DRC’s border with Uganda. About 97 of these people have been identified, and WHO officials have been using contact tracing and vaccinations to stop the spread. The problem is that the spreading could go out of control.
North Kivu province is rich in mineral sources, including gold. In August 2007, DRC government forces attacked civilians in order to obtain these mineral sources, creating an enormous refugee crisis, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing into refugee camps in Uganda. In 2017, the number of refugees has been surging, because of tribal violence between DRC government forces and a rebel coalition known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
Currently, the city of Oicha itself is not under ADF control, but the entire region surrounding Oicha is under ADF control, where aid workers, priests, and government officials are being held hostage. North Kivu is the most densely populated province in DRC, so there are many scenarios where the virus could spread explosively — into a region controlled by the AFD, or into a refugee camp in Uganda.
The situation is even further complicated by the fact that the ADF has used violence against US peacekeepers in the region. United Nations officials were stunned in December by the worst attack on United Nations peacekeepers in recent history, when 15 people were killed and 54 wounded in Kivu state, near the border with Rwanda and Uganda.World Health OrganizationandInternational SOS

Title: DR Congo Rolls out Prototype Ebola Drugs as Death Toll Rises to 67 - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency
HOT:» In the Wake of Global Upheaval: Bulgaria's Regression on LGBTQ+ Rights and Ukraine’s Bold Offensive

An outbreak of Ebola in eastern DR Congo has killed 67 people this month, authorities said Saturday, as they roll out a battery of new drugs to tackle the virus amid concerns it has spread to a rebel-encircled area.
A total of 105 cases have been reported since the flare-up of Ebola began on August 1 in Mangina in North Kivu province, according to the health ministry, out of which 77 have been confirmed by laboratory tests.
It said 11 people have recovered from the virus and 67 had died.
Health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga travelled to Mangina on Thursday and saw two patients being discharged after they were treated with a new prototype treatment called mAb114.
"These two people are among the first 10 patients to have received the therapeutic molecule mAb114," the ministry said in a statement.
Developed in the United States, it is the first therapeutic drug to be used in an active Ebola epidemic in the DRC.
Earlier this week, the health ministry said four other experimental drugs had been approved for treating infected patients.
On Friday, the World Health Organization warned that signs the virus had spread to the city of Oicha in North Kivu could frustrate efforts to contain the virus.
While Oicha itself is not under rebel control, WHO emergency response chief Peter Salama said the city was entirely surrounded by territory held by a feared Ugandan insurgent group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
Large numbers of civilians have been killed in unrest around Oicha, while aid workers, priests and government employers are currently being held hostage there by insurgents.
On Friday, army troops came under attack in Beni, at the heart of the Ebola-affected region, military and civil sources said. The assault was blamed on ADF rebels.
No official toll were provided but locals contacted by AFP on Saturday spoke of around 10 soldiers killed.
The current Ebola outbreak is the 10th to strike the DRC since 1976, when the disease was first identified and named after a river in the north of the country.
