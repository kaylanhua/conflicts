Title: Under the UN initiative, leaders of Africa’s Great Lakes region undertake a field visit to assess progress in the neutralization of negative forces in eastern DRC - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 3 more
Nairobi, 11 September 2017 – Under the leadership of the Office of the United Nations Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region, representatives of the signatory countries of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC) Framework agreement, namely from the African Union (AU), the International Conference on the Great Lakes region (ICGLR) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) undertook a field visit in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to assess progress in the neutralization of negative forces in this region. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) provided logistical support for the visit, which also included Uganda.
For decades, illegal armed groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and the M23 have, at different periods of time, caused despair and contributed to the instability and lack of security in eastern DRC. Despite substantial progress in neutralizing these negative forces, eastern DRC remains largely in the hands of these armed groups that continue to perpetuate acts of violence and human rights abuses against civilian populations and are involved in the illicit exploitation of natural resources.
Furthermore, lack of progress in the implementation of the Nairobi Declarations and incursions of ex-M23 elements from Uganda into the DRC late last year and earlier this year remain a cause of concern as they fuel a climate of tension and mistrust between countries in the region. In addition, following renewed fighting in South Sudan in July 2016, hundreds of fighters of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army – In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and thousands of South Sudanese refugees crossed into eastern DRC, where their presence further threatens the country’s stability, thus worsening an already-fragile and unpredictable situation in eastern DRC.
In response to the above challenges, representatives of the ‘Guarantors’ of the PSC Framework, i.e., the UN, the AU, the ICGLR and SADC, have carried out a number of activities aiming to support ongoing efforts for the neutralization of negative forces. These include a series of consultations in Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC in April 2016 and a field visit to eastern DRC in May of the same year to engage stakeholders on ways to remove obstacles in the implementation of the Nairobi Declarations and the repatriation of the ex-M23 still present in Uganda and Rwanda, and to encourage the repatriation to Rwanda of disarmed FDLR elements present in the DRC.
Following the 17th meeting of the Technical Support Committee of the PSC Framework in Kenya on 4 May 2017, the members of the Committee agreed to undertake a second visit to eastern DRC in September this year to assess the situation on the ground and to make recommendations for the heads of state and government of the region. The Technical Support Committee is an advisory mechanism comprising senior government officials from the 13 signatory countries of the PSC Framework. It is expected to make recommendations to advance the implementation of the core objectives of the Framework which include the neutralization of armed groups; tackling the illegal exploitation of natural resources; addressing impunity and promoting judicial cooperation; finding durable solutions for refugees and IDPs; supporting Women and Youth empowerment; and promoting regional integration, economic development and governance.
The objectives of this year’s field visit were to assess progress and challenges in the neutralization of negative forces, as well as in the Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR) of foreign disarmed combatants; to strengthen ongoing initiatives on the neutralization of negative forces; and to accelerate the repatriation of former combatants, including the disarmed FDLR and the SPLM-IO located in eastern DRC, as well as the ex-M23 members that are still present in Rwanda and Uganda.

Title: Kagame and The Congo – MIR
The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs
Rich in resources yet rife with conflict, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is geographicallythe second largest country in Africa. Its neighbour Rwanda is one of the smallest and has a fraction of the population, yet it has played a key role in instigating several conflicts and interfering in Congolese politics for the past 2 decades, spearheaded by Rwanda’s  long serving andrecently re-elected  president Paul Kagame.
Rwanda’s actions have been detrimental to any attempt at peace in the region. Their interference has greatly contributed to the DRC’s currently impoverished and fragile state, as well as wider geopolitical conflict in the Great Lakes region of Africa.
Rwanda’s involvement in the DRC started shortly after the Rwandan genocide. Having fled to the Congo’s Kivu region following the genocide, several Hutu rebel groups remained at large, regrouping to form theDemocratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). Due to the continued threat to Rwanda’s borders, Kagame ordered a fully fledged invasion of the DRC, in an attempt crush the rebel groups, swiftly overthrowing the then dictator of the nation Mobutu. After overthrowing Mobutu,Kagame proceeded to install Laurent Kabila,into the Congolese presidency. Kabila however was not loyal to Kagame’s wishes and double crossed the Rwandans, aiding the FDLR again. In response, Kagame launched another fully fledged invasion of the country in 1998, setting off one of the largest conflicts in modern history. 3 years into the conflict presidentLaurent Kabila was murderedby one of hisownbodyguards. Despite this, the conflict waged on and Kabila was replaced by his son, Joseph Kabila who is still president of the nation today
Fearing Rwanda’sinvolvement in Congo would allow anti-Angolan rebels shelter, in the midst of the unrest, Angola sent in their troops to aid the Congolese government. Motivated by the promise of minerals, Zimbabwe also sent in troops to the DRC’s aid. Meanwhile, Rwanda’s close allies Burundi and Uganda sent in their troops to help Kagame in his invasion. In addition to the several state actors, numerous non-state actors with varying alignments, such as the Hutu militia organization Interahamwe and the Angolan  guerrilla group UNITA, became involved in the conflict. Seeing the chaos unfold, the UN sent its second largest peacekeeping force in history, deploying 20,000 troops to the region. The result was thebloodiest war since World War II,with 5.4 million dead, a humanitarian crisis and a country left in an impoverished and fragile state.
The war ended in a draw; however, Rwanda maintained a military presence in in the DRCuntil 2009.
While Rwanda maintained that its presence in the country was purely for self defence reasons, its continued exploitation of Congo’s natural resource wealth has led many to believe otherwise. The DRC has one of the largest deposits in the world ofColtan, a key mineral in the production of high tech goods, as well as large deposits of gold, diamonds and other valuable minerals. TheUN estimatedthat the Rwandan army made $250 million in the space of eighteen months from the looting of Congolese minerals, in the eastern region of Kivu. Furthermore, during this period of occupation, Rwandan exports in Coltan skyrocketed making it one of the largest Coltan exporters in the world. Rwanda’s ally Uganda was also greatly involved in the looting, with the material goals of their occupation becoming very clear after thetwo supposedly allied forces clashedover diamond mines in Kisangani.
As international scrutiny increased (the UN released a report on the issue in 2002), Rwanda attempted to distance itself from the issue, through the establishment of various militias and the support of various warlords. The most prominent and ruthless of these was the CNDP (Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple), formed by warlord Laurent Nkunda, who is believed to have committed mass atrocities, according to Human Rights Watch and other NGOs that operate in the region.A UN reportexposed this relationship in 2004, greatly condemning Rwanda’s presence in the country. The conflict between the Congolese government and Rwandan-supported Tutsi rebel groups was extremely ruthless with themassacres and mass rapesproving exceedingly common, as the groups battled for control over the Kivu region. Throughout this entire time Rwanda defended its role in the destabilization of its neighbour,with the claim of defendingits borders from Hutu rebel groups found there.
In 2009,a peace deal was finally reachedbetween the CNDP and the Congolese government. Nkunda was arrested by his former supporter, the Rwandan government, and peace finally seemed viable in the long conflict-ridden Kivu region. Threeyears later, however, the peace deal has soured as many of the former Tutsi rebels who had been integrated into the Congolese army took up arms once again against the government managing to take over Goma, the capital city of the North Kivu province.
With UN assistance, the Congolese army defeated the M23, over the course of two years. Once again,allegations of Rwandan supportfor the rebel group surfaced, with a UN report claiming that the Rwandan and Ugandan government provided military aid to the group in their fight against the Congolese state. The M23 in return reportedly smuggled minerals to their neighbours. Following the M23’s defeat in 2013, Rwanda took in scores of former M23 rebels, allowing them asylum in the country. This supposedly included several leaders whom the UN wanted to prosecute for war crimes.
Despite the fact that the Rwandan genocide took place more than 20 years ago, conflict between Hutu and Tutsi continues to exist, and  has largely moved to neighbouring DRC instead. Identity politics between Hutu and Tutsi have been a key part of Kagame’s approach to his neighbour, despite his aversion to any sort of identity discoursein Rwanda. The justification of his involvement in the Congo, for the protection of Tutsi Congolese from Hutu, has often led to hisdemonizing Hutusin his neighbouring country. Recently, anti-Hutu posters and lighters were found circulating throughout Congolese cities, a political move which many think Kagame instituted in order to come across as the “good guy.” However, it is not known who is really responsible and furthermore hard to tell in a region as disconnected from the world as the DRC.
Since its establishment as a single entity under the brutal colonial regime of King Leopold, the DRC has suffered under the continued rule of tyrants and despots who continue to loot the country rather than use its wealth for the people. The Rwandans are just the latest in a long line of looters to profit off of the country’s vast natural wealth. Even though the need to protect Tutsis from Hutu rebels mayhave played a large role, resources were undoubtedly a very strong underlying motive for Rwanda’s involvement in their neighbour’s affairs. Despite numerous attempts at a peace process rebel groups continue to thrive in the Kivu region, as soon as one is defeated another one appears. While Rwanda is not solely responsible for the bloody conflict to their west, they have played a large role at undermining numerous attempts at peace, something which as yet nobody on their side has admitted to.

Title: DRC's Kabila Paints Violence in Kasai as War on Terror
By Margaret Besheer  September 23, 2017
The Democratic Republic of the Congo's president told the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering Saturday that his military was fighting terrorists in the center and east of the country.
The fighting in the central Kasai province has displaced more than 1.4 million people. Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered.
President Joseph Kabila blamed the violence on the Kamuina Nsapu militia, who he said was "sowing terror." He is heard here through an interpreter.
"In Kasai, a mystical religious tribal militia is using the civilian population, including children, as a human shield, and has carried out attacks on persons and buildings symbolizing state authority," Kabila said through an interpreter.
In March, U.N. experts Zaida Catalán, a Swede, and American Michael Sharp were slain while investigating human rights abuses in the province. Kabila said he regretted the barbaric killings and they would not go unpunished.
U.N. investigators have said they cannot preclude the involvement of different actors, including state security services, in the crimes.
In the country's volatile east, Kabila said the army had made progress containing rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
Of the country's presidential elections, which were supposed to take place in December, Kabila said DRC was moving toward them.
"This is an irreversible process, and this all is, and should be, taking place without external dictates or interference," he said.
South Sudan's First Vice President Taban Deng Gai also addressed Saturday's session, making little mention of the continuing conflict and hunger afflicting his nation.
"Realization of peace takes time," he said. "Attaining peace in South Sudan is a process; it requires our collective efforts."
He said refugees and the displaced, of which the country has more than 3 million, were gradually returning to their villages. Nearly 4 million South Sudanese are facing severe hunger, but the vice president only alluded to the need for continued support to achieve a hunger-free country.

Nairobi, 11 September 2017 – Under the leadership of the Office of the United Nations Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region, representatives of the signatory countries of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC) Framework agreement, namely from the African Union (AU), the International Conference on the Great Lakes region (ICGLR) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) undertook a field visit in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to assess progress in the neutralization of negative forces in this region. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) provided logistical support for the visit, which also included Uganda.
