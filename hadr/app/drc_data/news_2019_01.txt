Title: Congo’s FDLR rebels now in peacekeepers’ sights -U.N - 24Tanzania.com
After the success of the Congolese army and U.N. peacekeepers in defeating M23 rebels, the U.N. Security Council agreed on Wednesday that attention should now turn to tackling other armed groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, envoys said.At the top of the list is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some Hutus who fled neighboring Rwanda after the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus, said French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud.Millions of people have died from violence, disease and hunger since the 1990s as dozens of rebel groups have fought for control of eastern Congo’s rich deposits of gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt and uranium.In an unprecedented move, the United Nations deployed earlier this year an Intervention Brigade with a mandate to eliminate armed groups in eastern Congo.The 3,000-strong brigade was an assertive new step for peacekeeping, which for years has been criticized in the region for inaction and failing to protect civilians.“The general consensus was that we have to handle the other armed groups, and among which – I guess on the front line if I may say – the FDLR,” Araud said after a briefing of the 15-member Security Council on the Democratic Republic of Congo.The Tutsi-led M23 rebel group on Tuesday called an end to a 20-month revolt after the army captured its last strongholds. Martin Kobler, head of a nearly 20,000-strong U.N. mission in Congo (MONUSCO), said the focus would now be on the FDLR and Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).“The ADF in many ways are the most scary of the forces because they are the only ones that have an ideology … the ADF is a Muslim extremist force and there’s talk of links to (Somalia’s) al Shabaab,” said a senior council envoy, speaking on condition of anonymity, before Wednesday’s briefing.

Title: DRC seeks UN help against Rwanda rebels on border | News24
Thursday, 29 August
31 Jan 2019
Democratic Republic of Congo's government has asked its UN peacekeeping mission for help against Rwandan rebels planning operations against Rwanda from inside Congolese territory, the UN said on Wednesday.
Leila Zerrougui, chief of the UN mission known as MONUSCO, said Kinshasa asked in a letter for peacekeepers to "thwart" FDLR Hutu rebels who were mustering in an eastern province near Rwanda's border.
The Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) have in the past carried out cross-border attacks on Rwandan forces from rear bases in the DRC.
In his letter DRC Defence Minister Crispin Atama Thabe said rebel brigades had moved from North Kivu into South Kivu province where they would be able to join a rebel commander planning operations in Rwanda.
DRC "cannot accept being used as a rear base for a foreign rebel movement against one of its neighbours," the minister said in the letter, which was shared on social media and with the local press.
The minister did not give details about the kind of help the government wanted UN peacekeepers to provide.
Zerrougui said the UN peacekeeping mission praised Kinshasa's cooperation and had notified the Rwandan authorities.
The DRC's government said on Monday it had extradited two FDLR rebel commanders to Rwanda as part of a legal agreement.
One of the two men extradited was Bazeye Fils La Forge, an FDLR spokesperson.
The FDLR has been fighting in eastern DRC for decades.
The authorities in Rwanda say the group's leaders took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which some 800 000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered by the military and by Hutu militias.

Goma — A Rwandan rebel spokesperson was captured by the army in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), sparking further fighting with the insurgents in which two Congolese soldiers were killed, the military said.
Ignace Nkaka, a member of the DRC-based Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), was seized late on Sunday near the Ugandan border, a regional DRC army official, Djike Kaiko, said by phone. He didn’t say if Nkaka would be immediately repatriated to Rwanda.
The DRC has struggled for two decades to defeat dozens of local and foreign militias in its east, which is home to deposits of tin, gold and coltan. Some of the FDLR’s leaders are linked to the perpetrators of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide in which about 800,000 people were killed.
Rwanda has said as many as three of its soldiers and four FDLR rebels were killed during a December 9 attack that was the insurgents’ first incursion into Rwanda in more than two years.

Title: DRC extradites two rebel Hutu leaders to Rwanda | News24
Thursday, 29 August
29 Jan 2019
The government in the Democratic Republic of Congo said on Monday it had extradited two leaders of the Rwanda Hutu FDLR rebels to Rwanda, as part of a legal agreement.
"These two people were subject to arrest warrants, wanted by the legal authorities in their country," said government spokesperson Lambert Mende.
"We extradited them as part of a judicial co-operation agreement between the DRC and Rwanda," he added.
One of the two men extradited was Bazeye Fils La Forge, spokesman for the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR).
In mid-December, the Congolese authorities confirmed an announcement by the Rwandan authorities that they had arrested the two leaders in DRC.
The FDLR, founded in 2000, has been fighting in eastern DRC for decades.
The authorities in Kigali say the group's leaders took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which some 800 000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered by the military and by Hutu militias.

Title: ACLED Regional Overview – Africa (29 January 2019) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 3 more
Key developments in Africa in the week of January 20th include the multilayered violence in the DRC and CAR, the deadliest attack on UN forces in Mali to date amidst rising JNIM activity in the country and in the region, and the large-scale protests that rocked Tunisia.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR) were among the most active countries in Africa last week.
In the DRC, fighting surged in the Masisi territory (Nord-Kivu province). Militias fought for territorial control between January 19-26th, leaving at least 35 killed. The clashes involved members of the Renewal faction of the Nduma Defence of Congo (NDC-R), the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo (APCLS) as well as factions of the Mayi Mayi Nyatura. Meanwhile, the government announced key gains against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in operations in Faringa in Rutshuru and Rubaya in Masisi over January 9th-23rd; as well as against the National Council for Renewal and Democracy (CNRD) – a splinter faction of the FDLR – on January 18th in Masisi. This was the first reported event involving the CNRD since September 2018. Further north, around Beni, the Congolese and international forces remain key targets. On January 21st, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) attacked the FARDC in Mapou (Oicha) and on the 23rd, the Union of Patriots for the Liberation of Congo (UPLC) abducted three MONUSCO soldiers in Kisalala (Butembo). Over the summer of 2018, the UPLC had been reportedly operating alongside the ADF and Mayi Mayi factions in this area.
In CAR, violence rose ahead of a gathering of the leaders of 14 armed factions to negotiate a new peace agreement in Khartoum, Sudan. As forces of the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC) – one of the most active of these armed factions – lost grounds in Bakouma (Mbomou prefecture) against the military and MINUSCA forces on January 16th, they launched new attacks in Bambari (Ouaka). On January 19th, after killing a humanitarian worker and a teacher in the town, they clashed with the MINUSCA forces. Four days later, they targeted the MINUSCA forces with a rocket, leading to clashes that left another three civilians dead. Not far from Bambari, in Ippy, a drunken UPC soldier also opened fire on civilians at a funeral, killing 13 civilians. His commander executed him the next day. Meanwhile, forces of the Return, Reclamation and Rehabilitation (3R) killed 13 people in Zaoro Sangou (Mambere-Kadei) on January 20th. These developments underline key challenges in the new bid to forge peace in the CAR. In hosting the talks four months after successful negotiations to resolve the conflict in South Sudan, Khartoum is asserting itself as a strategic conflict resolution actor in the region. Yet, the talks are held at a tumultuous time for Sudan. Anti-government protests have entered their sixth week last week and continue to be heavily repressed by the security forces: two new fatalities reported on January 24th brought the total fatalities in riots and protests since December 16th to nearly 40.
One other key development last week in Africa was the complex attack against the MINUSMA forces on January 20th in Mali’s Aguelhok (Kidal region). The complex attack, initiated by a suicide car bomb and followed by an armed assault, was claimed by militants of the Group for Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM), who condemned the normalisation of relations between Chad and Israel – reminiscent of the language used by Al Shabaab gunmen in the attack in Kenya’s Nairobi the week prior. JNIM’s attack left 10 peacekeepers killed and 25 wounded, as well as three assailants killed. This was the deadliest attack ever recorded against the UN contingent. A few days later, IEDs likely laid by JNIM combatants struck two MINUSMA convoys in the Douentza area (Mopti), leaving another two peacekeepers killed and seven others injured. The events reflect a significant increase in the JNIM activity in Mali and in bordering Burkina Faso and Niger over recent months. In Mali, events involving the group went from four in September 2018 to 26 in December 2018, prompting new combined air and ground operations by joint Malian and French forces at the beginning of January 2019.
Noteworthy last week in Africa were lastly the large-scale protests that rocked Tunisia after the breakdown of talks between the government and the country’s general labour union (UGTT) over salary increases in the public sector. Preparatory and secondary school teachers, who have been protesting since December for wage increase and educational reforms, announced an open-ended strike after the breakdown on January 17th, pushing thousands of students into the streets nationwide. At least 80 riots protests have been reported across the country between January 18-26th, mostly led by students, students’ parents and teachers, with the security forces intervening in only a handful of cases. The demonstrations reflect a growing social malaise in Tunisia amidst hardening economic conditions.

Title: Rwanda National Congress (RNC) denies once again the links with FDLR - Therwandan
IHURIRO NYARWANDA – RWANDA NATIONAL CONGRESS STATEMENT,
PRESS STATEMENT, January 28, 2019
Rwanda National Congress (RNC) denies once again the allegations that we have links with FDLR and that we are planning to attack Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
In a letter addressed to the Representative of Monusco, The DRC Minister for Defense sought support of Monusco to intercept FDLR forces moving from North Kivu to South Kivu to join forces with General Kayumba in order to attack Rwanda.
RNC would like to say that, first of all, we have no links with the said FDLR or any armed group the minister is referring to. Secondly, neither RNC nor General Kayumba has any intention to attack Rwanda.
RNC believes that this continuing smear campaign originates from Kigali’s government in attempt to justify its narrative that RNC is a terrorist organization. We also believe that, by tirelessly continuing this narrative, Kigali is hoping that may be, some international organizations will buy the Kigali version of account, therefore distracting the International Community from our request to negotiate with Kigali regarding fundamental issues facing our nation, Rwanda. It is unfortunate that, the Government of Congo (DRC) through its minister of defense fell into this trap. The timing of the statement, however, did not surprise us given the visit by a high Congolese delegation to Kigali right before the inauguration of a new Congo president.
RNC is a nonviolent organization that seeks political change in Rwanda through dialogue and other peaceful means.
RNC will not be intimidated in any ways in our campaign to advocate for Rwandan people’s right, and we ask support of all Rwandans and the international community to mobilize and condemn the oppressive and totalitarian regime led by President Kagame.

Title: Rwanda yatolea kauli ripoti ya Umoja wa Mataifa – DW – 04.01.2019
Ripoti ya wataalamu wa Umoja wa Mataifa ilibainisha kuwa makundi yenye silaha yanayopambana dhidi ya serikali ya Rwanda yanapata msaada kutoka Burundi na Uganda. Sasa serikali ya Rwanda imesema haitavumilia uchokozi huo.
Siku moja baada ya ripoti ya wataalamu wa Umoja wa Mataifa kubainisha kuwa makundi yenye silaha yanayopambana dhidi ya serikali ya Rwanda yanapata msaada kutoka Burundi na Uganda, serikali ya Rwanda imesema haitavumilia uchokozi huo. Bila kuzitaja nchi za Burundi na Uganda zenye sintofahamu na nchi hiyo, Rwanda inasema inalifuatilia tatizo hilo kwa namna ya kipekee.
Waziri wa Mambo ya Nje wa Rwanda, Dkt. Richard Sezibera, ambaye pia ndiye pia msemaji wa nchi, amesema kwamba kundi lenye silaha la FDLR linaloshutumiwa kuhusika katika mauaji ya Rwanda ya mwaka 1994 likiendesha harakati zake mashariki mwa Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Kongo, DRC, na lile la RNC la Kayumba Nyamwasa aliyewahi kuwa mkuu wa majeshi ya Rwanda akiwa sasa uhamishoni nchini Afrika Kusini yanapata misaada ya hali na mali kutoka nchi mbili za kanda ya Maziwa Makuu.
Makundi ya FDLR na RNC yanapata silaha kutoka Uganda na Burundi- UN
Ripoti ya watalaamu wa Umoja wa Mataifa kuhusu makundi yenye silaha mashariki mwa DRC imesema kwamba makundi hayo mawili yanapata misaada kutoka Burundi na Uganda. Waziri wa Mambo ya Nje, Dk. Richard Sezibera, anasema hilo lina ushahidi usiopingika:
"Rwanda haitoi malalamiko, Rwanda inatoa ushahidi kuhusu usumbufu wa haya makundi, huu ni ushahidi wa majina,mahali walipo, ushahidi wa silaha zinazotumiwa, sisi kama serikali tuna ushahidi huo na tumeshautoa kwa mataifa yanayounga mkono makundi hayo na pia tumeshautoa kwa jumuiya ya mataifa. Hii ni ripoti ya watalaam wa Umoja wa Mataifa na sisi tunatarajia ripoti hii itatolewa kwa Baraza la Usalama la Umoja wa Mataifa na tunahisi baraza hilo litachukua mikakati kuhusu ripoti hiyo."
Rais Kagame: "Baadhi ya matatizo yetu husababishwa na mataifa jirani"
Hii pia imejiri siku chache baada ya Rais Paul Kagame kutangaza msimamo wake juu ya tatizo hilo, alipokuwa akihutubia taifa kwenye Mkesha wa Mwaka Mpya: "Uhusiano wetu na mataifa mengine ya kiafrika uko vizuri lakini kuna matatizo yanayosababishwa na baadhi ya mataifa jirani zetu.
Baadhi ya majirani zetu hao wanaendelea na vitendo vinavyonuia kufufua makundi yenye silaha kama vile FDLR na RNC yenye lengo la kuhatarisha usalama wetu. Vitendo hivi hudhoofisha mikakati ya maendeleo ambayo kwa kawaida imekuwa ikiendelea vizuri katika nchi zetu za jumuiya ya Afrika mashariki. Haya yapo ijapokuwa mataifa hayo yanakanusha ukweli huo."
Rwanda imesema kwamba licha ya kuendelea kulizungumzia suala hilo na majirani zake, haitazuia kuweka mikakati mikali kulinda mipaka yake. Hii pia inajiri huku kukiendelea visa vya chini kwa chini vya watu wenye silaha hasa kwenye mpaka wa Rwanda na Burundi.

Title: A Congo War Crimes Decision: What It Means for Universal Jurisdiction Litigation in Germany and Beyond
byCristian González CabreraandPatrick Kroker
January 11, 2019
Democratic Republic of the Congo,Germany,International Law,Law of Armed Conflict,Universal Jurisdiction,War Crimes
byCristian González CabreraandPatrick Kroker
January 11, 2019
The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, BGH) in Karlsruhe recentlyannouncedin a press release its much-anticipated decision in a Congo War Crimes case. The BGH, Germany’s court of last resort in all matters of criminal and private law, partly overturned a 13-year prison sentence imposed on Ignace Murwanashyaka by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht, OLG) in 2015. Murwanashyaka was the president of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda, FDLR), a Hutu rebel group active in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2000 that has committed heinous crimes against civilians in its quest to topple the current government in Kigali, Rwanda.
The lower OLG had found Murwanashyaka, as well as his vice-president, Straton Musoni, both of whom reside in and conducted activities from southern Germany, guilty of leadership of a terrorist group pursuant to §§129aand129bof the German Criminal Code. The OLG had also found Murwanashyaka guilty of aiding four war crimes committed by the FDLR; these charges proceeded under the GermanCode of Crimes against International Law(Völkerstrafgesetzbuch, VStGB), a criminal statute that prohibits international crimes and allows for prosecutions on the basis of universal jurisdiction. Since both defendants had been in custody since 2009, Musoni has already served his 8-year sentence, while Murwanashyaka remains in detention. Upon review of the OLG’s decision, the higher BGH diverged from the lower court’s opinion on Dec. 20, 2018, and affirmed that the FDLR did not just commit war crimes, but also crimes against humanity. Nevertheless, with respect to the specific defendants’ liability, it upheld the convictions based on leadership of a terrorist group, but overturned Murwanashyaka’s conviction for complicity in war crimes. In doing so, the Court delivered a blow to VStGB international crimes litigation in Germany.
Background
The FDLR case was the first VStGB case ever heard by Germany’s highest court. Germany adopted the VStGB in 2002 pursuant to its obligations under theRome Statute of the International Criminal Courtin order to make international crimes justiciable at the domestic level. Not a single trial took place under the new law during its first five years, leading some critics to label it “a law without application.” Though §1of the statute allows for “pure” universal jurisdiction, which is to say prosecutions of crimes with no tangible link to Germany, universal jurisdiction complaints that were filed, including by human rights groups, were not investigated or were ultimately dismissed. This is due to the wide discretion that the Federal Prosecutor enjoys when it comes to extraterritorial VStGB cases (cf. the prosecutor’s discretion in non-extraterritorial cases, §153fof the German Code of Criminal Procedure).
This inaction began to change in 2008 with the creation of a war crimes unit within the Federal Prosecutor’s Office and the subsequent investigations into the FDLR’s leadership and a former Rwandan mayor residing in Germany. With the punishable acts having been committed in southern Germany, the Federal Prosecutor was obliged to initiate investigations according to the official principle (Offizialprinzip, §152of the German Code of Criminal Procedure), which obliges the Prosecutor “to take action in relation to all prosecutable criminal offences, provided there are sufficient factual indications.” It was these factors that led to the trial against Murwanashyaka and Musoni before the OLG Stuttgart, which lasted from May 2011 until September 2015.
The War Crimes Counts
In vacating Murwanashyaka’s conviction under the VStGB, the BGH determined that prosecutors had not adequately proven that the defendant aided and abetted war crimes. In 2015, the lower OLG court had found that Murwanashyaka was knowingly complicit in the FDLR’s raiding and pillaging of four villages, which resulted in the deaths of at least 181 people. Specifically, the OLG held that he physically facilitated the war crimes by providing satellite and mobile phones, and that he encouraged the troops to commit the crimes by producing propaganda that knowingly disclaimed, trivialized, and denied the perpetration of war crimes.
The BGH found that the OLG’s findings concerning the link between the supporting acts by the defendant and the actual crimes were insufficient to carry a conviction for aiding and abetting. Specifically, the BGH found that it was unable to appreciate the extent to which Murwanashyaka’s supportive acts in Germany, e.g. his provision of satellite and mobile phones, furthered the specific war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by FDLR troops on the ground in the DRC. In this regard, the Court characterized some of the lower court’s findings as “unclear” and “not without inconsistencies,” an exceptionally blunt expression of criticism for a German court. Though the BGH largely upheld the findings of fact on FDLR’s crimes and structure, and even diverged from the lower court in finding that the FDLR committed crimes against humanity, the BGH vacated the findings of fact on the role of the accused in these crimes and structures and the pertinent legal reasoning.
It remains to be seen if the BGH’s full written judgment, which will be released in early 2019, will opine on the requirements to establish complicity in international crimes in more detail. Also outstanding is whether the trial court will convict Murwanashyaka for aiding and abetting in a rehearing that will likely include new evidence. Notably, the Federal Prosecutor had also appealed the trial court’s decision, arguing for a conviction on the basis of Murwanashyaka’s command responsibility per §4of the VStGB. The BGH ruled that Murwanashyaka lacked the necessary “effective control” over the troops in the DRC in order to apply the § 4 provision.
The question of command responsibility is now on the table again with the prospect of new evidence. It is difficult to imagine how the prosecutor can secure a conviction on the basis of command responsibility, however, given the BGH’s ruling on aiding and abetting. Though the BGH FDLR decision was admittedly the product of a cumbersome and lengthy process, the Court’s overturning of Murwanashyaka’s war crimes conviction was overall a disappointment for advocates of international criminal law in Germany.
Other Impediments in the Case
While this aiding and abetting issue is the most recent troublesome development in the FDLR proceedings, ithas not been the only one plaguingthis unique international crimes case. For example, despite the prevalence of wartime gender-based violence in the region (see the work ofthe 2018 Nobel Laureate Denis Mukwege), the Court dropped all FDLR sexual violence charges over the course of the proceedings due to corroboration issues. Specifically, the Court expressed doubts as to whether the evidence gathered, which was mainly anonymous victim testimony, was sufficient to buttress a conviction. This raises the question of whether a more meticulous investigation might have led to a court judgment on instances of sexual violence.
Moreover, even though under German criminal procedure law, victims of certain crimes can join the proceedings as a “private accessory prosecutor” (Nebenklage) and gain participatory rights in the trial, no victim availed him- or herself of this mechanism in the case. While victims’ security and pecuniary concerns might have impacted the use of the mechanism, it is also unclear whether German officials informed victims of their full rights, including to legal representation, during the pre-trial investigation. Furthermore, though universal jurisdiction prioritizes deterrence and redress, German authorities failed to develop a robust communication strategy toward victim communities that would bolster these goals. In fact, the Stuttgart court’s press office published updates exclusively in German, suggesting that authorities did not prioritize a victim-centered approach.
The Use of Universal Jurisdiction in Other Situations
As much as the FDLR case was a learning experience for the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office, it is to be hoped that the case’s shortcomings do not reverberate beyond the FDLR proceedings. Germany continues to pursue cases underuniversal jurisdiction in the Syrian context, particularly through “structural investigations” devoted to Syria and Iraq, i.e. broad investigations, without specific suspects, aimed at gathering evidence available in Germany to facilitate future criminal proceedings before German or other courts. There are currently 80 ongoing investigations with specific suspects, about half of them concerning Syria and Iraq. The Prosecutorhas also secured war crimes convictionsagainst Syrian non-state actors on the basis on the VStGB.
Armed with the VStGB, a modern code of international crimes, and, since October 2018, a second war crimes unit within Federal Criminal Police, Germany is playing a leading role in the investigation and adjudication of international crimes. Indeed, German civil society, including theEuropean Center for Constitutional and Human Rights(ECCHR), is pushing for the German Federal Prosecutor to continue pursuing other mass atrocity cases characterized by state impunity. Such appeals have been particularly successful in the context of the Syrian War, where various criminal complaints lodged by ECCHR on behalf of Syrian victims have yielded an internationalarrest warrant for Jamil Hassan, head of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Services and perpetrator of,inter alia, torture, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
It is also to be hoped that the lessons from this first trial under the VStGB are appreciated beyond the borders of Germany. Indeed, like German authorities, prosecutors in other European countries have begun to look into allegations of international crimes in Syria pursuant to universal jurisdiction and other related statutes. In November 2018, a French judgeissued arrest warrantsagainst Ali Mamlouk, head of Syria’s National Security Bureau, and Jamil Hassan for their roles in torture, enforced disappearances, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Austrian authoritieshave also initiatedinvestigations into the Syrian Intelligence Services’ role in systematic torture following a criminal complaint submitted by 16 Syrian women and men to the Public Prosecutor in Vienna in May 2018. Probes against Syrian non-state actors have, too, led to investigations, charges, and, in some cases, convictions in places such asSweden,Norway,the Netherlands,Switzerland, andFinland.
The FDLR decision, while only binding in Germany, may have persuasive influence in these and future international crime proceedings, whether with respect to modes of liability or otherwise. Indeed, it is one very important piece of the international justice movement crystallizing in Europe and beyond.
Looking Forward
The FDLR case represents an important step by German authorities in recognizing a lesson from Nuremberg: when it comes to international crimes, national borders are secondary to impunity. The very fact that a trial took place is remarkable given that international crimes proceedings were unfathomable in most national jurisdictions even just 20 years ago. The BGH even vindicated the role of international criminal law by diverging from the lower court’s opinion and affirming that the FDLR did indeed commit crimes against humanity, not just war crimes.
Despite these successes, the BGH’s decision highlights that the FDLR proceedings leave much to be desired. Whether in the Court’s treatment of modes of liability or sexual violence, or in German authorities’ questionable victim interaction, there is room for improvement. The proceedings also served as a reminder of the inherent difficulties in transnational litigation, particularly as it relates to the collection of evidence overseas and the mutual legal assistance of territorial states (in this case Rwanda and the DRC), both of which were costly, bureaucratic, and time-consuming.
As international crimes proceedings become more commonplace in Germany and Europe, including on the basis of universal jurisdiction, international justice advocates are hoping that the FDLR proceedings will serve a positive role in the creation of good practices. With the rehearing of Murwanashyaka’s war crimes conviction before the lower court in Stuttgart coming up, it will be seen whether the Court pays heed. After 4 ½ years and 320 trial days for the OLG’s decision of first instance, it is the least the Court can do now for those who have and may continue to suffer as collateral damage of the Congolese Civil War.

Title: Uganda on high alert as neighboring DR Congo goes to the polls--China Economic Net
As the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is scheduled to hold general elections on Sunday, neighboring Uganda is on high alert at the military, health and refugee fronts.
Richard Karemire, Uganda's military spokesperson, told Xinhua by telephone on Saturday that the army has beefed up security at its western common border with volatile eastern DRC.
"We continue to be prepared in case on any incursions on our territory by the Allied Democratic Forces rebels (ADF).That one has always been steady and has become a permanent phenomenon on our part to keep on maximum alert," Karemire said.
Karemire added that the ADF could use the high numbers of fleeing Congolese to infiltrate the border.
ADF is a Ugandan rebel group holed up in the jungles of eastern DRC together with other Congolese militia groups.
Karemire said military has sufficient forces along the border. "We are supported by Local Defense Units. We recruited thousands of them sometime back," Karemire said.
REFUGEE FRONT
The UN refugee agency in a recent interview with Xinhua said in case there is an overflow of Congolese seeking refuge in Uganda, humanitarian agencies are ready to handle them.
There are fears that there is likely to be post-election violence after the Sunday vote.
Duniya Aslam Khan, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Uganda, said additional resources may be required in case there is an influx of refugees.
According to the inter-agency Refugee Response plan for 2019-2020, about 416 million U.S. dollars is needed for 2019 to respond to the humanitarian needs of the Congolese refugees in Uganda.
According to UNHCR figures, about 300,000 Congolese refugees are expected to be hosted in Uganda by the end of 2018. Many of them flee fighting in north and south Kivu regions.
HEALTH FRONT
Parts of eastern DRC are experiencing an Ebola outbreak, according the World Health Organization (WHO).
Facing the challenge, Uganda says it is tightening border surveillance just in case there is an influx of people crossing as a result of possible election violence.
"We are putting in place measures to ensure that we have the capacity to screen whatever numbers may flock into the country," Ruth Aceng, Uganda's minister of health told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO Country Representative, told Xinhua that efforts have been doubled ahead of the polls to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease into the country.
"There has been an effort by the ministry and its partners to prevent the spread of the disease. The volunteer health teams have been briefed and are intensifying surveillance," said Woldemariam.
"Even if people pass and they get sick, the community is the second line of defense and that capacity has been enhanced in the last few weeks," he said.

4. State of military forces
The Armed Forces of the DRC (Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo, FARDC) were formed after the Second Congo War and the installation of a transitional government in 2003. The FARDC was designed to unify government forces and elements from all the main armed groups in the DRC. Approximately 18 integrated brigades have been established while a Rapid Reaction Force of 12 battalions is being established, but the process has proven to be problematic.
The DRC’s military suffers from corruption, which impacts heavily on soldiers’ pay, with some receiving no salary at all from time to time. Troops are also inadequately equipped, supported and housed and in general the army is ill-disciplined and underfunded, resulting in soldiers preying on the local population when deployed.
There are widespread reports of human rights abuses and criminal activities carried out by FARDC troops (including integrated ex-rebels), notably rape and extortion. The FARDC is known to be involved in commercial mining businesses, mineral trafficking and other illicit activities.
Much of the equipment in the FARDC’s inventory is old, obsolete and unserviceable – its air force and navy have almost no functioning assets. However, a significant amount of military hardware was acquired from Ukraine in 2009/2010, including T-72 main battle tanks and small arms and ammunition.
The FARDC is unable to adequately deal with the numerous security challenges the country faces, most notably the M23 rebel movement, which briefly held the eastern city of Goma in November 2012 after the army retreated. As a result, there is ongoing instability in the east of the DRC.
The DRC is home to the United Nation’s largest peacekeeping mission, with 17 000 peacekeepers deployed. The UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has been mandated to use all necessary means to carry out its protection mission, which includes the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders under imminent threat of physical violence, as well as the protection of United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment. In spite of UN backing, and training by foreign militaries such as the United States and South Africa, the FARDC remains a largely ineffective force. Consequently, MONUSCO in March 2013 approved the deployment of a 3 000 strong intervention brigade in the DRC with a mandate to conduct targeted offensive operations against eastern DRC rebels.5.

Title: Kagame Again Accuses ‘Two Neighbors’ of Backing Negative Forces Against Rwanda - SoftPower News
Rwanda's President, Paul Kagame.
Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, has again while delivering his New Year’s message, accused two countries neighbouring Rwanda of supporting armed insurgents whose intention is to destabilize his country.
He said that the two neighbors have tried to revive the danger posed by FDLR, RNC, and other negative forces.
The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) is an armed rebel group active in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo while Rwanda National Congress (RNC) is a Rwandan opposition group in exile which was founded Gen Kayumba Nyamwasa, Dr. Theogene Rudasingwa, Gerald Gahima, and Patrick Karegeya.
President Kagame said that in the year 2018, Africa became more united and that Rwanda contributed to that process. He also noted the achievements registered in growing Rwanda’s economy which he said reinforced the unity and solidarity of Rwandans.
Kagame said in his message that 2018 saw Rwanda’s relationship with “our African brothers” grow stronger but was quick to add that challenges remain in the East African Community (EAC) regional block.
“Our relationship with our African brothers is stronger today. But there are still challenges in our region. Some neighbours have tried to revive the danger posed by FDLR, RNC, and other negative forces,” he said.
This, he said, jeopardises the otherwise good progress in East African integration, as well as regional security.
“For one neighbour, we expect it. However, we are surprised by another neighbour, where the evidence we have, and which they must also have, shows clear complicity, despite public denials,” Kagame said, hesitant to disclose which neighbours he was making reference to.
He said that the matter is being handled, and that “we continue talking with our neighbours in the spirit of African solidarity”.
This was the second time in one month, Kagame was accusing neighboring countries of backing elements considered as hostile by Rwanda.
In December 2018, two people were killed after unknown raiders struck a district in Rwanda’s southern province bordering Burundi.
Rwanda’s military issued a statement saying the attackers in Cyitabi Sector of Nyamagabe District also set on fire three passenger buses and injured eight other people.
While addressing a news conference in December, President Kagame said that some neighbors and beyond were working with FDLR and RNC and that they posed a security threat.
“There are those in the region and across the world who have been linked with our history, much as perpetrators were Rwandans. We have had invasions from neighbouring countries. Those challenges have been changing forms but they remained in substance as security threat,” he said.
“FDLR is working with RNC and some of our neighbours. There are many other groups with different names. We will take care of that,” he added.
Like the attack in December, Rwanda’s biggest security threat has previously been from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where armed groups that Kigali accuses of having been involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, are based.
The year 2018 saw sour relations between Rwanda and Uganda. The relations had been strained by counter accusations between Kigali and Kampala administrations, and culminated into countless publications by the two countries’ media carrying stinging accusations.
Kigali in a protest note to Kampala in December 2017, had accused Uganda of facilitating rebel elements tied to the diaspora based opposition group, RNC and arresting Rwanda nationals. This was preceded by Uganda’s arrest and deportation of Rwandan nationals following a number of murders in Uganda.
Uganda explained that the arrested and deported Rwandans were involved in espionage and crime perpetrated with the aid of some elements in Uganda Police Force who have since been charged by the General Court Martial. Kampala also accused Rwanda of committing kidnappings and illegal repatriation of Rwandan refugees living in Uganda.
When Presidents Yoweri Museveni and Kagame met in Entebbe in March last year, they blamed the friction in bilateral relations to unverified intelligence by security agencies in both countries.
Museveni said they had discussed the need for close cooperation within security intelligences so they can get enough facts, a point that was emphasized by Kagame.
In his New Year’s address, President Kagame asked the people of Rwanda to remain vigilant, while not allowing themselves to be distracted.

Title: DR Congo seeks UN help against Rwanda rebels on border | The Citizen

Kinshasa wants UN peacekeepers, seen here, to help “thwart” Rwandan rebels in its territory said to be planning operations against Rwanda. AFP/JOHN WESSELS
Leila Zerrougui, chief of the UN mission known as MONUSCO, said Kinshasa asked in a letter for peacekeepers to “thwart” FDLR Hutu rebels who were mustering in an eastern province near Rwanda’s border.
The Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) have in the past carried out cross-border attacks on Rwandan forces from rear bases in the DR Congo.
In his letter DR Congo Defence Minister Crispin Atama Thabe said rebel brigades had moved from North Kivu into South Kivu province where they would be able to join a rebel commander planning operations in Rwanda.
DR Congo “cannot accept being used as a rear base for a foreign rebel movement against one of its neighbours,” the minister said in the letter, which was shared on social media and with the local press.
The minister did not give details about the kind of help the government wanted UN peacekeepers to provide.

Zerrougui said the UN peacekeeping mission praised Kinshasa’s cooperation and had notified the Rwandan authorities.
The DR Congo’s government said Monday it had extradited two FDLR rebel commanders to Rwanda as part of a legal agreement.
One of the two men extradited was Bazeye Fils La Forge, an FDLR spokesman.
The FDLR has been fighting in eastern DR Congo for decades.
The authorities in Rwanda say the group’s leaders took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which some 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered by the military and by Hutu militias.

The Armed Forces of the DRC (Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo, FARDC) were formed after the Second Congo War and the installation of a transitional government in 2003. The FARDC was designed to unify government forces and elements from all the main armed groups in the DRC. Approximately 18 integrated brigades have been established while a Rapid Reaction Force of 12 battalions is being established, but the process has proven to be problematic.
The DRC’s military suffers from corruption, which impacts heavily on soldiers’ pay, with some receiving no salary at all from time to time. Troops are also inadequately equipped, supported and housed and in general the army is ill-disciplined and underfunded, resulting in soldiers preying on the local population when deployed.
There are widespread reports of human rights abuses and criminal activities carried out by FARDC troops (including integrated ex-rebels), notably rape and extortion. The FARDC is known to be involved in commercial mining businesses, mineral trafficking and other illicit activities.
Much of the equipment in the FARDC’s inventory is old, obsolete and unserviceable – its air force and navy have almost no functioning assets. However, a significant amount of military hardware was acquired from Ukraine in 2009/2010, including T-72 main battle tanks and small arms and ammunition.
The FARDC is unable to adequately deal with the numerous security challenges the country faces, most notably the M23 rebel movement, which briefly held the eastern city of Goma in November 2012 after the army retreated. As a result, there is ongoing instability in the east of the DRC.
The DRC is home to the United Nation’s largest peacekeeping mission, with 17 000 peacekeepers deployed. The UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has been mandated to use all necessary means to carry out its protection mission, which includes the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders under imminent threat of physical violence, as well as the protection of United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment.

Title: New Alaska Attorney General Kevin Clarkson has been tied to anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom for decades | Media Matters for America
Research/StudyResearch/Study
Clarkson was co-counsel on an ADF case up until he was nominated for attorney general
SpecialProgramsLGBTQ
Written byKayla Gogarty
Published01/22/19 12:04 PM EST
Update (9/3/19):Since the publication of this article, Clarkson has joined anamicus briefin support of severalTitle VII Supreme Court cases, including an ADF case, which argue that employers should be able to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Alaska laws protectless than halfof the state’s LGBTQ population from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in “private employment, housing, and public accommodations,” and Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s recent appointment of Attorney General Kevin Clarkson puts LGBTQ Alaskans at even greater risk. Clarkson has a long history of advocating against LGBTQ rights and nondiscrimination policies in Alaska, and he has spent more than two decades working alongside extreme anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).
DunleavyappointedClarkson as the state’s new attorney general on December 5. Clarkson was previously asenior attorneyfor the law firm Brena, Bell & Clarkson, and heworkeddirectly alongside ADF in a case representing a women’s homeless shelter in Anchorage, AK, thatis suingto be exempt from the city’s LGBTQ-inclusive nondiscrimination policy after it refused to house a homeless transgender woman. Clarksonwithdrewfrom the case on December 6 after being appointed the state’s attorney general.
ADF is one of thelargest and most powerfulanti-LGBTQ groups in the nation and hasplayed a rolein over 50 Supreme Court decisions, including on cases regarding abortion, religion, tuition tax credits, and LGBTQ issues. The legal powerhouse has taken dozens of extreme anti-LGBTQ positions, such assupportingRussia’s so-called “gay propaganda” law,defendingthediscredited and dangerouspractice of conversion therapy,advocatingagainst adoption and foster care by LGBTQ people, andsupportingpolicies that ban trans people from using facilities that align with their gender identity.
ADF hasidentifiedClarkson as an allied attorney, and his history with the extreme anti-LGBTQ organization spans more than 20 years. ADF hasalumni and alliesin influential government positions across the country, including in other state attorneys general offices. It is crucial for reporters to include this context when discussing the Anchorage shelter case, or reporting on any other LGBTQ-related matters Clarkson might be involved in as attorney general.
ADF isrepresentingthe Hope Center, also known as the Downtown Soup Kitchen, in its ongoing case,The Downtown Soup Kitchen d/b/a Downtown Hope Center v. Municipality of Anchorage. ADFsuedthe city of Anchorage in August “to stop it from applying a gender identity law to the Hope Center shelter, which denied entry to a transgender woman” in 2018. The city’s trans-inclusive policy wasput to a votein April, but Anchorage voters upheld the protections and “soundly rejected” the ballot measure that sought to repeal them.
Clarkson served as the Hope Center's localcounsel,alongsideADF, from the start of the case in early 2018 until he withdrew onDecember 6, the day after he was appointed attorney general. The Hope Center’s case washeardby the U.S. District Court on January 11, and ADF is alsopushingseveral other license-to-discriminate cases through the courts.
In 1997, ClarksonattendedADF’s National Litigation Academy (now known asADF Academy), a program thattrained“attorneys to battle the radical homosexual legal agenda, defend parental rights, uphold the sanctity of human life, and protect religious freedom.” ADF hasdescribedthe program as “all-expense-paid classes” in exchange for lawyers providing “450 dedicated pro bono hours on matters related to ADF issues.” ADF hasidentifiedClarkson as one of itsmore than 3,300allied attorneys, who mustagreeto a "statement of faith" which claims that “homosexual behavior … and acting upon any disagreement with one’s biological sex” are “sinful and offensive to God.”
Clarkson has also served as local counsel alongside or with the help of ADF on several other cases in Alaska since 1999. In addition to his role in theHope Center case, Clarkson has served as co-counsel with ADF on a casedefendinga law that required abortion providers to notify the parents of minors; receivedtraining and fundingfrom ADF for a 1998 case regarding a ballot measure attempting “to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman”; receivedfunding and legal supportfrom ADF in a 2005 case regarding benefits for government employees in same-sex relationships; andrepresentedtwo churches in a 2008 case about a “property tax exemption for religious schools.”
In fact, Clarkson has provided ADF withmore than 10,000 hoursof pro bono or dedicated service, which ADF calls “the equivalent of nearly five years of legal assistance, offered at no cost to clients.” Clarkson’s extensive work on behalf of the extreme anti-LGBTQ grouphas earnedhim ADF’s “Silent Watch” and “Gold Service” awards.
Many state attorneys general havegained powerin the last decade as they used litigation to shape policymaking, whichThe Washington Posthas noted “raises concerns because much of it occurs well outside of the public view.” Alaska’s attorney general hasbroad powersto advise the governor and represent the state in legal matters, “including the furnishing of written legal opinions to the governor, the legislature, and all state officers and departments.” In 2017, former independent Gov.Bill Walkerused one suchlegal opinionfrom then-Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth to establish his administration’s position on tribal recognition and sovereignty, demonstrating how attorneys general can provide a “legal framework” for state governments to act.
As attorney general, Clarkson can also support and defend anti-LGBTQ bills. Attorneys general in other states, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, have previously weighed in on LGBTQ issues. Paxton hassupportedTexas’ anti-LGBTQ “bathroom bill,”sued-- alongside 10 other states -- the Obama administration over its guidelines protecting trans students, andfiledlegal briefs in support of the Trump-Pence administration’s discriminatory position against trans-inclusive bathroom policies. Another reportedADF allied attorneywho became a state’s attorney general, Montana’sTimothy Fox, also has ahistoryof using his office tofightagainst LGBTQ rights.
With Clarkson’s appointment to Alaska attorney general, ADF has only expanded its influence over policymaking and the broader fight against LGBTQ equality.

Title: 
Rwandan president concerned about threat to E. African integration, regional security - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KIGALI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Some external forces are trying to jeopardize the good progress in East African integration and regional security, which is cause for concern, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said Monday in his end-of-year message on state-run Rwanda TV.
He was referring to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a rebel group based in Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), and the Rwanda National Congress (RNC), an opposition group in exile that aims to topple the government.
Last December, Kagame said that the FDLR was working with the RNC and some of Rwanda's neighbors after suspected rebels assaulted western Rwanda, which sparked a fire exchange between the attackers and the government army.

Title: Democratic Republic of Congo seeks United Nations help against Rwanda rebels on border
Kinshasa:DR Congo's government has asked its UN peacekeeping mission for help against Rwandan rebels planning operations against Rwanda from inside Congolese territory, the UN said on Wednesday.

Title: DRC Elections And The Fate Of The UN MONUSCO Mission – Analysis – Eurasia Review
A Journal of Analysis and News

Location of DR Congo. Source: CIA World Factbook.
ByGeopolitical Monitor
By Wilder Alejandro Sanchez*
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) held long-awaited general elections on30 December to replace President Joseph Kabila,
who has ruled the country for almost two decades. The results were
controversial: opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi was declared the
winner, but another candidate, Martin Fayulu, has cried foul, stating
that he is the rightful winner and that Tshisekedi’s victory is a result
of a pact between him and Kabila. At the time of this writingthe Constitutional Court has reportedly confirmedTshisekedi’s victory.
While this new political crisis hits the African nation, one question
that should be asked: What will be the future of the UN mission to the
DRC, theUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo (MONUSCO)?
The population of the DRC and the international community in general
have waited for fair presidential elections in the African nation for a
long time, not to mention a peaceful transfer of power. President Kabila
took control of the country when his father,President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in2001.
The young Kabila would then rule until today, presiding over a
transitional government when the Second Congo War ended, and winning
elections in2006and2011, which were marked by controversy. The country was supposed to hold new elections in2016and Kabila was constitutionally barred from running again, but the
polls were ultimately postponed, as Kinshasa argued that ongoing
violence in the East, alack of funds to organize the elections,
and insufficient time to update the voter registry prevented the
government from holding them. Elections were then supposed to occur on
23 December 2018, only to be postponed once again, and they finally took
place on 30 December.
According to election officials, “Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the
vote, compared with 34.7% for Mr Fayulu. Ruling coalition candidate
Emmanuel Shadary took 23.8%,”the BBC explains.
“Fayulu has alleged that Tshisekedi’s win was the result of a backroom
deal between Tshisekedi and Kabila that allows Kabila to maintain
control over important ministries and the security services,”Al Jazeera reports.
There is widespread concern about the elections and the future of the country, with entities like theSouthernAfrican Development Communityand other international organizations either requesting a recount orcalling for calmin the African nation. The African Union has requested Kinshasa to
suspend the announcement of final election results, which the DRC
government has denied,insistingthat the Constitutional Court’s assessment of the
vote’s legality is impartial. It remains to be seen whether the
international community will recognize Tshisekedi’s apparent victory –
analysts that follow African affairs should monitor which heads of state
and diplomatic delegations attend his swearing-in ceremony, which is
“scheduled for Tuesday, January 22, according to the latest calendar of
the National Independent Electoral Commission (Céni),”AfricaNews reports.
It is in this scenario that MONUSCO continues to operate in the DRC. The UN Security Council, viaResolution 2409 (2018),
extended MONUSCO’s mandate until 31 March of 2019, with a ceiling of
“16,215 military personnel, 660 military observers and staff officers,
391 police personnel, and 1,050 personnel of formed police units,”
including an Intervention Brigade. According to data provided byUN Peacekeeping,
as of 31 December 2018, MONUSCO has 15,366 UN contingent troops; 1,364
UN police officers; and 263 staff officers, making it the largest UN
peacekeeping operation in the world. As for the mission’s mandate,
Article 31 of Resolution 2409 explains that MONUSCO’s priorities are 1)
protecting civilians; and 2) supporting the implementation of the 31
December 2016 agreement to hold elections.
The critical question that must be addressed is: What is MONUSCO’s
future? Should it commence a withdrawal from the country or continue
operating there?
There is no consensus on MONUSCO’s future among experts as the
situation in the DRC is so complex. On the one hand, the country did
hold elections, which fulfills one of the mandate’s objectives; however,
the polls were controversial to say the least, andviolencehas already occurred as the population takes to the streets. Scott
Morgan, a long-time analyst of African affairs, argued to me that “the
uncertainty of the presidential polls could lead to violence regardless
of which candidate is declared the winner. Having the mission remain to
monitor the situation is crucial at this time.”  Moreover, violence in
the Eastern part of the country continues, and the “situation in Burundi
is not expected to show any improvement in the near future. The
repatriation of FDLR fighters to Rwanda is another issue that needs to
be addressed.” To make things even worse, as if that were possible,
there is a newEbolaoutbreak to deal with, and there have been over 600 reported cases and 368 deaths as of early January.
UN peacekeepers could be a key player in handling these challenges,
particularly as the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) “either lack the
capacity or the will to address these issues,” Morgan concludes, not to
mention that the national police and the FARDC are guilty of plenty of
crimes themselves. “Women and children are often kidnapped, frequently
for the purpose of sexual exploitation, with rapes and gang rapes
committed both by armed groups and sometimes by the army,” aUN report explains.
Alas, the mission’s own record so far is hardly ideal, considering widespread evidence of peacekeepers involvementin sexual abuse,human rightsviolations,corruption, or failing to protect Congolese civilians even though they are mandated to do so.
In a co-authored article entitled “Yes, MONUSCO Needs To Stay in the DRC,” published by theInternational Policy Digestin May 2017, Scott Morgan and I argued that, in spite of MONUSCO’smany,manyshortcomings and flaws, it should stay in the DRC. Moreover, the
mission’s troops should receive clearer mandates and orders about
supporting and protecting Congolese civilians from violence and abuse.
When I asked an African expert whether MONUSCO should stay in the DRC,
the blunt reply I received was: “to do what? They do not protect
civilians right now, so why should they stay?” The expert also argued
that MONUSCO’s mandate needs to be more forcefully implemented by the
blue helmets in the ground.
Other experts have argued that it is time for MONUSCO to leave, but
in an orderly, well-planned, and structured fashion. This may have to
occur anyways, as, given its size, MONUSCO is an expensive operation and
theUnited States, among many other countries,
are not paying their dues to the UN. One possibility is that the
mission can be transformed into a political mission or a police one –
akin to the UN mission in Haiti,MINUSTAH, which becameMINUJUSTH.
Finally, it is important to mention that a key factor that will
influence the future of MONUSCO is the attitude of the new president
toward implementing rule of law, transparency and security in the
country. Relations between MONUSCO and Kabila were often tense, so we
will similarly have to monitor the new government’s attitude toward the
UN mission.
To be fair, MONUSCO has attempted to improve the situation in the DRC. For example in May 2018, the UN mission inaugurated “several projects in support of victimsof sexual exploitation and abuse” in the North Kivu area. On 17
January, a vocational training center project for ex-combatants and
young people at risk was launched,which was funded by the UN mission. Additionally, “MONUSCO has provided support to theEbolaresponse since the beginning of the outbreak through the provision of
logistical support, office facilities, transportation, communication,
and security,” theWorld Health Organization explains.
Even more, MONUSCO personnel have lost their lives trying to make the
African nation a better place. According to UN data, the mission has
suffered 167 fatalities; in one incident this past November 2018,six Malawian and one Tanzanian peacekeepers,
in addition to several FARDC troops, were killed in Beni territory,
North Kivu, while carrying out joint operations against a rebel movement
called Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
It goes without saying that the UN Security Council will renew
MONUSCO’s mandate for another year, however what is debatable is whether
the UNSC will order a downsizing of the mission as a sign that it is
time for MONUSCO to leave. Tragically, the country continues to face
several challenges, including political instability. Thus, the weeks
ahead will provide an idea of whether the DRC can have a peaceful
transition of power and what this means for the future of the UN mission
in the African nation.

The difficulty is the UN forces operating in the DRC have about as much motivation and capacity to operate as they do in their own countries, which is pretty much not at all. Africa is a region generally, and the DRC specifically, that requires great talent to execute the mission and these players do not have that. I am a firm supporter of the mission, but these troops need to actually get out into the field and engage. If they were you would see far more results.
The loss of life by these forces in engaging the ADF is problematic and demonstrates the lack of professional execution. You cannot just go rumbling up to their doorstep and expect to be effective. There is far too much concern for the “blue helmet” show of force and not enough stealth to implement any real “force” and therein lies the problem.

KIGALI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Some external forces are trying to jeopardize the good progress in East African integration and regional security, which is cause for concern, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said Monday in his end-of-year message on state-run Rwanda TV.
He was referring to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a rebel group based in Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), and the Rwanda National Congress (RNC), an opposition group in exile that aims to topple the government.
Last December, Kagame said that the FDLR was working with the RNC and some of Rwanda's neighbors after suspected rebels assaulted western Rwanda, which sparked a fire exchange between the attackers and the government army. Enditem

Le Gouvernement du Rwanda et celui de la République démocratique du Congo, RDC, ont initié des pourparlers sur l’extradition au Rwanda des leaders du FDLR dernièrement arrrêtés et mis dans les mains de l’Armée de la RDC.
LaForge Fils Bazeye, de son vrai nom Col Nkaka, porte-parole du FDLR, et le Lt Col Abega, Chef du Service de Renseignements de ce groupe composé essentiellement des présumés coupables du génocide perpetré contre les Tutsis, ont été saisis et incarcérés par l’Armée de la RDC, vers la fin de l’année passée.
Ils ont été saisis à la frontière de Bunagana, le 15 octobre 2018, en provenance de Kampala où ils avaient participé aux entretiens visant à destabiliser la sécurité du Rwanda.
Dès leur saisie, le Rwanda a manifesté le souhait de leur extradition dans leur pays d’origine. Le Secrétaire d’Etat au Ministère des Affaires étrangères, Amb Nduhungirehe Olivier, a dit à IGIHE que les modalités d’extradition sont en étude.
“Les prisonniers sont à Kinshassa. Les pourparlers ont commencé”, a-t-il dit.
Seulement ces pourparlers n’ont pas atteint un niveau avancé, la RDC étant concentrée sur cette période des élections. Vers la fin de l’année qui vient de s’écouler, des informations indiquaient que la RDC pourrait demander, en échange de l’extradition de Bazeye et Abega, celle préalable de Laurent Nkunda et des ex. combattants du M23.
Un des hauts Officiers de l’Armée de la RDC a déclaré à JeuneAfrique que son Gouvernement n’est pas prêt à extrader ces gens n’importe comment.
"Il se pourrait qu’y soit introduit le dossier de Laurent Nkunda, ex. dirigeant du CNDP, actuellement au Rwanda, et celui des ex. combattants du M23, dont la RDC a toujours demandé l’extradition pour qu’ils répondent de leurs présumés crimes commis dans la province du Nord-Kivu”, a dit cet Officier.

Title: DR Congo seeks UN help against Rwanda rebels on border | Daily Mail Online
ByAfp
Published:13:15 EDT, 30 January 2019|Updated:13:15 EDT, 30 January 2019


Kinshasa wants UN peacekeepers, seen here, to help "thwart" Rwandan rebels in its territory said to be planning operations against Rwanda
DR Congo's government has asked its UN peacekeeping mission for help against Rwandan rebels planning operations against Rwanda from inside Congolese territory, the UN said on Wednesday.
Leila Zerrougui, chief of the UN mission known as MONUSCO, said Kinshasa asked in a letter for peacekeepers to "thwart" FDLR Hutu rebels who were mustering in an eastern province near Rwanda's border.
The Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) have in the past carried out cross-border attacks on Rwandan forces from rear bases in the DR Congo.
In his letter DR Congo Defence Minister Crispin Atama Thabe said rebel brigades had moved from North Kivu into South Kivu province where they would be able to join a rebel commander planning operations in Rwanda.
DR Congo "cannot accept being used as a rear base for a foreign rebel movement against one of its neighbours," the minister said in the letter, which was shared on social media and with the local press.
The minister did not give details about the kind of help the government wanted UN peacekeepers to provide.
Democratic Republic of Congo
Zerrougui said the UN peacekeeping mission praised Kinshasa's cooperation and had notified the Rwandan authorities.
The DR Congo's government said Monday it had extradited two FDLR rebel commanders to Rwanda as part of a legal agreement.
One of the two men extradited was Bazeye Fils La Forge, an FDLR spokesman.
The FDLR has been fighting in eastern DR Congo for decades.
The authorities in Rwanda say the group's leaders took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which some 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered by the military and by Hutu militias.

Sarah-Jayne is a Major in the Australian Army and has served with distinction since 2000.
She works in the health area and has had active deployments in Bougainville and East Timor.
She was sent to Aceh to provide medical aid after the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami.
She has facilitated training courses and run health clinics at Army bases.
But in the United States military, Sarah-Jayne would not be allowed to serve. She is transgender, having transitioned in 2012.
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) also used to discharge any member who intended to transition.
In 2010, Army Captain Bridget Clinch challenged her discharge with the Australian Human Rights Commission. The ADF reversed her discharge and repealed its transgender ban.
Since then, trans and gender diverse personnel have slowly come out across the Navy, Army and Air Force.
Australia is now in the company of at least 18 nations that permit open transgender service, including close allies New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada.
In 2016, President Obama began the process of lifting America's transgender military ban. But in mid-2017, President Trump announced that the ban would continue. Activists immediately challenged this in the US courts.
This week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling said the ban will remain in place while the cases work their way through the courts.

If America looked to Australia's recent history, it would see the many contributions that transgender service members bring to the nation's defence.
Those whom I've interviewed for a project on the LGBTI history of the ADF have served as infantry officers, ground defence officers, photographers, band members, in logistics, in personnel and maintaining aircraft weapons systems. They have served in East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan and across Australia.
Since lifting the ban, the ADF has gradually adopted policies to support transgender members. A series of handbooks designed with transgender members provide guidance to commanding officers and to transgender personnel themselves. They address topics such as uniforms, toilet access, pronoun usage and strategies for how to come out.
Like in the United States, social conservatives in Australia have been vocal in their opposition to transgender service. They draw on similar arguments as Trump, but evidence debunks their claims.

Between November 2012 and July 2017, the ADF funded gender dysphoria treatment for 32 ADF members, including surgery for 17 of them.
The $1.16 million bill is miniscule — 0.006 per cent of Defence health expenditure.
The money spent on training and the work that each ADF member performs far outweigh these costs.
This is the same argument used to oppose lesbian, gay and bisexual service before November 1992.
Transgender personnel have reported varying levels of peer support, with officers and trans men tending to have better experiences than trans women and other ranks.
One theme that permeates interviews with transgender personnel is that strong leadership can support all members of a unit.
Australia is now in the company of at least 18 nations that permit open transgender service.(ABC Radio Sydney: Luke Wong)
In June 2018, the World Health Organisation removed being transgender from its list of mental illnesses.
Gender dysphoria is one of many health conditions that serving ADF members may have.
The ADF provides health care to all its members, and since April 2015 a specific policy has outlined treatment processes for members with gender dysphoria and those undergoing transition.
The inclusion agenda is not social engineering. Welcoming transgender members and ensuring that they are treated with dignity and respect does not take away from the respect afforded to other members.
Perhaps the biggest lesson to take from the ADF's shift towards transgender inclusion is that transgender members are not problems or burdens.
As all five Defence chiefs wrote in a 2016 letter to The Australian:
"Diversity is not about identity politics, it is about improving the quality of the workplace. It's the antidote to group think — gaining a wider range of perspectives to make better decisions and, in the military context, enhancing our capability, that often intangible concept that is manifest in the conduct of military operations."
