Omar Aboud, chef de Bureau de la MONUSCO Beni
Depuis le mois de juillet, il s’observe une reprise des attaques contre les populations civiles et des positions des FARDC par les ADF dans la région de Beni, au Nord-Kivu. Omar Aboud, chef de Bureau de la Monusco-Beni, parle de la réponse que la Monusco va apporter pour mettre fin à ces attaques. Interview avec Sekombi Katondolo :
Sekombi Katondolo : A Beni les populations sont excédées à cause des attaques répétées dont elles sont victimes. D’où différentes manifestations de colère. Quel est le message que vous souhaitez faire passer à ces populations ? Quelle réponse la Monusco va apporter pour mettre fin à ces attaques ?
Oumar Aboud: D’abord je voudrais dire que nous sommes solidaires des populations qui vivent une situation intenable en raison de l’insécurité et de l’épidémie à virus Ebola. Depuis juillet, l’on enregistre presque chaque jour de nouvelles attaques avec son lot de malheurs ; et sincèrement, nous déplorons ces nouvelles victimes, ce qui est tout à fait inacceptable. Les populations de Beni, comme du reste de la RDC, ont le droit de vivre en paix et de pouvoir vaquer à leurs occupations sans peur, ni contraintes. Et c’est la raison pour laquelle nous comprenons la frustration de la population et faisons tout ce qui est en notre pouvoir pour les aider sur tous les fronts ; celui d’Ebola, avec le déploiement d’importants moyens pour accompagner les équipes de riposte à l’épidémie sur le terrain, mais aussi, pour protéger les populations civiles en collaboration avec les FARDC et la PNC. Une fois encore, nous comprenons la réaction de la population et nous ne la blâmons pas pour les reproches qu’elle nous adresse, même si certains ne sont absolument pas justifiés. Nous le savons, nous devons faire toujours plus pour mettre fin à cette situation qui déstabilise toute cette partie Est de la RDC.
Que répondez-vous à ceux qui pensent que la FIB (Force d’intervention) ne fait rien alors que, pour le cas du M23, la Monusco a mis tous les moyens pour en finir avec ce mouvement armé ?
D’abord, on ne peut pas comparer le mouvement rebelle de l’époque, le M23, aux ADF. Le M23 était une force organisée qui faisait une guerre classique avec les FARDC et avec la FIB quand elle s’est engagée dans la bataille. Ce n’est pas le cas des ADF qui font la guérilla ou guerre asymétrique, comme on le dit souvent. Ensuite, on l’oublie souvent, en plus de la pression militaire, d’autres démarches, diplomatiques, politiques et autres ont été aussi organisées, que ce soit au niveau régional ou international pour faire plier le M23.
Mais je voudrais dire aussi, en parlant de cette guerre asymétrique, que les opérations de maintien de la paix, pas seulement ici au Congo ; mais aussi dans certaines parties du monde, notamment en Afghanistan, en Syrie ou autre, font face à de nouvelles situations auxquelles nous devons répondre en nous adaptant et en travaillant différemment sur le terrain, et aussi en amont avec les pays contributeurs de troupes. Nous y travaillons depuis plusieurs mois déjà ici, en RDC. Certes, nous comprenons l’impatience des populations, mais de nouvelles stratégies sont en train d’être mises en place pour faire face à la situation. Des patrouilles seront renforcées dans les zones à risque pour continuer de dominer le terrain et protéger les civils. Des bases opérationnelles seront aussi installées là où cela est nécessaire pour continuer de renforcer la protection des civils. Vous savez, Il y a quelques jours, le Représentant spécial adjoint en charge de la protection et des opérations, M. Francois Grignon, s’était déplacé ici, à Beni. Il y est resté pendant trois jours où il a rencontré les autorités locales, les responsables des FARDC, notamment le général Mbangu, le commandant des opérations SUKOLA 1 ; mais aussi les populations, à travers la société civile, les femmes, les jeunes ; aussi bien à Beni qu’a Mayi-Moya, où il s’y était rendu. Et il a été clair concernant la reprise des opérations militaires. Il a dit qu’il faut que ces opérations reprennent au plus vite, ajoutant qu’il y a de la volonté pour ce faire, tant au niveau des autorités nationales que de notre côté. Donc, c’est cela notre objectif actuellement.
Avez-vous un message particulier pour les populations de Beni ?
Que les populations sachent que beaucoup de choses se font, peut-être pas au rythme où elles veulent voir se faire les choses, mais elles se font. Certes, les gens voient seulement l’aspect militaire des choses. Mais, les sections civiles font aussi un travail énorme dans le cadre de la protection. Il y a des mécanismes d’alerte qui sont mises en place à travers les comités de liaison de protection. Et pour cela, nous avons besoin de la contribution des populations en termes d’information et de renseignements. La guerre ne peut pas se gagner sans renseignements. Que ce soient nos forces ou les FADRC, elles ont besoin de cela. Donc, ce que je peux dire, c’est qu’il faut toute une conjugaison d’efforts des uns et des autres pour venir à bout de cette insécurité dans le territoire de Beni.

Title: UN chief visits DR Congo's restive Ebola-hit east | Pulse Nigeria
UN chief Antonio Guterres arrived Saturday in the troubled east of DR Congo, expressing "solidarity" with a region ravaged by violence and an Ebola epidemic.
The secretary general started his three-day tour of Africa's largest country in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, which is trying to roll back a major epidemic of Ebola that has claimed more than 2,000 lives since August last year.
He was received by Leila Zerrougui, his special representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The two did not shake hands in line with protocols aimed at curbing the spread of the highly infectious and potentially fatal disease.
Guterres said he had come to express his support "with the armed forces of DRC in the fight against terrorism" which represents "a threat not only for the Congo but the whole of Africa."
The UN peacekeeping mission in the country known by its French acronym MONUSCO comprises some 16,000 troops and has an annual budget of over $1 billion.
A total of 130 militias and armed groups roam the North and South Kivu provinces of DRC, a vast country the size of western continental Europe.
Guterres is due to visit a centre for demobilised former militia fighters in Goma.
According to the Group of Experts on Congo from New York University and Human Rights Watch, armed groups killed 1,900 civilians and kidnapped more than 3,300 people between June 2017 and June 2019 in the region.
The demobilisation of militias is a priority for MONUSCO, which has been present in DRC since 1999.
On Sunday, Guterres will visit Beni, one of the epicentres of the latest Ebola epidemic, about 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma.
DR Congo health officials said late Thursday that there have been "2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)" since August 2018, adding that 902 people had been cured.
It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016.
Containment efforts have been hindered by conflict in eastern DRC as well as attacks on health workers tackling Ebola within affected communities.
Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018.
"The secretary-general will visit an Ebola treatment centre and meet survivors and health workers," a spokeswoman said.
Apart from Ebola, Beni has been reeling under attacks since October 2014 with civilians and farmers bearing the brunt of the violence.
Most of the killings have been attributed to the Islamist-rooted Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 and has been accused of butchering hundreds of civilians.
"We are entirely by the side of the Congolese authorities in the fight against ADF," Guterres said in Goma.
ADF fighters have also targeted UN troops, killing 15 people in an attack in December.
Under the terms of its latest mandate spanning April to December this year, the UN has closed bases in DRC, reviewed intervention strategy and cut civilian staff by 764 since the beginning of July.
But in Beni, prominent locals called for the UN to beef up the capacity of its rapid intervention force.
"We want more military means to be put at their disposal to finish the ADF in Beni," mayor Bwanakawa Masumbuko said.
Guterres will end his tour in the DRC capital Kinshasa, where he will meet with President Felix Tshisekedi, who recently unveiled a new coalition government after a delay of nearly eight months.

Title: UN chief expresses solidarity with Ebola-hit DR Congo - Digital Journal
Hi, what are you looking for?

UN chief Antonio Guterres started a three-day tour of the Democratic Republic of Congo Saturday, expressing "solidarity" with a region ravaged by violence and an Ebola epidemic.
The UN secretary general first visited Goma, the capital of North Kivu province which is trying to roll back an epidemic of Ebola that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in a year.
Guterres was received by Leila Zerrougui, his special representative in DR Congo.
The two did not shake hands, in line with health protocols aimed at curbing the spread of the highly infectious and very often fatal disease.

The UN peacekeeping mission in the country known by its French acronym MONUSCO comprises some 16,000 troops and has an annual budget of over $1 billion.
A total of 130 militias and armed groups roam the North and South Kivu provinces of DR Congo, a vast country the size of western continental Europe.
At a centre for demobilised former militia fighters in Goma, Guterres appealed to the militias to choose peace.
"It's always possible to choose peace," he said, urging all combatants to come "to a centre like this (for) a new life in peace in their home community."
He added he had heard moving testimony from people living in the bush under the illusion that by being in an armed group they could have a better life. The reality, he insisted, was that meant "a tragic life, a life without a future."
According to the Group of Experts on Congo from New York University and Human Rights Watch, armed groups killed 1,900 civilians and kidnapped more than 3,300 people in the region between June 2017 and June 2019.

Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018, visiting a treatment centre and meeting survivors and health workers.
As the battle against Ebola continues, former health minister Oly Ilunga, who stepped down after criticising plans by the UN's World Health Organization to introduce a second, unlicensed vaccine to the country, has been banned from leaving the country pending a probe into improper use of public funds, according to migration service documents seen by AFP on Saturday.
Ilunga has been questioned as part of an inquiry into the misuse of Ebola funds. Shortly before he stepped down, the minister was replaced by President Felix Tshisekedi as the head of the country's Ebola response team.

Apart from Ebola, Beni has been reeling under militia attacks since October 2014 with civilians and farmers bearing the brunt of the violence.
Most of the killings have been attributed to the Islamist-rooted Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 and has been accused of butchering hundreds of civilians.
"We are entirely by the side of the Congolese authorities in the fight against ADF," Guterres said in Goma.
The country's armed forces Saturday put at 1,662 the number of soldiers killed since 2014 fighting the ADF in and around Beni.
ADF fighters have also targeted UN troops, killing 15 people in an attack in December.

DR Congo health officials said late Thursday that there have been "2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)" since August 2018, adding that 902 people had been cured.
It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016.
Containment efforts have been hindered by conflict in eastern DRC as well as attacks on health workers tackling Ebola within affected communities. Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018.
- Militia attacks -
"The secretary-general will visit an Ebola treatment centre and meet survivors and health workers," a spokeswoman said. Apart from Ebola, Beni has been reeling under attacks since October 2014 with civilians and farmers bearing the brunt of the violence.
Most of the killings have been attributed to the Islamist-rooted Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 and has been accused of butchering hundreds of civilians.
"We are entirely by the side of the Congolese authorities in the fight against ADF," Guterres said in Goma. ADF fighters have also targeted UN troops, killing 15 people in an attack in December.
Under the terms of its latest mandate spanning April to December this year, the UN has closed bases in DRC, reviewed intervention strategy and cut civilian staff by 764 since the beginning of July.
But in Beni, prominent locals called for the UN to beef up the capacity of its rapid intervention force. "We want more military means to be put at their disposal to finish the ADF in Beni," mayor Bwanakawa Masumbuko said.
Guterres will end his tour in the DRC capital Kinshasa, where he will meet with President Felix Tshisekedi, who recently unveiled a new coalition government after a delay of nearly eight months.

Title:  Le GEC souligne les activités des groupes armés au Kivu  – DW – 15/08/2019
Selon le décompte effectué par le GEC, il existe plus de 130 groupes armés dans les provinces du Nord et Sud-Kivu. Le GEC, met l'accent sur les activités des groupes armés dans les deux Kivu et le territoire de Beni.
To play this audio please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 audio
Le rapport précise également que les forces armées congolaises et la Monusco ont subi plus d'attaques des Mai Mai Mazembe et Nduma Défense entre juin 2017 et juin 2019.
L'épicentre des violences se situe dans le Kivu et le territoire de Beni. Rien que pour la région de Beni, la rébellion des Forces démocratiques alliées, un groupe d'origine ougandaise, a tué au moins 272 civils entre 2017 et juin 2019.
Il est également question de la présence de groupes armés en provenance du Rwanda et du Burundi qui continuent à être actifs dans la région.
Jason Stearn, le directeur du Groupe d'étude sur le Congo explique : "S'il y a une possible escalade du conflit à l'est du Congo, cela proviendra de l'extérieur. Il est vrai qu'il y a 130 groupes armés à l'est du Congo mais les groupes les plus importants sont toujours des groupes étrangers, l'ADF ougandais, les différents groupes rebelles burundais qui se trouvent dans le Sud-Kivu, et puis les FDLR et les CNRD qui sont des rebellions rwandaises et restent les groupes les plus importants."


Des groupes importants qui opèrent notamment dans les hauts plateaux des territoires de Fizi et Uvira à la pointe sud du Sud Kivu, selon le rapport du GEC.
Oscar Dunia habite à Uvira et revient sur la situation sécuritaire dans cette partie de la République démocratique du Congo. "Dans les moyens et hauts plateaux, précisément dans le territoire de Fizi, on observe un calme relatif mais il y aura toujours des rebondissements. Il y a toujours la présence des groupes armés et ce sont des signes qui montrent qu'il y a la guerre. Dans la zone, il y a effectivement la présence de groupes armés. On en a en provenance du Rwanda et du Burundi. L'armée est complètement débordée par la situation. Ceux qui mènent les combats sont essentiellement des jeunes et ils mènent leurs combats à des endroits où l'armée n'est pas en mesure de se déployer,"souligne Oscar.
De son côté, l'armée congolaise cherche à rassurer et son porte-parole du secteur opérationel Sukola 2 au sud Sud-Kivu, Dieudonné Kaseraka, affirme que la situation est sous contrôle. "Pour le moment, nous avons déjà réussi à maitriser ces groupes armés, ils ont été mis hors d'état de nuire. Nous avons toujours demandé à la population de se désolidariser de ces groupes car la plupart de leurs membres sont des enfants. Alors nous avons demandé à la population de s'en désolidariser et continuer à soutenir l'armée régulière qui défend l'intégrité du territoire national, conformément à la constitution du pays," rassure Mr. Kasereka.
En attendant qu'une stratégie efficace soit mise en œuvre pour mettre fin à ce cycle de violence, la liste du nouveau gouvernement à Kinshasa devrait être publiée dans les jours prochains. Le rétablissement de la sécurité à l'est du pays sera un enjeu prioritaire pour la nouvelle équipe.

Les opérations Sokola 1 visent à combattre les groupes armés opérant dans l’Est de la province du Nord-Kivu. Le général-major Mbangu Mashita Marcel quitte la tête de ces opérations pour laisser le bâton de commandement au général de brigade Nduru Ichaligonza.
Cet officier supérieur des Fardc vient de Goma, où il était commandant des opérations sokola 2, visant la traque des rebelles des forces démocratiques pour la libération du Rwanda (FDLR), actifs dans le petit Nord-Kivu. Il sera secondé par le général de brigade Chirimwami Nkuba. Le général-major Mbangu Marcel avait pris le commandement des opérations Sokola 1 en 2015, en remplacement du général Muhindo Akili Mundos.
Après une période 4 ans, au cours de laquelle la ville de Beni a enregistré plusieurs cas de massacres, de nombreuses voix commençaient à s’éllever pour demander le remplacement du commandement. C'est le cas des acteurs politiques, des députés provinciaux et nationaux élus de Beni, des structures de la société civile et de différents groupes de pression. Plusieurs défis sont encore à relever dans ces opérations notamment à Beni, où les rebelles présumés ADF continuent à tuer et à enlever des civils ainsi qu’à piller leurs biens dans plusieurs villages et localités, où de nombreux habitants ont déjà abandonnés leurs maisons craignant la mort.

Title: UN chief expresses solidarity with Ebola-hit DRC | Jordan Times
Today,August 29, 2024

ByAFP- Aug 31,2019 - Last updated at Aug 31,2019
United Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres (left) is welcomed by North-Kivu region's Governor Carly Nzanzu as he arrives at Goma Airport on Saturday to visit the Ebola-ravaged North-Kivu region (AFP photo)
GOMA, DRC — UN chief Antonio Guterres started a three-day tour of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Saturday, expressing "solidarity" with a region ravaged by violence and an Ebola epidemic.
The secretary general first visited Goma, the capital of North Kivu province which is trying to roll back an epidemic of Ebola that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in a year.
Guterres was received by Leila Zerrougui, his special representative in the DRC.
The two did not shake hands, in line with protocols aimed at curbing the spread of the highly infectious and potentially fatal disease.
Guterres said he had come to express his support "with the armed forces of [the] DRC in the fight against terrorism" which represents "a threat not only for the Congo but the whole of Africa".
The UN peacekeeping mission in the country known by its French acronym MONUSCO comprises some 16,000 troops and has an annual budget of over $1 billion.
A total of 130 militias and armed groups roam the North and South Kivu provinces of the DRC, a vast country the size of western continental Europe.
Guterres was due to visit a centre for demobilised former militia fighters in Goma.
According to the Group of Experts on Congo from New York University and Human Rights Watch, armed groups killed 1,900 civilians and kidnapped more than 3,300 people in the region between June 2017 and June 2019.

Ebola toll rising

The demobilisation of militias is a priority for MONUSCO, which has been present in the DRC since 1999.
On Sunday, Guterres will visit Beni, one of the epicentres of the Ebola epidemic, about 350 kilometres north of Goma.
DRC health officials said late Thursday that there have been "2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)" since August 2018.
It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016.
Containment efforts have been hindered by conflict in the country's east, as well as attacks on health workers tackling Ebola.
Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018, visiting a treatment centre and meeting survivors and health workers.
As the battle against Ebola continues, former health minister Oly Ilunga, who stepped down after criticising plans by the UN's World Health Organisation to introduce a second, unlicensed vaccine to the country, has been banned from leaving the country pending a probe into improper use of public funds, according to migration service documents seen by AFP on Saturday.
Ilunga has been questioned as part of an inquiry into the misuse of Ebola funds. Shortly before he stepped down, the minister had been replaced by President Felix Tshisekedi as the head of the country's Ebola response team.

Militia attacks

Apart from Ebola, Beni has been reeling under attacks since October 2014 with civilians and farmers bearing the brunt of the violence.
Most of the killings have been attributed to the Islamist-rooted Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 and has been accused of butchering hundreds of civilians.
"We are entirely by the side of the Congolese authorities in the fight against ADF," Guterres said in Goma.
ADF fighters have also targeted UN troops, killing 15 people in an attack in December.

"We want more military means to be put at their disposal to finish the ADF in Beni," mayor Bwanakawa Masumbuko said.
Guterres will end his tour in the capital Kinshasa, where he will meet Tshisekedi, who recently unveiled a new coalition government after a delay of nearly eight months.

Title: President's 'okunyonyola' method is paying off - New Vision Official
Aug 05, 2019
By Mary Karooro OkurutIt is critical to note that throughout the President's three month's countrywide wealth creation campaign, especially at a household level, he has moved by road, demonstrating by example that every part of the country can now be accessed without delay or difficulty.The President's method of reaching out to the people and making them understand the message, has always been through (Okunyonyola) Luganda for (explain, enlighten, expounding), as opposed to mere lecturing.With his (Okunyonyola) mode of communication, the masses are able to understand and internalise his message of wealth creation.Okunyonyola means okushoborora in Lunyakitara, aiticaunun in Ateso, titolok in Luo.To appreciate the significance of opening up and connecting every part of the country with a modern road network, one needs to check the interaction on the President's social media pages: In one such response, a David Wozei commented on the revamping of the road to Kisoro, all the way to the border with the DRC: "I recall one of my journeys on that road with a university bus in 2004 up to Busnza (close to the DRC border). It was quite a journey! The road was rocky, locals had bicycles with special 26-rim tyres to handle the rocky terrain."On the Karamoja half of the campaign, Bikanga Muzamil noted: "A few years back, it was unpleasant to visit Karamoja. Even people rejected the position of being Karamoja ministers. But now, it is becoming a tourism hub."For many of these areas, inaccessibility did not just affect them economically. It also posed a security risk.In Karamoja, for example, marooned in their corner of the country and with no significant economic interaction with the rest of the population, herdsmen for long roamed the sub-region with thousands of unlicensed guns, terrorising their neighbours in Teso, robbing their cows and fermenting insecurity that for long destabilised the east and northeastern parts of the country.In the west, particularly in the Rwenzori, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) for long took advantage of the mountainous topography to occasionally terrorise local communities, the most infamous of which was the attack on Kicwamba Technical College in 1998, in which 80 students were burnt alive in their dormitories and 100 others abducted.Today, as Muzamil points out, Karamoja is fast opening Wealth creation campaign: President's ‘okunyonyola' method is paying off up to economic activity, especially in the fields of mining and tourism, facilitated by an all-weather road network, after the government undertook a successful disarmament of the rustlers in the early 2000s, which pacified the region.In the Rwenzori, ADF is now a thing of history after its thorough defeat by the UPDF.On Saturday, a few kilometres from Kicwamba Technical College - the scene of that horrific ADF massacre 21 years ago, the President on his way to Ntoroko stopped to admire the beauty and serenity of the area and responders in the comments section of his tweet marvelled at the beauty and engineering bend of that Bundibugyo-Fort Portal road, now a critical gateway to DRC.It was eloquent symbolism of how the fortunes of the area have significantly changed - for the better!Prioritising security and investing in highway roads like the Bundibugyo Fort Portal road, the Gulu-Nimule road, the Vurra-Oraba road, Ntungamo-Mirama Hills road, Moroto-Nakapiripirit, Mbarara-Kabale-Katuna road among others, has proved an invaluable enabler of trade with our neighbours and served to unlock our tourism potential, by making our touristic resources easily accessible.Today, we have a trade surplus with our regional neighbours to the tune of $2.3b as at the end of 2018 and our annual tourist arrivals have increased from a mere 260,000 as of 2007 at the end of the LRA insurgency, to the nearly two million today.Now, as we move to create new cities in response to increasing urbanisation, the focus is on the urban roads, to forestall the congestion and overcrowding that is often associated with emerging cities.Thus a key feature of the President's tours has been the commissioning of such urban roads in all municipalities, which have been constructed with the support of the World Bank under the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development programme.But as the President has repeatedly pointed out, this elaborate security and transport infrastructure cannot be an end in itself.Rather, it should be seen and utilised as an enabler to generate individual and household wealth, in pursuance of our national vision of a "transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country" by 2040.We should all embrace the agenda.The writer is the Minister for General Duties, Office of the Prime Minister

It is critical to note that throughout the President's three month's countrywide wealth creation campaign, especially at a household level, he has moved by road, demonstrating by example that every part of the country can now be accessed without delay or difficulty.
The President's method of reaching out to the people and making them understand the message, has always been through (Okunyonyola) Luganda for (explain, enlighten, expounding), as opposed to mere lecturing.
With his (Okunyonyola) mode of communication, the masses are able to understand and internalise his message of wealth creation.
Okunyonyola means okushoborora in Lunyakitara, aiticaunun in Ateso, titolok in Luo.
To appreciate the significance of opening up and connecting every part of the country with a modern road network, one needs to check the interaction on the President's social media pages: In one such response, a David Wozei commented on the revamping of the road to Kisoro, all the way to the border with the DRC: "I recall one of my journeys on that road with a university bus in 2004 up to Busnza (close to the DRC border). It was quite a journey! The road was rocky, locals had bicycles with special 26-rim tyres to handle the rocky terrain."
On the Karamoja half of the campaign, Bikanga Muzamil noted: "A few years back, it was unpleasant to visit Karamoja. Even people rejected the position of being Karamoja ministers. But now, it is becoming a tourism hub."
For many of these areas, inaccessibility did not just affect them economically. It also posed a security risk.
In Karamoja, for example, marooned in their corner of the country and with no significant economic interaction with the rest of the population, herdsmen for long roamed the sub-region with thousands of unlicensed guns, terrorising their neighbours in Teso, robbing their cows and fermenting insecurity that for long destabilised the east and northeastern parts of the country.
In the west, particularly in the Rwenzori, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) for long took advantage of the mountainous topography to occasionally terrorise local communities, the most infamous of which was the attack on Kicwamba Technical College in 1998, in which 80 students were burnt alive in their dormitories and 100 others abducted.
Today, as Muzamil points out, Karamoja is fast opening Wealth creation campaign: President's ‘okunyonyola' method is paying off up to economic activity, especially in the fields of mining and tourism, facilitated by an all-weather road network, after the government undertook a successful disarmament of the rustlers in the early 2000s, which pacified the region.
In the Rwenzori, ADF is now a thing of history after its thorough defeat by the UPDF.
On Saturday, a few kilometres from Kicwamba Technical College - the scene of that horrific ADF massacre 21 years ago, the President on his way to Ntoroko stopped to admire the beauty and serenity of the area and responders in the comments section of his tweet marvelled at the beauty and engineering bend of that Bundibugyo-Fort Portal road, now a critical gateway to DRC.
It was eloquent symbolism of how the fortunes of the area have significantly changed - for the better!
Prioritising security and investing in highway roads like the Bundibugyo Fort Portal road, the Gulu-Nimule road, the Vurra-Oraba road, Ntungamo-Mirama Hills road, Moroto-Nakapiripirit, Mbarara-Kabale-Katuna road among others, has proved an invaluable enabler of trade with our neighbours and served to unlock our tourism potential, by making our touristic resources easily accessible.
Today, we have a trade surplus with our regional neighbours to the tune of $2.3b as at the end of 2018 and our annual tourist arrivals have increased from a mere 260,000 as of 2007 at the end of the LRA insurgency, to the nearly two million today.
Now, as we move to create new cities in response to increasing urbanisation, the focus is on the urban roads, to forestall the congestion and overcrowding that is often associated with emerging cities.
Thus a key feature of the President's tours has been the commissioning of such urban roads in all municipalities, which have been constructed with the support of the World Bank under the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development programme.
But as the President has repeatedly pointed out, this elaborate security and transport infrastructure cannot be an end in itself.
Rather, it should be seen and utilised as an enabler to generate individual and household wealth, in pursuance of our national vision of a "transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country" by 2040.
We should all embrace the agenda.

According to the latest weekly bulletin from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office, the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to rage in Beni and Mandima, with 60% of the cases confirmed in the last week coming from one of those towns.
In the past 21 days, 45% of new cases have come from Beni, and 22% from Mandima, the WHO said.
In addition to high viral activity, Beni has seen increased unrest and violence linked to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group based in Uganda and the DRC, in recent weeks.
"The security situation increased in volatility as a result of a surge in attacks from suspected ADF elements in Beni Health Zone and successive demonstrations," the WHO said. "A recent attack in Mbau on the Beni/Oicha axis led to the deaths of six civilians, including a prominent civil society leader.  EVD operations in the area were temporarily suspended with resumption pending improvement in the security situation."
Regional instability has been identified as one of the main drivers of this outbreak, which has now lasted over 1 year, despite an effective Ebola vaccine. Both community trust in response workers, and the response workers' inability to perform full surveillance in the aftermath of attacks, lead to ongoing transmission.
Though cases have been concentrated in Beni and Mandima, a new health zone, Lolwa in Ituri province, has reported a confirmed case, bringing the number of affected health zones to 27. In the past 3 weeks, 17 health zones have reported at least one confirmed case.
Currently, contact tracing is ongoing in 19 health zones, with about 85% of contacts successfully tracked.
Two Ebola patients in Goma have been successfully treated for the virus and survived their infections, according to media reports. To date, four cases have been identified in the major city that borders Rwanda. Two of the patients have died.
According to the WHO, all case contacts of the Goma patients are being actively followed, and 98% of case contacts of the Goma patients have been vaccinated.
The Daily Nation, a newspaper in Kenya, reported today that the surviving Goma patients are the wife and child of a miner from Ituri who died from his infection.
In related news, UNICEF announced today that the number of children orphaned by this outbreak has doubled since April and now stands at 1,380. An additional 2,469 children have been separated from their parents within the last year because of the outbreak.
"This disease has been especially harrowing for children," said Pierre Ferry, UNICEF's head of child protection programs in the DRC. "Children are watching parents die in front of them or seeing loved ones taken to Ebola treatment centers, uncertain of when or if they will return."
According to UNICEF, they have trained 906 psychosocial assistants and psychologists who provide a range of individualized assistance for orphaned and separated children.
The WHO Ebola dashboard shows 6 more cases today, raising the total to 2,837, with 334 suspected cases still under investigation. There are also 3 new deaths, and the fatality total stands at 1,891.

Title: RDC : Guterres a visité le centre de transit des ex-combattants près de Goma | Actualite.cd

Le secrétaire général de l’Onu, Antonio Guterres a visité ce samedi 31 août le centre de transit des anciens combattants que la Monusco gère à Munigi, près de Goma dans le cadre du processus de désarmement, démobilisation et réinsertion (DDR).
M. Guterres s’est entretenu avec les équipes qui travaillent de ce centre. Jusqu’à ce samedi, le centre de transit de Munigi héberge 30 individus, en raison de 21 ex combattants congolais (14 nyantura, 4 NDC/R, 2 APCLS, 1 MM Charles); 4 ex-combattants rwandais (2 FDLR/RUD, 1 FDLR/FOCA, 1 P5); 2 ex combattants malawites (2 P5); 1 ex combattant ougandais (FDLR/RUD); et 2 dépendants rwandais.
Selon les chiffres du service DDR de la Monusco, depuis le début 2019, le centre de transit de Munigi a accueilli plus de 700 ex-combattants et leurs dépendants (inclus les enfants associés aux forces et groupes armés). Plus de 500 étaient des congolais, 165 rwandais et 24 d'autres nationalités. La majorité des combattants congolais étaient affiliés aux groupes armés Nyantura et FDLR/CNRD, tandis-que pour les combattants rwandais, la majorité étaient des membres des FDLR/FOCA.
Le centre de transit de Munigi a été mis en place en 2014 dans le but de loger les combattants et leurs dépendants durant les phases volontaires du DDR et du DDRRR. Les combattants congolais sont ensuite transmis aux autorités nationales tandis-que les combattants étrangers et leurs dépendants sont rapatriés dans leur pays d'origine.

12.8 million People in need (Source: OCHA)
8 million IDPs displaced in DRC (Source: OCHA)

HIGHLIGHTS
A rapid response team including National Programme of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF) and IOM staff was deployed to South Kivu Province for rapid assessment and supporting the response following the two Ebola virus disease (EVD) positive cases confirmed in Mwenga territory, 90km from Bukavu (South Kivu Province).
During the reporting period, IOM organised two training courses for its partners on mobility trends monitoring, as well as on the Displacement Tracking Matrix. A total of 66 individuals participated in the trainings.
As of 15 August, over 11,400 Congolese returnees from Angola in Kasai and Kasai Central Provinces have been provided with onward transportation assistance to reach their preferred destinations.
SITUATION OVERVIEW
In its latest report published on 3 August 2019, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warns that the size of the humanitarian community within the territory of Masisi has drastically reduced from 73 to 28 actors in two years, a reduction of 62 per cent. The main cause of this reduction in the number of humanitarian actors in Masisi is a reduction in financial resources and a growing number of crises.
On 7 August, activities at POC Mavivi Barrier and PK5 (both in Beni, North Kivu Province) were suspended following public protests against the killing of civilians allegedly by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) at Mbau village. IOM's resumed it's activities on 8 August.
The Ministers of Health of Rwanda and the DRC met on 6 August in Rubavu, Rwanda for a bilateral meeting focused mainly on the Ebola response. As a result, the two states adopted a joint roadmap for response to the disease. This roadmap envisages to put in place common preventive and case management mechanisms (including surveillance, sharing information, vaccination). After adoption of the roadmap, a technical team is being set up for its implementation. Due to the high mobility flows, estimated at 64,000 persons per day through the border crossing point between Gisenyi (Rwanda) and Goma (DRC), both countries have also decided to put in place mechanisms to secure border crossings to prevent the spread of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).

Title: UN expresses solidarity with Ebola-hit DR Congo - Punch Newspapers
Most Widely Read Newspaper
Kindly share this story:
The UN secretary general first visited Goma, the capital of North Kivu province which is trying to roll back an epidemic of Ebola that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in a year.Guterres was received by Leila Zerrougui, his special representative in DR Congo.The two did not shake hands, in line with health protocols aimed at curbing the spread of the highly infectious and very often fatal disease.Guterres said he had come to express his support “with the armed forces of DRC in the fight against terrorism” which represents “a threat not only for the Congo but the whole of Africa.”The UN peacekeeping mission in the country known by its French acronym MONUSCO comprises some 16,000 troops and has an annual budget of over $1 billion.A total of 130 militias and armed groups roam the North and South Kivu provinces of DR Congo, a vast country the size of western continental Europe.At a centre for demobilised former militia fighters in Goma, Guterres appealed to the militias to choose peace.“It’s always possible to choose peace,” he said, urging all combatants to come “to a centre like this (for) a new life in peace in their home community.”He added he had heard moving testimony from people living in the bush under the illusion that by being in an armed group they could have a better life. The reality, he insisted, was that meant “a tragic life, a life without a future.”According to the Group of Experts on Congo from New York University and Human Rights Watch, armed groups killed 1,900 civilians and kidnapped more than 3,300 people in the region between June 2017 and June 2019.– Ebola toll rising –The demobilisation of militias is a priority for MONUSCO, which has been present in the DR Congo since 1999.On Sunday, Guterres will visit Beni, one of the epicentres of the Ebola epidemic, about 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma.DR Congo health officials said late Thursday that there have been “2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)” since August 2018.It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016.Related NewsUN, FG honour victims of 2011 Abuja terrorist attack20 die in DR Congo boat accidentEkiti partners UN to reposition waste managementContainment efforts have been hindered by the conflict in the country’s east, as well as attacks on health workers tackling Ebola.Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018, visiting a treatment centre and meeting survivors and health workers.As the battle against Ebola continues, former health minister Oly Ilunga, who stepped down after criticising plans by the UN’s World Health Organization to introduce a second, unlicensed vaccine to the country, has been banned from leaving the country pending a probe into improper use of public funds, according to migration service documents seen by AFP on Saturday.Ilunga has been questioned as part of an inquiry into the misuse of Ebola funds. Shortly before he stepped down, the minister was replaced by President Felix Tshisekedi as the head of the country’s Ebola response team.– Militia attacks –Apart from Ebola, Beni has been reeling under militia attacks since October 2014 with civilians and farmers bearing the brunt of the violence.Most of the killings have been attributed to the Islamist-rooted Allied Democratic Forces (ADF)  group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 and has been accused of butchering hundreds of civilians.“We are entirely by the side of the Congolese authorities in the fight against ADF,” Guterres said in Goma.The country’s armed forces Saturday put at 1,662 the number of soldiers killed since 2014 fighting the ADF in and around Beni.ADF fighters have also targeted UN troops, killing 15 people in an attack in December.Under the terms of its latest mandate spanning April to December this year, the UN has closed bases in the DR Congo, reviewed its intervention strategy and cut civilian staff by 764 since the beginning of July.But in Beni, prominent locals called for the UN to beef up the capacity of its rapid intervention force.“We want more military means to be put at their disposal to finish the ADF in Beni,” mayor Bwanakawa Masumbuko said.Guterres will end his tour in the capital Kinshasa, where he will meet Tshisekedi, who recently unveiled a new coalition government after a delay of nearly eight months.AFP

Title: UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses solidarity with Ebola-hit DR Congo
UN chief Antonio Guterres started a three-day tour of the Democratic Republic of Congo Saturday, expressing "solidarity" with a region ravaged by violence and an Ebola epidemic. The secretary general first visited Goma, the capital of North Kivu province which is trying to roll back an epidemic of Ebola that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in a year.
Guterres was received by Leila Zerrougui, his special representative in the DR Congo. The two did not shake hands, in line with protocols aimed at curbing the spread of the highly infectious and potentially fatal disease. Guterres said he had come to express his support "with the armed forces of DRC in the fight against terrorism" which represents "a threat not only for the Congo but the whole of Africa."
The UN peacekeeping mission in the country known by its French acronym MONUSCO comprises some 16,000 troops and has an annual budget of over $1 billion. A total of 130 militias and armed groups roam the North and South Kivu provinces of DR Congo, a vast country the size of western continental Europe.
Guterres was due to visit a centre for demobilised former militia fighters in Goma.
According to the Group of Experts on Congo from New York University and Human Rights Watch, armed groups killed 1,900 civilians and kidnapped more than 3,300 people in the region between June 2017 and June 2019.

- Ebola toll rising -
The demobilisation of militias is a priority for MONUSCO, which has been present in the DR Congo since 1999. On Sunday, Guterres will visit Beni, one of the epicentres of the Ebola epidemic, about 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma. DR Congo health officials said late Thursday that there have been "2,006 deaths (1,901 confirmed and 105 probable)" since August 2018.
It is the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history after more than 11,000 people were killed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 2014 and 2016. Containment efforts have been hindered by conflict in the country's east, as well as attacks on health workers tackling Ebola.
Guterres will visit the remote area of Mangina in the bush outside Beni, where the epidemic first broke out at the end of July 2018, visiting a treatment centre and meeting survivors and health workers.
As the battle against Ebola continues, former health minister Oly Ilunga, who stepped down after criticising plans by the UN's World Health Organization to introduce a second, unlicensed vaccine to the country, has been banned from leaving the country pending a probe into improper use of public funds, according to migration service documents seen by AFP on Saturday.

Title: Detenidos 3 médicos congoleños por muerte de miembro de OMS en zona de ébola
Tres médicos congoleños fueron detenidos en la República Democrática del Congo (RDC), acusados de haber, presuntamente, organizado el asesinato de un epidemiólogo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) el pasado abril que trabajaba como parte de la respuesta al ébola.
