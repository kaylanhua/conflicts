Title: Uganda confirms hundreds of Congolese M23 rebels missing | News24
Friday, 20 September
19 Jan 2017
Kampala -  Hundreds of members of a Congolese rebel group have fled a military camp where they had been awaiting amnesty since the signing of a peace deal with Democratic Republic of Congo's government in 2013, Uganda's government said on Thursday.
Some members of M23, a Tutsi-led rebel group that once controlled vast territory in eastern DRC, "have been quietly escaping into the general public," government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo said in a statement.
Opondo said Ugandan authorities have arrested 101 M23 members, disguised as ordinary passengers, who were being ferried in four vehicles destined for DRC.
"Uganda will not and does not support any armed activities to destabilise the Democratic Republic of Congo," he said.
At least 270 M23 members are still detained in western Uganda, Opondo said.
It was not clear if M23 leader Sultani Makenga remained in the custody of Ugandan authorities.
Makenga is the subject of US sanctions, including a travel ban and assets freeze for "serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children" in armed conflict.
The news of missing M23 fighters is likely to alarm DRC's government, which has repeatedly urged Uganda's government to hold the rebels.
M23 launched its rebellion in eastern DRC in April 2012, becoming the latest reincarnation of a Tutsi rebel group dissatisfied with DRC's government, until it was repulsed by UN forces and DRC's army.
Many rebels fled to Rwanda and Uganda before a 2013 peace agreement.
At the time, Ugandan officials said about 1 700 M23 rebels had fled to Uganda, which was mediating talks between the rebels and DRC's government.

Alleged Congolese M23 rebels flee to Rwanda - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KIGALI, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Scores of alleged M23 rebels fled to Rwanda on Sunday evening through Rwanda's border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda's ministry of defense said Monday.
The ministry said in a statement that a group of 30 unarmed people claiming to be M23 combatants crossed into its territory in the border's Bugeshi sector, Rubavu district.
"The individuals are said to have fled from combat action by DRC Armed Forces (FARDC). They have been registered in Rwanda and those in need of medical attention have been received by the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) in accordance with international humanitarian law," said Rene Ngendahimana, Rwanda's defense spokesperson.
M23 used to be the most prominent rebel group operating in eastern Congo before it was repulsed by UN forces fighting with the Congolese national army.
In 2012, more than 25,000 Congolese refugees entered Rwanda as a result of resurgence of conflict in eastern DRC.
Close to 18,000 live in the Kigeme refugee camp in southern Rwanda and another 7,766 are housed at the Nkamira transit camp in Rubavu.
In 2013, over 1,000 rebels fled to Rwanda and Uganda before their leaders signed a peace agreement with DRC government.
Under that agreement, the rebels who fled to neighboring countries were to be repatriated back to Congo within a year. That has proved difficult due to questions over an amnesty.
The M23 rebels want a blanket amnesty but the DRC government insists some must be tried for crimes committed in eastern Congo.
The crisis in the DRC escalated in April 2009 following mutiny by a group of soldiers of the Congolese army claiming the Congolese government had violated a 2009 peace agreement.
They formed the M23 rebel group, which is mainly made up of soldiers from a now-defunct National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP).

Title: At least 6 hacked to death in fresh 'rebel' attacks in DRC | News24
Friday, 20 September
02 Jan 2017
Kinshasa - At least six people were hacked to death in troubled northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo in two attacks last week, blamed on Ugandan rebels, a regional official told AFP on Monday.
The government and the UN mission in the central African country Monusco have accused the shadowy rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), dominated by hardline Ugandan Muslims, of carrying out a two-year bloodbath in the region.
"There have been attacks blamed on suspected ADF members near the border with Nord Kivu (province), which left at least six people dead in Irumu territory," the vice governor of Ituri province, Pacifique Keta, said.
Keta added that the death toll was provisional and security had been beefed up.
Separately, Gill Gotabo, a civil society leader in Ituri, reported that 14 people were killed in the attacks, which took place in the villages of Saboko and Bialee.
Irumu territory in Ituri province is near Beni in neighbouring Nord Kivu province - the main target of attacks where the ADF are alleged to have massacred around 700 people, many of them hacked to death.
The ADF has not claimed any of the Beni massacres. Experts on DRC have not found any link between the group and the global jihadist underground.
Others have alleged that government agents have had a role in the killing - claims Kinshasa rejects.
A report by experts in March said members of the Congolese army, former rebels from the RCD-K/ML group - who held the area during the 1998-2003 Second DRC War - and local militias were all involved in the mass killings.
In explaining the violence, some experts have cited struggles for control of trafficking in various industries like timber, agricultural produce or minerals in a region with extremely rich potential.

The representatives of the Guarantors of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the region (PSC Framework) held a meeting in Addis, Ethiopia, on 27 January 2017, on the margins of the African Union (AU) Summit. The meeting was chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs of Angola, Hon. Mr. Georges Chikoti, representing the Chair of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and Chair of the Regional Oversight Mechanism (ROM), H. E. President José Eduardo Dos Santos. It was attended by Mr. Saïd Djinnit, the United Nations Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region; Amb. Zachary Muburi-Muita, ICGLR Executive Secretary; Dr. Stergomena Tax, Southern African Development Community (SADC) Executive Secretary; Mr. Maman Sidikou, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in the DRC and Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO); Amb. Abdou Abarry, Special Representative and Head of the AU Office in the DRC, representing AU Commissioner for Peace and Security, Amb. Smaïl Chergui. Other senior officials from the Guarantors’ institutions also attended the meeting.
Participants reviewed recent developments in the region and discussed efforts to address instability in eastern DRC, including support to the neutralization of armed groups. They also discussed dialogue processes in the DRC and Burundi.
The Guarantors expressed concern on the continuous activities by negative forces in eastern DRC, in particular, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDRL). They reiterated the commitments of their respective organizations to tackle the threat posed by these negative forces, in line with the decisions of the Sixth Ordinary Summit of the ICGLR and the Seventh High-Level Meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism of the PSC Framework held in Luanda, Angola, on 14 June and 26 October respectively, as well as other relevant decisions of the ICGLR, SADC, AU and the UN. In particular, the meeting:
• Urged the Chiefs of Defense Staff/Forces of ICGLR and SADC countries to carry out a field mission to the affected areas in eastern DRC, including the camps hosting ex-combatants as recommended by the meeting of Ministers of Defense of ICGLR and SADC held in Nairobi on 20 July 2016 and to engage MONUSCO Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) and DRC officials in order to make appropriate recommendations to further strengthen operations to fully neutralize persisting negative forces.
• Encouraged the Office of the Special Envoy and the ICGLR Secretariat to pursue their ongoing efforts towards convening a dedicated meeting on the issue of natural resources aimed at undercutting the lifelines of negative forces.
• Welcomed ongoing efforts by the ICGLR to establish the Joint Follow-up Mechanism (JFM) comprising the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to address the growing menace posed by ADF including recruitment drive in the wider region, and noted the advanced plans towards the operationalization of this mechanism.
• Further welcomed ongoing efforts to accelerate the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement of disarmed combatants in Eastern DRC and the region.

Title: Top UN peacekeeping official pushes for endorsement of DR Congo political accord - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
Addressing the Security Council, the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations today urged the international community to push for a swift endorsement of the so-called 31 December political accord in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and to put in place a transitional government of national unity.
“The signing of the 31 December accord gives hope for a peaceful resolution of the political impasse,” the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Hervé Ladsous, told the 15-member Council.
He warned that failure to sign the agreement – facilitated by Conférence Episcopale Nationale du Congo (CENCO) mediators, and reached in DRC’s capital, Kinshasa, on 31 December 2016 – could delay elections and increase the risk of renewed political crisis and increased violence in the country.
“Regional and international actors should maintain strong support for the implementation of the accord and the holding of elections, as soon as feasible,” Mr. Ladsous said.
The accord builds on an initial political agreement between part of the opposition and themajorité présidentiellereached in October under the auspices of the African Union facilitation. It aims for a peacefully managed transition consistent with the democratic principles enshrined in the country’s Constitution.
In addition to political developments in the country, Mr. Ladsous addressed recent human rights violations and acts of violence that occurred on 19 and 20 December. At least 42 people were killed and 140 others injured in clashed between national security forces and demonstrators.
The senior UN official called on the Congolese Government “to initiate a full investigation into the events that led to the excessive use of force and loss of life” during that time period, and to ensure that those responsible are held to account.
He went on to cite the ongoing volatility in the security situation in eastern DRC. In addition to the threat posed by foreign armed groups, namely the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and theForces démocratiques pour la libération du Rwanda(FDLR), the activities of militia groups are on the rise in many parts of the country. “This increase in levels of armed violence is driven in part by the escalation of deep-rooted and long-standing conflicts between ethnic communities,” he noted.
Mr. Ladsous said that the UN Secretariat and the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the country (MONUSCO) remain committed to working in support of the accord and the Congolese, and will present to the Security Council recommendations for how to best attain this goal.
