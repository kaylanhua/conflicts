Title: Congolese rebels advance in east – DW – 07/08/2012
The M23 rebel group has continued its advance against government troops in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Members of the group have seized the town of Rutshuru.
Renegade soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) captured another city in the volatile eastern part of the county on Sunday, sending government troops fleeing as violence escalates there.
Members of the M23 rebel movement seized the town of Rutshuru in the resource rich eastern province of Nord Kivu, which borders Uganda.
"We took control of the town of Rutshuru before noon and sent the (Congolese army) fleeing," Colonel Vianney Kazarama of the M23 movement told the Reuters news agency by telephone.
On Friday, the M23 rebels had captured a key border post, Bunagana, on the Ugandan frontier after a repelling a government offensive. Some 600 government troops fled across the border to seek refuge in Uganda.
Mutinous soldiers
The M23 movement is made up of former ethnic Tutsi rebels who integrated themselves into the DRC's national military under a 2009 peace accord. But they split from the military in April, reportedly over a dispute about pay and conditions. M23 refers to the date in March when the accord was signed.
The group's suspected leader, General Bosco Ntaganda, is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of war crimes. Ntaganda allegedly conscripted child soldiers under the age of 15 between 2002 and 2003.
Plagued by violence
Turmoil has gripped the DRC's eastern provinces since the split in military, ending nearly two years of peace. The violence has displaced some 200,000 people and forced another 20,000 to flee to neighboring countries such as Rwanda and Uganda.
The DRC is similar in size to Western Europe and has a population of more than 73 million people. Although the DRC is rich with natural resources, its people are among the most impoverished in the world.
The US Geological Survey has reported that around 70 percent of the planet's coltan is located in the DRC, an ore that is critical for the manufacture of electronics. Some 40 percent of the world's cobalt and a third of its diamonds are also located in the central African nation.
The country has suffered two majors over the past 20 years, which took the lives of nearly 5 million people and left the nation in ruin.

Title: 'The security situation in the DRC is improving' – DW – 03/25/2019
The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo Leila Zerrougui believes that the peace mission MONUSCO has contributed towards greater security in the DRC.
In an interview with DW the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), Leila Zerrougui, acknowledged that there are stillhuge challengesahead in the country, including the professionalization of the army and border control. But she feels confident that the situation in the DRC is improving.
DW: In 2019, MONUSCO will have been in the DRC for 20 years. What has really changed in that time, especially in terms of security and above all for the populations in the east of the country?
Leila Zerrougui: A lot of things. First, while we are in a country that still has armed groups in at least six of the 26 provinces, there are no territories left where the government troops cannot penetrate. There are still enormous challenges with regard to the professionalization of the army, with regard to the professionalization of the police, the sovereign functioning of the state and border control. But there is progress, thanks also to all the work and efforts of the international community. I think this year we will do an evaluation with the competent authorities to ascertain what we have already achieved and how we will move forward together.
If you tell the people of Beni, for example, that the situation has improved a lot, they will probably laugh. Or cry, because the ADF militia (Alliance of Democratic Forces) still attacks the population on a regular basis. What are they telling you? How do they react?
Almost 70% of our troops have been deployed in the Beni region. We have the FIB (rapid reaction force) and special forces there. We have a lot of people there, because it is an area that needs our protection. There is progress. We are after all talking about a territory of 2.5 million square kilometers (1.5 million square miles).
DW: The rapid reaction force FIB was created in 2013 and had a spectacular success in 2013 with its victory over the M23 militia. We haven't heard much from it since then.
And yet we've had the highest number ofsoldiers killedin the area of Beni in 2017. It was hard for me meeting with their families in in Tanzania, in Malawi. me. Peacekeepers are forced to wage war there, when they are supposed to bring peace. It's much more complicated than we think.
You mentioned the progress made by the country, but you also named territories where there is ongoing. There's Kasai, Tanganyika, Ituri. Wouldn't you say these conditions do not speak for a withdrawal of MONUSCO?
Many armed groups are surrendering. Now the challenge will be integrating them. We can see this phenomenon in Ituri with the FRPI (Forces de Resistance Patriotique de l'Ituri) and also in Tanganyika. There is hope. But it's not going to be done in two months.
So the mission won't leave right away? In view of the work still to be done, like the training of the Congolese army you've mentioned, will the mission stay on for a while?
The President of the Republic [Felix Tshisekedi, editor's note] asked for some time to identify priorities and start the drop-down and departure of MONUSCO. No one, neither the former president [Joseph Kabila] nor the current one is asking for MONUSCO to stay forever. And I do not believe that those who decide on our mandate have that intention.
The ADF are a difficult enemy, a militia that is difficult to fight. Is a dialogue with the ADF even possible since it is not a unified structure, but rather a dispersed militia?
It is not a militia - it is an armed group that settled in the DRC in the 1980s. Mobutu [Former President of Zaire – now DRC – Mobutu Sese Seko] gave them this territory. So they consider it to be their own.

And they also mingle with the population...
Of course, because there are marriages and there is also the economy. They sell gold and wood to neighboring countries. There is an economic dimension and there is a social dimension. We should obviously be careful not to end up with an armed group that could grow an international rather than regional dimension, affectingUganda and Congo.
I do not believe that problems are solved by force alone. Of course, we're not going to stand them up against a wall and shoot them. They have children, they have women. Are we going to kill them all? We have to take care of them, to integrate them. There is always a social dimension, a political dimension, a dimension that allows us to turn the page. If we don't turn the page, instability will prevail.

Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni on Friday said his country was ready to defeat any aggression as tensions with neighboring Rwanda rose.
Museveni who was speaking at celebrations to mark International Women’s day in the Rwenzori region, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, urged people ‘not to be scared’.
“No one will disturb the peace in Uganda. The peace will be maintained. The ADF are in Congo and the conflict will remain there. Whoever wants to cause conflict in Kasese, will not manage,” a statement posted on the state house website read in part.
Kampala and Kigali have traded accusations of hostilities in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Rwandan Foreign Minister Richard Sezibera accused Uganda of providing bases to two rebel groups – Rwanda National Congress (RNC) and Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
“RNC and FDLR work from Uganda with support of some authorities there. This is another serious case and we have raised it with them,” he told a news conference in Kigali.
The RNC is a rebel group led by some of Rwanda’s most prominent dissidents including South Africa-based Kayumba Nyamwasa. Its founders say it is a political party.
The FDLR is a rebel group composed in part of former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militias who fled into Democratic Republic of Congo after massacring around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus during Rwanda’s 1994 genocide.
A statement by Uganda’s foreign minister denied the accusations.
This week, Ugandan media reported that Rwanda was amassing troops near its border with Uganda. Rwanda last week shut its Katuna border to traffic to and from Uganda citing repair works. Kigali has also advised its nationals from traveling to Kampala.
Ugandan media reported on Friday that Museveni had advised government officials to ignore provocations by Kigali.

Title: Implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region - Report of the Secretary-General (S/2019/229) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 12 more
I. Introduction
1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Councilresolution 2409 (2018), by which the Council requested me to report on the implementation of the commitments under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. It provides an overview of peace and security developments in the Great Lakes region since the issuance of my previous report (S/2018/886) and covers the period from 1 September 2018 to 28 February 2019.
II. Major developments
A. Security situation
2. The activities of foreign and domestic illegal armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, cross-border security incidents, insecurity in the Central African Republic, sporadic fighting between Government and opposition forces in South Sudan and clashes between the Burundian armed forces and armed groups had a negative impact on peace and stability in the Great Lakes region during the reporting period.
3. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tensions were reported before and after the elections of 30 December 2018 and included instances of protests, violence, clashes between supporters of opposing parties and heavy-handed dispersion of demonstrators by security forces. On a positive note, armed groups that had been very vocal about the outcome of the elections appear to have adopted a “wait and see” approach since the proclamation of the final results of the presidential election. In the Kasai region, an uptrend in the number of Kamuina Nsapu militia members laying down their weapons was recorded during the same period. In Mai-Ndombe Province, the security situation in Yumbi territory remains of concern, after violence broke out between the Batende and Banunu ethnic groups, which a human rights investigation confirmed had resulted in 535 deaths.
4. In the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) stepped up attacks in the Beni area, targeting civilians, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). At least 245 civilians, including 55 women and seven children, were killed in attacks attributed to ADF in 2018. The group reportedly continued to recruit followers from countries in the Great Lakes region and beyond. On 12 November, FARDC and MONUSCO launched a joint military operation against the group to prevent a potential attack on Beni town and to protect civilians. A total of 13 FARDC soldiers and seven United Nations peacekeepers were killed during the operation. On 20 November, the military spokesperson of Uganda announced the deployment of approximately 4,000 troops along the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to prevent infiltration and attacks by ADF. In Ituri Province, as dialogue on demobilization and disarmament continued between the Government and the rebel Force de résistance patriotique en Ituri, the parties met on 20 January, discussed pre-cantonment and financial issues and agreed on a security assessment of pre-cantonment sites, as well as meetings with provincial authorities. Meanwhile, subgroups of the Lord’s Resistance Army have become more active in Haut-Uélé Province, and the latter half of January saw an increase in the number of incidents attributed to this armed group.
5. On 15 December, FARDC arrested the spokesperson and deputy head of intelligence of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR), and media sources reported their extradition to Rwanda in January. While the extradition and repatriation of disarmed FDLR combatants weakened the group, FDLR remained active. On 16 and 17 December, seven FARDC soldiers were reportedly killed in two separate attacks by suspected FDLR rebels. Military operations in December and January against an FDLR splinter group, Conseil national pour le renouveau et la démocratie-Ubwiyunge, forced the latter to abandon positions in North Kivu and move into South Kivu.
6. In Burundi, the security situation remained relatively calm yet unpredictable and was marked by isolated security incidents. On 4 September, unidentified armed individuals attacked Nkurubuye colline in Ruyigi Province, along the border between Burundi and the United Republic of Tanzania. On 19 October, suspected elements of the Burundian armed group Résistance pour un état de droit au Burundi-Tabara (RED-Tabara) attacked an army position in Bubanza Province. Burundian armed forces captured two assailants, while the others reportedly fled into the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
7. The security situation in the Central African Republic remained fragile. On 15 November, the Union pour la paix en Centrafrique, an armed group affiliated with the ex-Séléka, together with armed civilians, attacked the camp for displaced persons in Alindao. Between 70 and 100 civilians among the estimated 18,000 civilians hosted in the camp were killed. In addition, some armed groups continued to acquire weapons and ammunition from neighbouring countries, as reported by the Panel of Experts on the Central African Republic in its reportS/2018/1119.
8. In South Sudan, sporadic fighting between the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces and opposition forces, as well as among opposition groups, continued. Incidents of intercommunal and intracommunal violence were also reported, resulting in civilian casualties and displacement.
9. Cross-border security incidents were reported in the areas between Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, contributing to enhanced tensions between Burundi and Rwanda. On 15 September, suspected elements of the Forces nationales de libération (FNL) reportedly entered Burundi from South Kivu to attack a border post at Gatumba. On 19 September, a local leader of the Imbonerakure, the ruling party’s youth wing, was killed with his wife, near the border with Rwanda. The Ministry of Public Security of Burundi attributed the attack to an armed group from Rwanda. On 7 October, unidentified armed elements reportedly from Rwanda killed three civilians in Cibitoke Province in Burundi. Also, in October, FARDC reportedly clashed with FNL in South Kivu. Furthermore, the Burundian national defence force was reported to have entered South Kivu between November and January, in pursuit of Burundian armed elements. Deadly clashes were also reported between the Burundian national defence force, supported by Imbonerakure, and RED-Tabara, as well as FNL.
10. Armed groups also staged attacks targeting Rwanda. On 10 December, the FDLR-Forces combattantes abacunguzi made a cross-border incursion into Busesamana village, in Rubavu district in Rwanda, and killed at least three soldiers, according to the Government of Rwanda. On 15 December, unidentified armed attackers, reportedly coming from Burundi, launched an attack in Kitabi Sector, southern Rwanda, setting fire to three passenger vehicles and killing two civilians. According to Rwanda’s military spokesperson, three of the attackers were killed, while the rest fled to Burundi.
11. The Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported the presence of an armed coalition known as “P5” associated with Rwandan opposition groups, which was active in South Kivu and reportedly received arms and ammunition from Burundi.
12. In September, the follow-up mechanism for the repatriation of former combatants, launched on 24 April 2018, facilitated the repatriation of 11 disarmed FDLR combatants to Rwanda from the Walungu transit camp, in South Kivu. In November, another 52 disarmed FDLR combatants and dependants volunteered for repatriation. This brought the total number of disarmed FDLR combatants repatriated through the follow-up mechanism since April 2018 to 98.
13. Between 20 and 27 November, Congolese authorities, through bilateral arrangements with the Government of Rwanda, repatriated 1,392 disarmed FDLR combatants and dependants, following the closure of transit camps in Kanyobagonga, Kisangani and Walungu, in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Furthermore, 242 FDLR elements previously detained in the Angenga prison, in Equateur Province, were handed over to Rwanda. All disarmed combatants were transferred to the Mutobo Demobilization and Reintegration Camp in Rwanda.
14. In another positive development, in October, cooperation between the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and MONUSCO resulted in the relocation out of MONUSCO premises of the remaining 51 members of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition, who had been in the care of MONUSCO since August 2016.

Title: Islamic militants kill 6 Christians in Congo, 470 families flee violence: report | World
The Christian Post

Six Christians, including a 9-year-old child, were reportedly killed in a recent attack in a predominantly Christian village in the northeast Democratic Republic of Congo.
Open Doors USA, a Christian persecution watchdog nonprofit active in 60 countries,reportsthat nearly 500 families fled from their homes when rebel forces attacked the largely Christian village of Kalau near the city of Beni in DRC’s North Kivu province.
The attack reportedly lasted about four hours and is believed to have been perpetrated by the Allied Democratic Forces, a militant group active in the North Kivu province of the DRC and Uganda.
Launched in the mid-1990s by Ugandan Muslim rebels forced out of Uganda, the ADF has become theconflict-strickenDRC’s most active and violent rebel group over the past two years.
Sources with knowledge of the attack in Kalau told the charity that the attackers pretended to be security agents when they arrived in the village.
The imposters reached the village center before there was any suspicion that they weren’t who they said they were. By that point, the rebels began firing their weapons at the villagers. Among those killed in the attack are the 9-year-old child and at least three women.
“A nurse in the Nyankunde hospital in Beni told Open Doors by phone that the attackers then proceeded toward the house of the village head,” the Open Doorsreportstates.  “When they shot dead the guard dogs, the gunfire sent people running. Two villagers attempting to flee were killed.”
Pastor Gilbert Kambale, who operates a civil society organization based in Beni, told Open Doors that 470 Congo families fled to Beni following the incident.
Many of the families were sheltered by host families or were given refuge inside of schools in Beni’s Beu Commune.
The Beni area is no stranger to violence caused by the ADF as hundreds of civilians have been killed in the area over the past five years.
According to Open Doors, ADF is believed to have killed at least 700 civilians and more than 20 United Nations peacekeepers
In August 2016, ADF was blamed for carrying out what is known as the “Beni massacre,” where at least 64 werehacked to death.
Open Doors expects that more violence is likely to come in the future.
“We have heard the rebels saying they worked for long in the domains of kidnapping and killings, but now they want to move to the stage of occupying the territory,” a local community leader told Open Doors. “They want to occupy the area they claim as theirs.”
The North Kivu province is also in the midst of an eight-month Ebola outbreak. ADF forces are blamed for hampering Ebola relief efforts and attacks against Ebola treatment centers. At least one clinic was burned down.
According toEleanor Beevor from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ADF is thought to be responsible for the killings of at least 249 people in 2018.
According to theCongo Research Groupat New York University, an ADF member posted at least 35 videos on private social media channels that either mentioned or showed militant attacks, contained Quranic readings, and images of indoctrination and propaganda messages, between 2016 and 2017.
Conflict has plagued Africa's second largest nation for decades. According to the Christian humanitarian organizationWorld Vision, at least 2.1 million people in DRC were newly displaced in 2017 and 2018. With about 4.5 million displaced, DRC has the highest number of internally displaced people in Africa.

Title: Uganda Calls for Coordinated Action Against Militants
Print
Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, has called for more coordinated action to deal with militants in Africa's Great Lakes region. Meanwhile, the United Nations has urged countries to address the root causes of conflicts in the region that have created over 4 million refugees and displaced millions more.
At a Great Lakes security conference Thursday in Kampala, Museveni said he wanted more active cooperation in confronting the region's militants.
"Like the problem of Eastern Congo, I'm sure, if the countries of this area acted together, that problem could be solved. It's not such a big problem. Even the problem of Somalia, if it was not for this theater in which we are engaged, we could solve that problem by having enough action," Museveni said.
Uganda has deployed more than 6,000 troops to Somalia under the African Union Mission to fight the al-Shabab terrorist group.
Meanwhile, conflict in Great Lakes countries like Burundi, the Central African Republic and South Sudan has created over 4 million refugees in recent years and displaced millions more.
Uganda has been praised for hosting an estimated 1.1 million refugees — the largest number for any country in Africa. However, Uganda's minister for relief and refugees, Hillary Onek, warned that the country would not be exploited.
"We shall continue to be hospitable, but we should not be used by other people to solve their problems. Refugees have come, we shall look after them. And when your country is peaceful, they can return. But people want to exploit the situation to become refugees but, whereas they don't really have problems in their country, so, they want to use our hospitality for wrong reasons," she said.
Speaking at the conference Thursday, United Nations Special Envoy Said Djinnit urged the Great Lakes countries to address the root cause of conflicts in the region.
Djinnit blamed conflict over land, resources, corruption and poor governance for fueling the fighting. He cited Uganda's repatriation of 57 former M23 rebels to the Democratic Republic of Congo as an example of cross-border cooperation to help end conflict.
"When there's determination, we brought together the leaders of the countries, they took the decision, they established the mechanism and, therefore, relieved this country from this burden," he said. "And remove that problem between Uganda and the DRC. Because as long as the M23 are in Uganda, there is still that impression that [they] may have some kind of support in Uganda."
The M23 fighters crossed into Uganda in 2013 after intense fighting with DRC-backed U.N. forces.

DR Congo+ 12 more
I. Introduction
1. Établi en application de larésolution 2409 (2018)du Conseil de sécurité, par laquelle le Conseil m’a prié de lui présenter un rapport sur le respect des engagements pris dans l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la République démocratique du Congo et la région, le présent rapport donne un aperçu de l’évolution de la situation en matière de paix et de sécurité dans la région des Grands Lacs depuis la publication de mon précédent rapport (S/2018/886) et couvre la période allant du 1er septembre 2018 au 28 février 2019.
II. Principaux faits nouveaux
A. Conditions de sécurité
2. Pendant la période considérée, la paix et la stabilité dans la région des Grands Lacs ont été mises à mal par les activités des groupes armés illégaux étrangers et nationaux en République démocratique du Congo, les atteintes à la sécurité en zone transfrontalière, l’insécurité en République centrafricaine, les combats sporadiques entre les forces gouvernementales et les forces d’opposition au Soudan du Sud et les affrontements entre les forces armées burundaises et les groupes armés.
3. En République démocratique du Congo, des tensions ont été signalées avant et après les élections du 30 décembre 2018, notamment des manifestations, des violences, des affrontements entre partisans de partis opposés ainsi que la dispersion brutale de manifestants par les forces de sécurité. Sur une note plus positive, les groupes armés dont les prises de position avaient été les plus virulentes ont semble-t-il adopté une approche attentiste depuis la proclamation des résultats définitifs de l’élection présidentielle. Dans la région du Kasaï, on a enregistré pendant la même période une augmentation du nombre de membres de la milice Kamuina Nsapu qui déposent les armes. Dans la province du Maï-Ndombe, les conditions de sécurité dans le territoire de Yumbi demeurent préoccupantes, après l’éclatement de violences entre les groupes ethniques Batende et Banunu, qui, comme l’a confirmé une enquête sur les droits de l’homme, ont fait 535 morts.
4. Dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo, des membres présumés des Forces démocratiques alliées (ADF) ont intensifié leurs attaques dans la région de Beni, ciblant des civils, les Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo (FARDC) et la Mission de l’Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo (MONUSCO). Au moins 245 civils, dont 55 femmes et 7 enfants, ont été tués dans des attaques attribuées aux ADF en 2018. Le groupe aurait continué à recruter dans les pays de la région des Grands Lacs et au-delà. Le 12 novembre, pour prévenir une attaque potentielle contre la ville de Beni et protéger les civils, les FARDC et la MONUSCO ont lancé une opération militaire conjointe contre les ADF au cours de laquelle 13 soldats des FARDC et sept soldats de la paix des Nations Unies ont été tués. Le 20 novembre, le porte-parole militaire de l’Ouganda a annoncé le déploiement d’environ 4 000 soldats le long de la frontière avec la République démocratique du Congo pour empêcher les infiltrations et les attaques des ADF. Dans la province de l’Ituri, alors que le dialogue sur la démobilisation et le désarmement se poursuivait entre le Gouvernement et le groupe rebelle Force de résistance patriotique de l’Ituri, les parties se sont rencontrées le 20 janvier, ont examiné les questions relatives au précantonnement et aux aspects financiers et ont convenu de procéder à une évaluation de la sécurité des sites de précantonnement et de tenir des réunions avec les autorités provinciales. Dans le même temps, des sous-groupes de l’Armée de résistance du Seigneur sont devenus plus actifs dans la province du Haut-Uélé, et on a observé une recrudescence des incidents attribués à ce groupe armé au cours de la seconde moitié du mois de janvier.
5. Le 15 décembre, les FARDC ont arrêté le porte-parole et le responsable adjoint du renseignement des Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR), lesquels, selon les médias, ont été extradés vers le Rwanda en janvier. Bien qu’affaiblies par l’extradition et le rapatriement de combattants désarmés, les FDLR sont demeurées actives. Les 16 et 17 décembre, sept soldats des FARDC auraient été tués dans deux attaques distinctes par des individus présumés être des rebelles des FDLR. Les opérations militaires menées en décembre et en janvier contre un groupe dissident des FDLR, le Conseil national pour le renouveau et la démocratie-Ubwiyunge, ont forcé ce dernier à abandonner ses positions du Nord-Kivu et à s’installer dans le Sud-Kivu.
6. Au Burundi, la situation en matière de sécurité a été caractérisée par le maintien d’un calme relatif en dépit d’une certaine imprévisibilité et d’incidents isolés. Le 4 septembre, des individus armés non identifiés ont lancé une attaque dans la zone de la colline de Nkurubuye, dans la province de Ruyigi, le long de la frontière entre le Burundi et la République-Unie de Tanzanie. Le 19 octobre, des éléments présumés appartenir au groupe armé burundais Résistance pour un état de droit au Burundi (RED Tabara) ont attaqué une position de l’armée dans la province de Bubanza. Les forces armées burundaises ont capturé deux des assaillants, tandis que les autres se seraient enfuis en République démocratique du Congo.
7. En République centrafricaine, les conditions de sécurité demeurent précaires. Le 15 novembre, l’Union pour la paix en Centrafrique, un groupe armé affilié à l’ex-Séléka, ainsi que des civils armés, ont attaqué le camp de personnes déplacées d’Alindao. Entre 70 et 100 des quelque 18 000 civils hébergés dans le camp ont été tués. En outre, certains groupes armés ont continué d’acquérir des armes et des munitions auprès de pays voisins, comme l’a indiqué le Groupe d’experts sur la République centrafricaine dans son rapport paru sous la coteS/2018/1119.
8. Au Soudan du Sud, les combats sporadiques entre les Forces sud-soudanaises de défense du peuple et les forces d’opposition, ainsi qu’entre les groupes d’opposition, ont continué. Des violences entre différentes communautés et au sein d’une même communauté, qui ont fait des victimes parmi les civils et entraîné des déplacements, ont également été signalées.
9. Des atteintes à la sécurité transfrontalières ont été signalées dans les zones situées entre le Burundi, la République démocratique du Congo et le Rwanda, ce qui a contribué à accroître les tensions entre le Burundi et le Rwanda. Le 15 septembre, des éléments présumés appartenir aux Forces nationales de libération (FNL) seraient entrés au Burundi depuis le Sud-Kivu pour attaquer un poste frontière à Gatumba. Le 19 septembre, un dirigeant local de l’aile jeunesse du parti au pouvoir, Imbonerakure, a été tué avec son épouse près de la frontière avec le Rwanda, au cours d’une attaque que le ministère de la Sécurité publique du Burundi a attribué à un groupe armé rwandais. Le 7 octobre, des éléments armés non identifiés provenant apparemment du Rwanda ont tué trois civils dans la province de Cibitoke au Burundi. En octobre également, il y aurait eu des affrontements entre les FARDC et le FNL au Sud-Kivu. En outre, la Force de défense nationale du Burundi serait entrée au Sud-Kivu entre novembre et janvier, à la poursuite d’éléments armés burundais. Des affrontements meurtriers ont également été signalés entre la Force de défense nationale du Burundi, soutenue par Imbonerakure, et RED Tabara, ainsi que les FNL.
10. Des groupes armés ont également organisé des attaques visant le Rwanda. Le 10 décembre, les Forces combattantes abacunguzi ont effectué une incursion transfrontalière dans le village de Busesamana, dans le district de Rubavu au Rwanda, et tué au moins trois soldats, selon le Gouvernement rwandais. Le 15 décembre, des attaquants armés non identifiés, qui proviendraient du Burundi, ont lancé une attaque dans le secteur de Kitabi, dans le sud du Rwanda, mettant le feu à trois véhicules de transport de passagers et tuant deux civils. Selon le porte-parole militaire du Rwanda, trois des attaquants ont été tués et les autres ont fui au Burundi.
11. Le Groupe d’experts sur la République démocratique du Congo a signalé la présence d’une coalition armée connue sous le nom de « P5 », associée à des groupes d’opposition rwandais et active au Sud-Kivu, et qui aurait reçu des armes et munitions en provenance du Burundi.
12. En septembre, le mécanisme de suivi pour le rapatriement des combattants désarmés, qui a commencé ses activités le 24 avril 2018, a facilité le rapatriement vers le Rwanda de 11 combattants désarmés des FDLR depuis le camp de transit de Walungu dans le Sud-Kivu. En novembre, 52 autres combattants désarmés des FDLR, ainsi que les personnes à leur charge, se sont portés volontaires pour être rapatriés, ce qui a porté le nombre total de combattants désarmés des FDLR rapatriés dans le cadre du mécanisme de suivi depuis avril 2018 à 98.
13. Entre le 20 et le 27 novembre, les autorités congolaises, dans le cadre d’arrangements bilatéraux avec le Gouvernement rwandais, ont rapatrié 1 392 combattants désarmés des FDLR ainsi que les personnes à leur charge, après la fermeture des camps de transit de Kanyobagonga, Kisangani et Walungu, dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo. En outre, 242 éléments des FDLR précédemment détenus dans la prison d’Angenga, dans la province de l’Équateur, ont été remis au Rwanda. Tous les combattants désarmés ont été transférés au camp de démobilisation et de réintégration de Mutobo au Rwanda.
14. Autre évolution positive, en octobre, la coopération entre le Gouvernement de la République démocratique du Congo et la MONUSCO a abouti au transfert hors des locaux de la MONUSCO des 51 membres restants du Mouvement/Armée populaire de libération du Soudan dans l’opposition, qui étaient sous la garde de la Mission depuis août 2016.

Title: Machen sich deutsche Politiker der "psychischen Beihilfe" schuldig, wenn sie die YPG oder die Opposition in Venezuela loben? | Telepolis
Dr. Ignace Murwanashyaka.Foto:CC BY 2.0
Die Murwanashyaka-Urteilsbegründung des BGH könnte dafür sorgen, dass sich der Generalbundesanwalt, der in der Tendenz allen nichtstaatlichen Kombattanten terroristischen Charakter zuordnet, mehr mit den Einzelfällen befassen muss
Heute veröffentlichte der Bundesgerichtshof (BGH) die schriftliche Begründung seines bereits am 20. Dezember gefällten Urteils gegen Dr. Ignace Murwanashyaka, den ehemaligen Präsidenten der im Ostkongo aktiven exilruandischen Hutu-Organisation FDLR (Aktenzeichen 3 StR 236/17).
Zur FDLR, der der vor 19 Jahren in Deutschland als asylberechtigt anerkannte Murwanashyaka von 2001 bis zu seiner Festnahme 2009 als Präsident vorstand, gehört auch die Miliz FOCA. Sie entstand aus der 1994 von der Tutsi-"Rebellengruppe" RPF vertriebenen Hutu-dominierten ruandischen Armee FAR und den mit ihnen verbündeten Interahamwe-Milizen. Im Ostkongo, wo sie sich formierte, arbeitete sie anfangs mit der Armee von Laurent Kabila zusammen, dem ehemaligen Präsidenten des Kongo. Gemeinsam bekämpften die beiden Truppen damals die auch im Nachbarland aktive neue Tutsi-dominierte Armee Ruandas. Plünderungen und andere Kriegsverbrechen beging die FOCA-Miliz Medienberichten nach schon damals.
2008 änderte sich die Situation, weil sich Laurent Kabilas Sohn und Nachfolger Joseph Kabila mit dem ruandischen Präsidenten Paul Kagame verbündete - einem Tutsi, der die Hutu-Miliz nun auch auf dem Staatsgebiet des Kongo offiziell bekämpfte durfte. Von da an war die FDLR nicht mehr Verbündete einer anerkannten Staatsmacht, sondern deren Feind. Damit konnten ihre Plünderungen, Vergewaltigungen und Morde an Zivilisten als Verbrechen einer ausländischen terroristischen Organisation nach dem 2002 eingeführten deutschen Strafrechtsparagrafen 129b gewertet werden.
Murwanashyaka hielt sich zwar vor dem Bruch zwischen Joseph Kabila und der FDLR im Kongo auf, aber nicht mehr danach. Damit er trotzdem nicht nur als Rädelsführer angeklagt werden konnte, beschuldigte man ihn, der FDLR Beihilfe zu Kriegsverbrechen geleistet zu haben: Durch den Kauf von Zubehör für Satellitentelefone und durch "psychische" Unterstützung über Reden und Stellungnahmen gegenüber ausländischen Medien. Das Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart verurteilte ihn deshalb 2015 zu 13 Jahren Haft.
Das OLG muss den Prozess nach diesem Urteil des BGH bzgl. dieser Unterstützungshandlungen wiederholen, weil es bei der Einstufung Murwanashyakas als Beihelfer mehrere Fehler machte. So ging es zum Beispiel davon aus, dass die vom damaligen FDLR-Präsidenten gekauften Telefonkarten der Organisation der Miliz dienten und damit mittelbar nützlich waren, um Angriffe auf Dörfer im Ostkongo zu koordinieren. Das genügte dem Senat nicht, weil der unmittelbare Bezug zu diesen Angriffen fehlte.
Hinsichtlich der vorgeworfenen psychischen Beihilfe kommt der 3. Strafsenat ebenso zum Ergebnis, dass "eine auf Dementierung oder Bagatellisierung gerichtete Propagandatätigkeit" und "motivierende Botschaften" konkrete Auswirkung auf die einzelne Tat haben müssen. Hier kam der BGH zum Ergebnis, dass eine Bestärkung, konkret verhandelte Kriegsverbrechen in vier Ortschaften zu begehen, "nicht rechtsfehlerfrei festgestellt" wurde.
"Die im Rahmen der rechtlichen Würdigung angeführte generelle Steigerung von 'Moral' und 'Kampfkraft" der Milizionäre" genügt ihm dabei ebenso wenig wie "die Feststellung, durch die Propagandatätigkeit sei bei diesen 'der Eindruck' hervorgerufen worden, die FDLR habe nicht nur Gegner". "Für eine […] hierdurch vermittelte, den jeweiligen Willen zur Tatbegehung beeinflussende Überzeugung, 'keine konkreten Konsequenzen' wegen dieser von FOCA-Führungskräften angeordneten Taten befürchten zu müssen", fehlt dem Urteil des 3. Strafsenats nach "jeder Beleg".
Bezieht man eine andere BGH-Entscheidung mit ein (auf die der Senat bereits im Leitsatz verweist), stuft der Bundesgerichtshof die FDLR indirekt als Organisation mit anderer Zielsetzung ein als die SS: Deren Vernichtungsziel sah er 2016 als so im Vordergrund stehend an, dass er in seiner Groening-Entscheidung (3 StR 49/16) jegliches Tätigwerden in der Vernichtungslagerverwaltung als ausreichend wertete, um sich der Beihilfe zu Mord schuldig zu machen.
Mittelbar könnte diese differenzierte Sichtweise auch auf die Urteilsbegründung im NSU-Verfahren Bedeutung haben: Das Oberlandesgericht München hat zumindest in der mündlichen Urteilsbegründung wegen der überragenden Bedeutung der Angeklagten Zschäpe für die Vereinigung Mittäterschaft angenommen, auch wenn ein konkreter Nachweis von deren Mitwirkung bei den einzelnen Taten gerade nicht möglich war. Die Präsidentenstellung allein reichte dem 3. Strafsenat bei Dr. Murwanashyaka nach den bisherigen Feststellungen des Oberlandesgerichts Stuttgart aber nicht.
Dass der BGH bei der Betrachtung einer "terroristischen Vereinigung" eine stärkere Differenzierung einfordert, zeigt auch die sehr ausführliche Sachverhaltsdarstellung in der Begründung des Murwanashyaka-Urteils. Der Generalbundesanwalt, der in der Tendenz allen nichtstaatlichen Kombattanten terroristischen Charakter zuordnet (was dazu führt, dass beispielsweise in Syrien alle Bürgerkriegsakteure außer der Armee und ihren Verbündeten terroristische Vereinigungen sind), muss sich deshalb künftig möglicherweise mehr mit den jeweiligen Einzelfällen befassen. Sonst könnte es sein, dass sich auch Mitglieder der Bundesregierung plötzlich mit dem Vorwurf der psychischen Beihilfe konfrontiert sehen, wenn sie beispielsweise die kurdische YPG loben oder sich zugunsten der Opposition in Venezuela aussprechen.

Title: Uganda Calls for Coordinated Action Against Militants
By Halima Athumani March 08, 2019
Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, has called for more coordinated action to deal with militants in Africa's Great Lakes region. Meanwhile, the United Nations has urged countries to address the root causes of conflicts in the region that have created over 4 million refugees and displaced millions more.
At a Great Lakes security conference Thursday in Kampala, Museveni said he wanted more active cooperation in confronting the region's militants.
"Like the problem of Eastern Congo, I'm sure, if the countries of this area acted together, that problem could be solved. It's not such a big problem. Even the problem of Somalia, if it was not for this theater in which we are engaged, we could solve that problem by having enough action," Museveni said.
Uganda has deployed more than 6,000 troops to Somalia under the African Union Mission to fight the al-Shabab terrorist group.
Meanwhile, conflict in Great Lakes countries like Burundi, the Central African Republic and South Sudan has created over 4 million refugees in recent years and displaced millions more.
Uganda has been praised for hosting an estimated 1.1 million refugees – the largest number for any country in Africa. However, Uganda's minister for relief and refugees, Hillary Onek, warned that the country would not be exploited.
"We shall continue to be hospitable, but we should not be used by other people to solve their problems. Refugees have come, we shall look after them. And when your country is peaceful, they can return. But people want to exploit the situation to become refugees but, whereas they don't really have problems in their country, so, they want to use our hospitality for wrong reasons," she said.
Speaking at the conference Thursday, United Nations Special Envoy Said Djinnit urged the Great Lakes countries to address the root cause of conflicts in the region.
Djinnit blamed conflict over land, resources, corruption and poor governance for fueling the fighting. He cited Uganda's repatriation of 57 former M23 rebels to the Democratic Republic of Congo as an example of cross-border cooperation to help end conflict.
"When there's determination, we brought together the leaders of the countries, they took the decision, they established the mechanism and, therefore, relieved this country from this burden," he said. "And remove that problem between Uganda and the DRC. Because as long as the M23 are in Uganda, there is still that impression that [they] may have some kind of support in Uganda."
The M23 fighters crossed into Uganda in 2013 after intense fighting with DRC-backed U.N. forces.

Allied Democratic Forces Allegiance to Islamic State Poses Major Threat, Democratic Republic of Congo’s Permanent Representative Warns
Progress can be made on even the most protracted issues when national leaders of Africa’s Great Lakes demonstrate political will, the United Nations Special Envoy for that region told the Security Council today as it discussed the presence of armed groups, the refugee crisis and the illicit exploitation of and trafficking in natural resources, among other persistent challenges.
“Indeed, since the 1990s and early 2000s, the region has made important steps towards durable peace and stability,” Said Djinnit, Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, told members in his final briefing in that capacity.  Despite persisting insecurity in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in the Central African Republic and South Sudan, “the region today is largely peaceful”, he said.
“Where cross-border clashes frequently occurred, differences between member States are now mostly addressed through dialogue, albeit not always conclusively,” he continued, while sounding the alarm over the continued presence of negative forces in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which perpetuates insecurity and mistrust between some countries.
Allegations of support for such groups by regional Governments or their proxies, and claims of cross-border interference, continue to threaten cordial relations and stability, he pointed out.  They are compounded by the continuing illegal trade in natural resources, he added, urging sustained regional and global attention to these issues.
The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo highlighted regional efforts to eradicate armed groups, citing the ferocity of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which threatens the United Nations peacekeeping mission in that country and recruits from countries in the region.  ADF also has an international recruitment network and demonstrates a tendency towards fundamentalism, he said, urging the Council to focus more closely on that issue since ADF has sworn allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) since October 2017, and receives financing for its activities in his country.
He went on to point out that the Secretary-General’s report also mentions the P5 armed group, which is active in South Kivu Province and associated with Rwandan opposition groups.  It receives ammunition and weapons from a neighbouring country, he said, urging the Council’s Panel of Experts to shine a light on the supply circuit and on those violating the arms embargo, and for regional efforts to implement the Framework Agreement.
Council members expressed mixed views on the progress made and the remaining challenges.  The Russian Federation’s representative said that full implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, adopted in 2013, will have a favourable impact on an otherwise tense situation in the region.
Belgium’s representative said that, despite the Special Envoy’s excellent efforts, the overall situation remains complex, characterized by a growing number of cross-border incidents, particularly on the borders of Burundi, but also between Rwanda and Uganda.  Eliminating the threat posed by certain negative forces will require strong political engagement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and others, he stressed.
China’s representative cited the positive political and security developments, notably the signing of the Revitalized Peace Agreement in South Sudan, the elections held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the continuing stabilization of the situation in Burundi — all of which demonstrate that regional cooperation among countries can lead to African solutions to African problems.  It is also imperative to address poverty and underdevelopment as causes of conflict, he emphasized, calling for increased official development assistance (ODA) and the scaling up of investment in health.
Equatorial Guinea’s representative said that the responsibility of building an Africa free of conflict falls on the continent’s States, as well as civil society and the institutions of the African Union.  However, the destabilizing activities of armed groups, as well as intercommunal conflict expose civilians to malnutrition and disease, she noted, calling upon the African Union, the International Organization of La Francophonie and other entities to build synergies with the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to implement the Framework Agreement and foster regional good-neighbourliness while bolstering the fight against armed groups and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.
Also speaking today were representatives of the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Poland, Peru, Germany, Côte d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Kuwait and France.
The meeting began at 3:28 p.m. and ended at 5:23 p.m.
Briefing
SAID DJINNIT, Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, said that his office facilitated the voluntary repatriation of 98 former combatants of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and their dependents from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Rwanda.  Also, former elements of the 23 March Movement (M23) and their dependents, as well as one former M23 fighter from Rwanda were returned from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Uganda.  In November 2018, all FDLR camps in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo were closed by the Congolese authorities with 1,634 disarmed FDLR combatants and dependents were repatriated to Rwanda through bilateral agreements, he said.  “This shows that progress can be made even on the most protracted issue when political will is displayed by the leaders of the region,” he said, urging the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda to conclude the repatriation of remaining ex‑M23 members living in camps within their respective territories.
Noting the need to strengthen existing security and confidence‑building mechanisms, he said that his office is working closely with the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to help operationalize the Joint Follow-up Mechanism on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism as important platforms for exchanging information and enhancing regional cooperation to neutralize negative forces.  There is also urgent need to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region, since more than 4 million of the 6.3 million refugees in Africa originate in the Great Lakes region, he pointed out.  The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region was asked to develop a regional strategy and action plan to find durable solutions, he said, pointing out that today’s briefing is his last as Special Envoy.  He went on to outline progress and challenges, recalling that the region has made important steps towards durable peace and stability since the 1990s and early 2000s.
Despite persisting insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan, the region is largely peaceful today, he continued.  “Where cross‑border clashes frequently occurred, differences between member States are now mostly addressed through dialogue, albeit not always conclusively,” he added.  However, the continued presence of negative forces in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo perpetuates insecurity and mistrust between some countries, he said, noting that allegations of support for such groups by Governments in the region or their proxies, and claims of cross‑border interference continue to threaten cordial relations and stability.  They are compounded by the continuing illegal exploitation of and trade in natural resources, he said, underlining that such issues require sustained attention.
He went on to recall that he focused on several key priority areas during his tenure, including the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework signed on 24 February 2013, which sought to strengthen regional ownership of the implementation process.  He also sought to maintain regional and international focus on the need to strengthen cooperation against negative forces.  He helped to maintain regional cohesion and to focus international attention on the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, while situating women’s participation in peace and political processes at the centre of his advocacy efforts.  He said that he also encouraged a political conversation on ways to transform natural resources into a vehicle of shared prosperity while promoting the rule of law and ensuring respect for human rights.
Statements
DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation), noting the progress made in implementing the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, called upon its signatories to uphold all their obligations.  Full implementation will have a favourable impact on an otherwise tense situation in the region, he said, expressing hope that the new Special Envoy will be able to accelerate efforts in that regard.  Concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he noted that the successful elections have yet to yield tangible improvement in the country’s security and socioeconomic situation.  He went on to emphasize the need for cross‑border cooperation to prevent the spread of Ebola while saying he shares the Secretary‑General’s concern about the complex humanitarian situation, despite positive developments regarding refugees.  He concluded by expressing hope that ongoing differences between regional leaders will not erode their commitment to the Framework.
JONATHAN R. COHEN (United States) said the Framework is every bit as relevant today as it was when introduced in 2013.  Indeed, it may even have new importance.  Welcoming announcements by the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on security sector reform, consolidation of State authority and economic development, he said now is the time for regional leaders to live up to their commitments, adhere to the principles of non‑interference and deny safe harbour to armed groups.  Recalling rising tensions described by Council members during past meetings, he emphasized that the people of the Great Lakes region have a remarkable opportunity for peace that must be seized and supported.
MARC PECSTEEN DE BUYTSWERVE (Belgium) said that, despite the Special Envoy’s excellent efforts, the overall situation remains complex, with a growing number of cross‑border incidents, particularly on the borders of Burundi, but also between Rwanda and Uganda.  Eliminating the threat of certain negative forces will require strong political engagement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and others, he noted.  Welcoming the peace agreement signed in the Central African Republic, he expressed hope that upcoming elections in Burundi will be credible, transparent and inclusive.  Turning to the humanitarian situation, he said the overall picture is sombre, with more than 11 million people forcibly displaced, and called for vigilance in relation to the Ebola outbreak.  He also expressed regret that the Secretary‑General’s report does not sufficiently address the human rights situation, suggesting that more thought be given to how the Framework can improve cross‑border investment.
STEPHEN HICKEY (United Kingdom), welcoming the Special Envoy’s efforts for the voluntary repatriation of fighters from Rwanda, and of M23 fighters from Uganda, agreed that there is need to tackle the exploitation of natural resources, particularly by armed groups.  Commending the Congolese people’s exercise of their democratic right to vote, he called upon all stakeholders to remain focused on creating a more inclusive political process.  He also welcomed efforts to implement the peace and reconciliation agreement in the Central African Republic, while noting that an inclusive dialogue in Burundi will be a precursor to credible elections in that country.  All stakeholders should continue to support efforts by the East African Community to end the political crisis in Burundi, he emphasized, outlining his delegation’s wish to see that country engage further with regional Heads of State and Government.
Ms. MCBRIDE (South Africa) encouraged Governments to complete the repatriation of former M23 combatants, in accordance with international refugee law, pointing out that armed groups threaten regional stability and integration.  Expressing support for the extension of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (MONUSCO) mandate as part of efforts to deliver greater stability to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the wider region, she emphasized that the Government must assert its authority throughout the national territory, while focusing on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.  The international community should help the newly inaugurated Government and embolden its institutions, she said.  More broadly, she expressed support for the inter‑Burundi dialogue, notably the East African Community’s facilitation process, commending the efforts of the mediator and the former facilitator.  She said the global ceasefire agreement and the Arusha Accords should be read together in the quest for a lasting solution to the impasse, and pressed the Council to reaffirm calls for all signatories to the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework to ensure long‑term peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the wider region.
JOANNA WRONECKA (Poland) emphasized that reform of the justice and penitentiary systems is vital, welcoming the announcement that a justice and good governance event will be held in Nairobi in May.  Stressing that the peace and security Framework is essential to regional peace, she called upon all signatories to fulfil their commitments promptly.  Poland welcomes efforts by the African Union and other organizations to strengthen the peace and security Framework, she said, stressing that the regional dimension of the Great Lakes crisis must not be overlooked.
GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru), voicing concern over ongoing violence in the region, stressed the importance of the Framework Agreement in achieving sustainable peace.  Emphasizing the value of a regional approach, he pointed to the importance of shared spaces for dialogue leading to confidence‑building, greater economic integration and stronger institutions.  The humanitarian situation remains a cause for concern, however, with an alarming number of people in need of food assistance.  Hopefully, the international community and those countries committed to regional peace and stability will continue to provide adequate and sustainable financing, he said.
JUERGEN SCHULZ (Germany) said many threats to peace and stability remain, rooted in unresolved political crises, a volatile security situation and regional tensions.  It is critical that the new President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo implement the political and economic reforms that he has announced.  Condemning attacks on Ebola treatment centres, he said the politicization of the Ebola crisis must be prevented.  Emphasizing the need for political will among the region’s leaders, he expressed concern over the activities of armed groups and cross‑border incidents as well as the deterioration in relations between Uganda and Rwanda and called on all sides to refrain from violence and proxy conflict.  On human rights, he voiced concern over shrinking political space and the violation of political freedoms.  Protection of children in conflict must be a priority, he added.
AMPARO MELE COLIFA (Equatorial Guinea), emphasizing the principle of “African solutions to African problems”, said building an Africa that is free of conflict is a responsibility that falls on its States, civil society and the institutions of the African Union.  Respect for sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity is the basis for stability and development and must be considered.  She welcomed support from the international community and called on all parties directly involved to put confidence‑building measures into place.  She hailed the measures taken by Governments in the region to respond to the humanitarian situation, warning however that the destabilizing activities of armed groups and intercommunal conflict expose civilians to malnutrition and disease.  International efforts should focus on providing funds to updated humanitarian response plans.  She called on the African Union, International Organization of la Francophonie and others to build synergies with the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to implement the Framework Agreement and foster regional good neighbourliness while bolstering the fight against armed groups and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.
WU HAITAO (China) cited positive political and security developments in the Great Lakes region, notably the signing of a revitalized peace agreement in South Sudan by major political parties, elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a situation in Burundi that continues to stabilize — all of which demonstrate that countries can find African solutions to African problems through regional cooperation.  The international community should help safeguard regional peace and stability, by demonstrating respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and country ownership of issues affecting them without interference.  Regional and subregional organizations, meanwhile, should continue to take on a mediation role, while the United Nations should provide support for conflict prevention, mediation peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  Further, the international community should strengthen communication with regional countries, provide assistance according to their requirements and help them in such areas as natural resource management and border control.  It is also imperative to address poverty and underdevelopment as causes of conflict, he said, calling for increased official development assistance (ODA) and scaled up investment in health.
TIEMOKO MORIKO (Côte d’Ivoire) welcomed that the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo led to the peaceful holding of elections in December 2018 and called for building on those gains.  Welcoming the 5 February signing of the peace accord in Sudan, he went on to urge stakeholders in the Central African Republic to meet the aspirations of the country’s people.  In Burundi, he welcomed the President’s decision to not run in the 2020 elections, calling on the Government, opposition and people to end the political crisis there.  More broadly, he said challenges in the Great Lakes region include illegal armed groups operating in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the latter also challenged by intercommunal violence and a resurgence of Ebola.  Greater bilateral and regional cooperation will help alleviate those threats, he said, endorsing the recommendation by the ninth high‑level meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism to end the destabilizing activities of armed groups.  Noting that the Addis Ababa framework allows for addressing the structural causes of instability, he called for greater support to States in the Great Lakes region for implementing it.
MUHSIN SYIHAB (Indonesia) said that the Great Lakes region has been marred with conflict, distrust and humanitarian difficulties for years, stressing the need to tackle the root causes of such sufferings, including illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources and the lack of development.  At the end of 2018, about 11.2 million people in the region remained forcibly displaced.  More than 22.7 million people needed food assistance, but the funding for humanitarian responses in 2018 was less than 50 per cent.  The work of regional organizations and United Nations missions should be supported by the Council as they play a crucial role.  Addressing the complex peace and security challenges in the region is not easy, he said, urging greater efforts to reach peace and stability.
JOSÉ MANUEL TRULLOLS (Dominican Republic) stressed the role of the African Union and other regional or subregional organizations in the quest for peaceful and stable coexistence in the region.  Noting with concern the delicate security situation, especially in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, he called upon affected countries to work jointly to dismantle armed groups and invest in development.  He also called for more funding of the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak, and for international, regional and national bodies to redouble their efforts to bring the perpetrators of human rights violations to justice.
BADER ABDULLAH N. M. ALMUNAYEKH (Kuwait) called upon States in the region to strengthen cooperation in responding to security challenges and to the illicit exploitation of and trafficking in natural resources.  Describing the deteriorating security and humanitarian situations, including the Ebola outbreak, as a growing burden for the region, he stressed that the challenges faced by the Great Lakes region must be considered in a comprehensive fashion covering security, political, humanitarian and development aspects.
FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France), Council President for March, spoke in his national capacity, saying the time is ripe, at the end of the Special Envoy’s mandate, to take stock of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done.  Six years after the adoption of the Addis Ababa framework, strong political will can be seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which should set an example for others to follow since that country’s destiny and those of its neighbours are interlinked, he noted.  While the Framework Agreement is key for building trust, working together requires high‑quality dialogue among all stakeholders, he added.  Expressing hope that the new Special Envoy will ensure that dialogue continues, he said France shares the Secretary‑General’s concern about tensions between some signatories to the Framework Agreement, which are exacerbated by the threat posed by armed groups and the harm created by the illegal exploitation of and trafficking in natural resources.
IGNACE GATA MAVITA WA LUFUTA (Democratic Republic of the Congo), calling attention to regional efforts to eradicate armed groups, uphold agreements and work towards harmony, noted that the Secretary‑General’s report describes the ferocity of ADF in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it threatens MONUSCO while recruiting from other countries in the region.  Also, the midterm report of the Panel of Experts (documentS/2018/1133) notes ADF’s international recruitment network and tendency towards fundamentalism.  He urged the Council to focus more keenly on that issue, since ADF has sworn allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) since October 2017 and receives financing for its activities in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The group’s blocking of the response to Ebola further undermines stability in the region, he said.
Calling for a review of the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC) and MONUSCO strategies for securing the eastern part of the country, he noted that the Secretary‑General’s report also mentions the “P5” armed group, which is active in South Kivu Province and associated with Rwandan opposition groups.  It receives ammunition and weapons from a neighbouring country, he added, cautioning that the group could potentially pull his country into another armed conflict.  He urged the Panel of Experts to shed light on the supply circuit and on those violating the arms embargo.  Emphasizing the intention of his country’s Government to prioritize the consolidation of regional peace, with a focus on good neighbourliness, he said that its humanitarian efforts in responding to people’s needs should be supported.
He underscored the President’s commitment to the rule of law and determination to humanize the security services, fight abuse and foster media access.  He also cited the release of political prisoners and the steps taken to fight both corruption and human trafficking.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo has always upheld its commitments under the Framework Agreement and will do its part to foster peace, he said, adding that it respects all resolutions adopted during the ninth high‑level meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism aimed at neutralizing destabilizing forces.  It also deplores the lack of involvement by other regional States in the harmonious functioning of the Joint Follow‑up Mechanism on ADF, he said, asking the guarantors of the Framework Agreement to make the most of the Mechanism’s tenth high‑level meeting, to be held in October 2019.

Title: UN-Einsatz im Kongo: "Es gibt Fortschritte" – DW – 27.03.2019
An diesem Mittwoch stimmt der UN-Sicherheitsrat über die Verlängerung der UN-Mission im Kongo ab. Ihr Mandat läuft am Monatsende aus. Im DW-Interview zieht Missionsleiterin Leila Zerrougui eine Bilanz des Einsatzes.
DW: Frau Zerrougui, in diesem Jahr werden es 20 Jahre sein, dass dieMONUSCO- vormals MONUC - in der Demokratischen Republik Kongo ist. Was hat sich in den letzten 20 Jahren im Hinblick auf die Sicherheit wirklich verändert - insbesondere für die Bevölkerung im Osten des Landes?
Leila Zerrougui: Viele Dinge. Wir befinden wir uns jetzt in einem Land, das trotz aller Schwierigkeiten vereint ist. Zwar gibt es immer noch bewaffnete Gruppen in mindestens sechs der 26 Provinzen. Aber niemand besetzt mehr Gebiete, die die nationale Armee nicht durchdringen kann. Es gibt enorme Herausforderungen in Bezug auf die Professionalisierung von Armee und der Polizei, die hoheitlichen Aufgaben des Staates und in Bezug auf die Grenzkontrollen. Aber es gibt Fortschritte. Die sind auch all den Bemühungen der Internationalen Gemeinschaft zu verdanken.
Aber wenn Sie zum Beispiel den Menschen in der Stadt  Beni sagen, dass sich die Situation stark verbessert hat, werden sie lachen  oder vielmehr weinen, weil es immer noch regelmäßige Angriffe der ADF-Miliz gibt. Was sagen die Ihnen? Wie reagieren sie?
Die Region Beni ist das Gebiet, in dem fast 70 Prozent unserer Truppen eingesetzt wurden. Wir haben dort unsere Spezialeinheit FIB. Wir haben dort viel Personal im Einsatz, denn es ist ein Gebiet, das unseren Schutz braucht. Wenn ich sage, es gibt Fortschritte, dann spreche ich von einem Gebiet von 2,5 Millionen Quadratkilometern.
Sie sprechen von der FIB, der schnellen Eingreiftruppe, die 2013 aufgestellt wurde und im gleichen Jahr mit dem Sieg über die M23-Miliz einen spektakulären Erfolg hatte. Seitdem hören wir nicht mehr viel von ihr...
Und dennoch war die Zahl dergetöteten Soldatenim Jahr 2017 am größten(15 tansanische Blauhelme wurden im Dezember 2017 getötet; bei einem Angriff 2018 starben ein Tansanier und sieben Malawier, Anm. d. Red.). Es war schwer für mich, ihren Familien in Tansania und in Malawi zu begegnen. Friedenstruppen, die gezwungen sind, Krieg zu führen, obwohl sie doch Frieden bringen sollen. Es ist viel komplizierter, als man denkt...
Frau Zerrougui, Sie haben über die Fortschritte des Landes gesprochen, aber Sie haben auch Gebiete erwähnt, in denen es zu Gewalt gekommen ist. Da warKasai, da war Tanganyika, Ituri. Sind die Bedingungen denn günstig für einen Abzug der MONUSCO?
Viele bewaffnete Gruppen ergeben sich. Die heutige Herausforderung lautet: Werden wir über die Mittel verfügen, um sie aufzunehmen und für sie aufzukommen? Wir haben dieses Phänomen auch in Ituri mit der FRPI, wir haben dieses Phänomen auch in Tanganyika. Es gibt Hoffnung. Aber das wird nicht mal eben in zwei Monaten zu machen sein.
Also wird die Mission nicht sofort abgezogen? Bei all der zu leistenden Arbeit, der Ausbildung der kongolesischen Armee, die Sie erwähnt haben. Die Mission wird etwas länger dauern?
Der Präsident der Republik(Félix Tshisékédi, Anm. d. Red.)sagte: Geben Sie mir etwas Zeit, um Prioritäten zu benennen, und bereiten Sie das Ende der UN-Mission vor. Niemand, weder der ehemalige Präsident(Joseph Kabila, Anm. d. Red.)noch der jetzige, bittet darum, dass dieMONUSCOfür immer bleibt. Und ich glaube nicht, dass diejenigen, die über unser Mandat entscheiden, diese Absicht haben.
Die ADF ist ein schwieriger Feind, eine schwer zu bekämpfende Miliz. Wäre ein Dialog mit ihr wünschenswert - und wäre er überhaupt möglich? Schließlich handelt es sich nicht um eine einheitliche Struktur, sondern um eine verstreut agierende Miliz.
Es ist keine Miliz - es ist eine bewaffnete Gruppe, die sich in den 1980er-Jahren in der Demokratischen Republik Kongo niedergelassen hat.(Ex-Präsident, Anm. d. Red.)Mobutu hatte ihnen dieses Gebiet gegeben. So sind sie der Meinung, dass es ihnen gehört.
Und sie vermischen sich auch mit der Bevölkerung.......
Natürlich, es gibt ja Ehen, und es gibt wirtschaftliche Aspekte. Sie verkaufen Gold und Holz an die Nachbarländer. Wir sollten natürlich darauf achten, dass sie nicht zu einer bewaffneten Gruppe werden, die eine zunehmend internationale Dimension haben könnte.
Ich glaube nicht, dass Probleme durch Waffen allein gelöst werden. Natürlich werden wir sie nicht an eine Wand stellen und erschießen. Es gibt Kinder und Frauen unter ihnen. Werden wir sie töten? Wir müssen Anstrengungen unternehmen, um uns um sie zu kümmern, sie zu integrieren. Es gibt immer eine soziale Dimension, eine politische Dimension, eine Dimension, die es uns ermöglicht, das Blatt zu wenden. Ansonsten wird sich nichts ändern und die Instabilität wird anhalten.
Leila Zerrougui ist seit Anfang 2018 die Sonderbeauftragte des Generalsekretärs der Vereinten Nationen für die Demokratische Republik Kongo und damit die Leiterin derMONUSCO(Stabilisierungsmission der Vereinten Nationen in der Demokratischen Republik Kongo) Die algerische Juristin war zuvor u.a. Vorsitzende des UN-Menschenrechtsrats und Sonderbeauftragte für Kinder in bewaffneten Konflikten.
Das Interview führten Dirke Köpp und Fréjus Quenum.

Title: WHO chief says much larger Ebola outbreak averted | CIDRAP
MONUSCO, Alain Coulibaly / Flickr cc
Today World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in a press conference on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), said, "We have averted a much larger outbreak, and we will not leave when the outbreak ends."
Tedros, who goes by his first name, said, "We will stay and work with communities and government to stay and provide services for all health needs. This is what the community is asking for."
The press conference came on the heels of Tedros's visit to the DRC last week with Robert Redfield, MD the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also comes on a day DRC officials added 5 new cases to the outbreak total and reported new acts of violence.
At the start of the visit, Tedros said he spoke with health workers in Butembo who were targeted by violence. Their commitment to staying and fighting the outbreak gave him hope that the people on the ground in the DRC will be able to end the outbreak, and he confirmed that security is the number one challenge facing health workers in the DRC.
Throughout the press conference, Tedros said the acts of violence and resistance are not coming from the community, but rather are being inflicted upon the community by rebel forces, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Mai Mai.
"We see more community cooperation and increasing acceptance," Tedros said; "87% of families agree to safe and dignified burials, and over 90% of people have accepted vaccination."
What the community has asked of the WHO, Tedros said, is support in building a health system after Ebola transmission ends. He pledged as much, saying, "Leaving the area is not an option, evacuation is not an option" for the WHO.
In contrast to recent remarks from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) International President Joanne Liu, MD, who said the strategies being used in the DRC were not adequate to end the outbreak, Tedros described signs the virus was on the retreat in DRC.
"There's half as many new cases per week now as there were in January," he said. January saw an average of 50 cases per week, which is now down to 25 cases per week.
Additionally, Tedros said the outbreak has been contained in 11 of 28 communities that have reported Ebola.
Today the DRC's ministry of health recorded five new Ebola cases, three in Mandima and one each in Kalunguta and Lubero. Three deaths were also recorded, including a community death in Mandima.
The cases bring the outbreak totals to 932, including 587 deaths. A total of 210 suspected cases are under investigation.
Also today, both the DRC and Tedros mentioned a new attack in Biena. A mob attacked Biena's General Reference Hospital and a local transit center, and all outbreak activities are stopped for at least today, the DRC said.
Finally the DRC updated its vaccination campaign totals: 87,985 people have been vaccinated since August with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, including 22,336 in Katwa, 20,849 in Beni, and 10,939 in Butembo.

Title: World’s Second-Worst Outbreak of Ebola Sweeps DRC Amid Islamist Attacks on Treatment Centers | The Epoch Times
Friends Read Free
The deadly Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has now exceeded 1,000 cases and claimed the lives of more than 600, the country’s health ministry confirmed on Monday, March 25.
But the situation has been made worse with attacks on treatment centers by militant Islamists in the region who have been entrenched in Eastern Congo’s 25-year-long civil war.
“The total is now 1,009 new cases,” Congolese health officials said in a statement. “But the response, led by the Health Ministry in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread.”
It is the second worst outbreak in history, surpassed only by the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,000 people, according to the U.N.’s World Health Organization (WHO).
“We use words like ‘cases’ and ’containment' to be scientific but behind every number is a person, a family and a community that is suffering,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general said in a statement on Saturday. “This outbreak has gone on far too long.”
Ebola is a deadly and contagious virus that spreads to people from wild animals and is transmitted among people through direct contact, such as through bodily fluids or broken skin. Over half of Ebola cases are fatal. The disease causes fever along with diarrhoea, severe vomiting, bleeding, and rashes.
But advancements in the treatment of the Ebola virus, such as a trial vaccine, experimental treatments, and mobile units for treating patients have meant that health workers have been better prepared for the latest outbreak.
The virus has been prevented from spreading into neighboring countries and there have been no reported Ebola cases outside of the DRC’s provinces Ituri and North Kivu, the U.N. health body confirmed on March 23.
Only 10 percent of those eligible for the vaccination have refused treatment, the WHO said, and more than 80 percent of those who become fatally infected accept arrangements to be made for safe and dignified burials—a key to preventing the spread of the disease that remains contagious for several days after death.
The WHO cited “increased security challenges, including the recent direct attacks on treatment centers, and pockets of community mistrust” as causes for the recent reported weekly rate of confirmed Ebola cases, following several weeks of decline.
According to WHO, of the 51 reported Ebola cases among health workers working in the region, 17 have died.
An attack on a treatment center earlier this month saw a local police officer killed, according to CNN.
“As we mourn the lives lost, we must also recognize that thousands of people have been protected from this terrifying disease,” Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement.
“We are working in exceptionally challenging circumstances but thanks to support from donors and the efforts of the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, we have saved thousands of lives.”
Ebola is endemic to the DRC. The first outbreak of the virus occured in 1976.

Title: The Rwandan Jewel - Peacekeepers, Conflict Minerals and Lots of Foreign Aid
Disrupting Geostrategic Thought
Since the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the small central African country has become a magnet for money and weapons. Its military played key roles in the 1st and 2nd Congo Wars and still supports rebels in the mineral-rich Kivu region of its neighbor to the west, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Rwanda’s military prowess is now essential to U.S. and United Nations international peacekeeping and counter-insurgency operations.Lima Charlie Worldexamined the support for a government which, by the account of most international organizations, deliberately benefits from the smuggling of conflict minerals.
Rwanda plays an enormous role in U.N. peacekeeping. Stunningly, Rwanda, a small country of 12 million with about 1% of the African continent’s population, is thethird largest troop contributor to the U.N.It is thelargest contributorto the U.N. Mission to South Sudan, and thelargest troop supplierfor the U.N.’s Central African Republic forces. Rwanda was also a major force in the U.N.’s farawayoperations in Haiti. The heroism of Rwanda’s soldiers in the U.N. is celebrated in the Rwandan press, often inbreathless terms.
This is an astonishing turnaround for a country that suffered what was arguably one of the biggest failures of the U.N., the 1994 genocide, a 100 day period in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. For sending its soldiers to participate in international peacekeeping operations in 2012 — “peacekeeping operations” being armies composed of armed multinational soldiers that provide security to guarantee ceasefires — the small central African country received payments from abroad equivalent to 70% of its military budget, according toNina Wilén, Research Director at the Royal Institute for International Relations in Belgium. Since 2012, Rwanda’s military budgethas doubled, and the number of Rwandan troops participating in U.N. peacekeeping hasincreased by around 40%.
Geographically, the country is right next to the U.N.’s largest peacekeeping operation. Over 15,000 U.N. troops have been deployed to the DRC, ostensibly to fight diverse rebel groups who continue to operate in the eastern part of the country. These rebels finance their operations in large part by smuggling conflict minerals to Rwanda and other neighboring countries. Watchdog groups have repeatedly caught the Rwandan governmentsupplying weapons and military expertise to rebel groups.

The ethnic Tutsi genocide, where an estimated 70% of the Tutsi population were slaughtered, and the Rwandan Civil War ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) overthrew the then-Hutu-dominated Rwandan government (Tutsi refugees had earlier founded the RPF in neighboring Uganda to the east). Despite the victory, all was not well across the border with the DRC to the west where erstwhile perpetrators of the genocide had formed militia groups. Rwanda, under current President Paul Kagame, confronted this challenge head on. Rwanda invaded the DRC twice, in the First (1996-97) and Second (1998-2003) Congo Wars. Perpetrating these wars meanttrampling U.N.-backed ceasefires.
According to many accounts, the Clinton Administration’s foreign policy establishment was horrified by the failure of the United States to take action in defense of the Tutsi during the genocide. Because of this, President Clinton’s Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Susan Rice, was inclined to give the new Rwandan government a free hand to do what it felt necessary to guarantee its security.
Immediately following Rice’s first trip to the “Great Lakes Region” which encompasses Eastern DRC, Uganda and Rwanda, a member of her staff said: “[Uganda President] Museveni and [Rwandan President] Kagame agree that the basic problem in the Great Lakes is the danger of a resurgence of genocide and they know how to deal with that. The only thing we [the U.S.] have to do is look the other way.” According toother sources, Secretary Rice said this herself.
With the world’s superpower sanguine about Rwandan military actions, Rwanda was able to transition directly from these wars to participating in peacekeeping in 2004, the same year that Rwanda (formally) withdrew its troops from combat operations in DRC, said Jordan Anderson, Risk Analyst for Sub-Saharan Africa at IHR Markit. Anderson toldLima Charlie World, “peacekeeping now provides an alternative form of field experience for Rwandan troops and thus helps perpetuate (and demonstrate) Rwanda’s military capabilities.”
On top of military experience, peacekeeping (essentially armed Rwandans in internationally recognized clothing) relieved pressure from yet another challenge: the nation’s military. Still flush with the excess manpower of the civil war, it needed to be scaled down to a financially sustainable number of soldiers. Note, though, that reducing the size of a military has destabilized many an African country as freshly unemployed soldiers have been known to respond violently to sudden unemployment. (ReadLima Charlie’s coverage of cyclical unrest in the Ivory Coast).
Anderson stated that significant reductions in the number of Rwandan troops participating in peacekeeping “could push some already-discontented officers and soldiers to leave Rwanda and defect to anti-RPF armed groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, but they would still struggle to pose a threat to Rwanda’s internal security.”

Even with thousands of its soldiers and police deployed with the U.N. every year, thus lightening the nation’s financial load, Rwanda expends great effort on the demobilization of its former soldiers. Through the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission, which the U.N. also supports, the Rwandan government has demobilized some 70,000 former soldiers.
The money that flows to the Rwandan government in exchange for assisting peacekeeping is but a fraction of the overall assistance offered from abroad. Rwanda receivesin excess of $1 billion annually, a not insubstantial amount for a country with a GDP of less than $9 billion.
“Rwanda’s relationships with the donor countries that provide international assistance (particularly the U.S. and some EU states) are more important than its relationships with the U.N. per se,” said Anderson. “The U.N. is important to the extent that it can influence these donor relationships.”
For example, the initial participation of Rwanda in U.N. peacekeeping operations quickly resulted in an expansion of military assistance from the U.S.
In an April 2006 diplomatic cableobtained by Wikileaks, Jendayi Frazer (who was the Bush Administration’s Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs succeeding Rice), stated, “The USG (U.S. government) has been providing logistical and training support for the Rwandan contribution to AMIS (African Mission to Sudan) since initial deployment in August 2004,” describing how U.S. military assistance to Rwanda began in tandem with their U.N. participation. “The U.S. Air Force and U.S.-funded contract airlines have provided transport for all troop deployments, and U.S. contractors have conducted training for over 2,900 RDF (Rwanda Defense Forces) soldiers in preparation for the Darfur deployments; an additional 530 are currently being trained.”
[Trucks at the Rwanda/Uganda Border. Ugandaimpounded Rwandan trucksat this border in November 2018 while transporting minerals worth $750,000. (AmarinAfrica photo via Wikicommons)]Thus, gaining this foothold in 2004, U.S. support for Rwandan peacekeeping expanded. The U.S. military’s African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP), a program that continues to ease the logistical burden of peacekeeping byutilizing AFRICOM assets, costs$100 million plus annually. Rwanda joined the U.S.’s Africa Contingency Operations Training & Assistance (ACOTA) program in 2006, a program for training African troops. Accordingto the U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, the majority of the Rwandan Army has received training through this program, which the U.S. continues to fund by tens of millions a year.
However, Rwanda’s claim that it withdrew militarily from the DRC in 2003 was less than met the eye. In 2012, the U.N.issued a report laying bareRwanda’s covert support for “M23” rebels in the DRC. The M23 rebels (one rebel group among many in the eastern DRC ) consisted of mutinying DRC soldierswho claimed they were displeased with the implementation of a 2009 peace deal. Reuters broke the story, reporting that Rwandan support for the rebels, which were targeting U.N. peacekeepers, included both weapons and military experts. The report stated that Rwanda had effectively “annexed” Congolese territory, which furthered Rwanda’s access to the region’s mineral wealth, including access to conflict minerals.
The U.N. was then obliged to expend blood and treasure against a group that had received the support of the Rwandan military, a military that was already receiving U.N. support.
[U.S. soldier examines a weapon before allowing the soldier, and 850 other Rwandan soldiers, to board a U.S. Air Force plane in route to the Central African Republic to aid French and African Union operations. (U.S. Air Force photo/ Staff Sgt. Ryan Crane)]According to subsequent2013 investigationsby Global Witness, the minerals were smuggled into Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda, and then exported as if they had been been mined in those countries. As international outrage mounted, international donors started to cut off aid to Rwanda, and a year later the U.S. government issued sanctions.
“The U.S. decision in 2013 to block its military aid to Rwanda (over these allegations) — that really got the attention of the Rwandan government,” said Anderson. “The M23 experience helped shift the Rwandan government’s security strategies away from relying on such overt meddling in DRC, and towards exerting its influence there through more subtle means.”
However,Dr. Gary Busch,Lima Charlie Worldcontributor and long standing academic observer of Rwandan Affairs, stated that the 2012 international incident had a limited impact on Rwanda.
“The U.S. State Department, Department of African Affairs, was backing (Rwandan President) Kagame against (DRC President) Kabila,” said Dr. Busch, citing the roles of Susan Rice and Jendayi Frazer.
In 2012,Foreign Policyreported thatwhen France’s U.N. ambassador pushed Susan Rice, who was then back in government as President Obama’s U.N. Ambassador, to act on the 2012 U.N. report, she dismissed the concerns.
“[I]t’s eastern Congo. If it were not the M23 killing people, it would be some other armed groups,” Rice said, according to FP.
The FP piece also outlines in detail how Rice and the U.S. delayed publication of the U.N. report and influenced the language of the report to downplay Rwanda’s meddling in the eastern Congo.
In response to international pressure, the Rwandan government implemented reforms, anddeclared itself freeof conflict minerals in 2015. Nonetheless, a boon of artisanal gold productionreached $400 millionin eastern Congo in 2015, of which 98% was smuggled out of the country. In 2017, a Belgian company set up a gold-trading facility in Rwanda moving 1 ton ($500 million) a month. The company, which had also set up a facility in Uganda, waslater found to be trading conflict minerals. Again, the Rwandan government reformed, anddeclared itself free of conflict mineralsin 2019. The most prominent NGOs working on conflict minerals doubt this claim on the part of Rwanda.

M23 is long gone, but the eastern Congo is still suffused with rebels, who regularly attack peacekeepers and DRC soldiers. 8 peacekeepers were killed on Nov. 15, 2018. (Sylvain Liechti / MONUSCO)]Frazer, the Bush Administration’s Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, who had succeeded Rice, would eventually worklobbying for the Whitaker Group, whichhad been contractedby Rwanda’s long-term ally Uganda, andremains closewith that organization today. President Trump’s current Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy,doesn’t appear to be rocking the boat, but who knows what is happening behind closed doors?
“I think there are quite important PR advantages domestically (to peacekeeping participation) – [Rwandan] people are proud of their military’s role in peacekeeping,” Nina Wilén toldLima Charlie World. “It is a way to wash off their victim status and become heroes.”
Rwanda has been transformed from the shambles it was in following the genocide. The country has posted growth rates averaging 7-8% between 2005 and 2018, and the poverty rate has fallen precipitously.
Symbolic of this change in Rwanda’s fortunes is the fact that President Kagame, who still leads his country 25 years after the RPF gained power, spent the last year as chair of the African Union (AU). Last September, at the U.N. “Action for Peacekeeping” meeting, directly before he stepped down as chair, Kagame emphasized, “The United Nations and the African Union must collaborate closely, including by ensuring stable funding for African Union-mandated peace support operations.”
The 2018 meeting expressly sought commitment on the part of U.N. members to “enhance” funding for AU peacekeeping. The AU is unable to rely on member states to secure funding, with just2.3% of its fundscoming from African countries. This canresult in inconsistencyin payments to troops in the field, with some troops going months without pay, and even reliance onbailouts from the E.U.
Shoring up AU finances is a key issue for Rwanda, which is further compensated for contributions to the AU peacekeeping operations in Darfur, Mali, and Central African Republic (CAR).
How have decades of U.S. and U.N. military support transformed Rwanda’s military? Kagame trumpeted Rwanda’s strength while attending the third annual “Hard Punch” military exercise in 2018. Hard Punch was as much a training exercise as it was a showcase for brandnew Chinese military hardware.

“Rwanda’s military advantage compared to some of its neighbours – while by no means overwhelming – is driven by the quality and capability of its troops, rather than any numerical or quantitative superiority,” described Anderson.
Building qualitative superiority requires superior weaponry. With the international donor footing a large portion of the Rwandan military’s payroll, logistics and training bills, Rwanda has been importing state of the art Chinese hardware. The weapons on display at Hard Punch were new imports from the Chinese defense company Norinco. China has been a long-time arms exporter to Rwanda, and Rwanda is presently in the process of acquiring the Sky Dragon 50, a brand-new surface-to-air missile system.
Meanwhile, Russian diplomats have beensniffing around, trying to drum up business for Russian arms manufacturers, but have not yet made substantive deals. Russia’s nuclear industry hashad better luck, though. The Russians and Rwandans have reached a nuclear technology sharing agreement.
The country’s capital, Kigali, is the jewel among Kagame’s accomplishments. It ispeppered with government development projects. A $300 million convention center, an $800 million airport, a 1,200 room 5-Star hotel, luxury apartments, the government sponsored airline RwandAir, new roads, etc., all contribute to an ambitious goal – to transform a small landlocked African country best known for a genocide into a world-class tourist and conference destination.
International observers now question whether Kagame is pushing his luck and that of his countrymen. At question is whether this remade Rwanda will diversify its economic base, offering jobs to everyday Rwandans, and whether growth is sustainable. The economy ischaracterized by monopoliessupported by government contracts, and owned by the country’s ruling party.
According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2017 the government’sdebt to GDP ratiorose to 40.2%, a 25% rise since 2012. The IMF is warning that this outsized ratio could spell trouble for Rwanda’s economy in 2023 when the debt starts to mature.
David Hambara, President Kagame’s former economic advisor, has turned into one of the most strident critics of the Rwandan government and frequently sounds the alarm about theeconomic future of the country.
“Although cheap concessional loans provided by multilateral lenders such as the World Bank still constitute the bulk of public debt, commercial loans have increased sharply,” Hambaradescribed in a Medium post. “As these loans mature, principal and interest payments become an issue. Already, serving debts has become a headache. The government admits that some of the domestic debts ‘have been rolled over due to the cash flow needs.'” Hambara exclaims, “Welcome to Kagame’s Banana Republic.”
Add to this the fact that the current U.S. administration has cut international aid and support for the U.N., ispushing for further cuts, and is trying tocut importsfrom Rwanda to the U.S. It is clear that Rwanda is in hot water.
If the IMF and Hambara are correct, Rwanda’s debt load will soon place the country under economic strain. Militarily strengthened by decades of U.S. and international support and Chinese arms imports, a country with a history of fencing its neighbors’ natural resources will need to find new revenue streams … unless the blocks of empty luxury condos in the capital actually fill up.

Lima Charlie Worldreached out to the Permanent Mission of Rwanda in New York for comment on this story, but received no reply.

Title: Kongos Präsident besucht Ruanda: Historische Aussöhnung - taz.de
Kongos neuer Präsident Tshisekedi gedenkt in Ruandas Hauptstadt Kigali der Völkermordopfer und trifft seinen Amtskollegen Kagame.
Handschlag unter alten Feinden: Kongos Präsident Felix Tshisekedi wird in Kigali begrüßtFoto: Kigali Today
KIGALItaz| Als FelixTshisekedi, seit Januar Präsident der Demokratischen Republik Kongo, am Montagmorgen in Ruandas Hauptstadt Kigali einen weißen Blumenkranz in der zentralen Genozid-Gedenkstätte niederlegt, wirkt es wie der Anfang einer neuen, vielleicht sogar freundschaftlichen Beziehung.
Es ist mehr als nur ein symbolischer Akt: In wenigen Tagen beginnen in Ruanda die Gedenkfeierlichkeiten zum 25. Jahrestag des Völkermordes an über einer Million Tutsi. Die ruandische Hutu-MilizFDLR(Demokratische Kräfte zur Befreiung Ruandas) hält im Ostkongo seit Jahren die Völkermord-Ideologie aufrecht und kämpft gegen Ruanda, das seinerseits jahrelang kongolesische Rebellen unterstützt hat.
Tshisekedis Besuch wirkte fast beiläufig. Noch am Sonntagnachmittag jubelte Kongos Präsident in Kinshasa seiner Nationalmannschaft zu, als sie Liberia mit 1:0 besiegte und sich für die Afrikameisterschaft qualifizierte. Am gleichen Abend landete er in Kigali – als Teilnehmer des Wirtschaftsgipfels „Afrika CEO Forum“.
Mit militärischem Salut und rotem Teppich wurde Kongos frischgebackener Präsident von Ruandas Außenminister Richard Sezibera empfangen und zu Präsident Paul Kagame gefahren.
Die Verbesserung der Beziehungen wurde von langer Hand eingefädelt. Schon vergangenes Jahr, noch vor Kongos Präsidentschaftswahl, war eine hochrangige Delegation kongolesischer Geheimdienstler in Kigali zu Besuch, auf Geheiß des damaligen Präsidenten Joseph Kabilas. Man suchte Annährung, fragte nach Unterstützung für Kabilas Wunschnachfolger Emmanuel Shadary.
Dafür überreichte Kongos Militärgeheimdienst den Ruandern ein Geschenk: FDLR-Pressesprecher Laforge Fils Bazeye, der Kongos Armee ins Netz gegangen war, als er aus Uganda von einem Treffen mit ruandischen Oppositionellen zurückkam.
Ruanda steht derzeitauf Kriegsfußmit seinen beiden angrenzenden Bruderstaaten Uganda und Burundi. Der Grenzverkehr zwischen Ruanda und Uganda läuft seit Wochen nur stockend; die Regierung in Kigali wirft Uganda vor, ruandische Rebellen zu beherbergen. UN-Recherchen und Informationen aus Sicherheitskreisen lassen darauf schließen, dass eine Allianz anti-ruandischer Milizen sich in der ostkongolesischen Provinz Südkivu rüstet, mit Unterstützung aus Burundi.
Erst vergangene Woche behauptete die neue ruandische Rebellenallianz FLN (Nationale Befreiungsbewegung), sie habe Teile des Nyungwe-Waldes in Südwest-Ruanda erobert und die ruandische Armee und Marine am Kivu-See geschlagen..
Frieden mit Kongo kommt Ruanda da gerade recht. Schon vor zwei Wochen waren Tshisekedis Kabinettsdirektor und Sicherheitsberater, Vital Kamerhe und Francois Beya, zu Besuch bei Kagame. Es wurde vereinbart, gegen bewaffnete Gruppen zu kooperieren.

Title: Congo’s Ebola Problem: More Than Just the Disease – MIR
The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs
On August 1, 2018 the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) Ministry of Healthdeclaredan outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the country. Largely concentrated in the province of North Kivu, the fatal illness hasclaimedthe lives of 531 people, with the number of total documented cases amounting to 853 as of 20 February 2019. The circumstances in the DRC are particularly troubling due to the country’s high population density, mass displacement, and ongoing violence.
The World Health Organization’s (WHO) has been a major actor in responding to the crisis. Due to the DRC’s mostly landlocked position in central Africa and the fact that North Kivu shares a border with Uganda and Rwanda, the concern for further spread of EVD has required bilateralcollaborationbetween the DRC and neighbouring governments. As of December 22nd, 2018, 71 points of entry have beendeterminedin northeastern DRC thanks to the work of the DRC Ministry of Health, International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNICEF, and WHO.
There are currently over 4.5 milliondisplacedpeoples within the DRC, 12.8 million people “indireneed of assistance,” and over 536,000displaced refugeesfrom surrounding countries, with the top three countries of origin being Rwanda, The Central Africa Republic, and South Sudan. Due to the complex political climate, the there is the potential for the crisis to escalate and result in even more widespread infection in the region. The complex circumstances make it nearly impossible to track and register undocumented people who may have carried the virus into the region or who may have left the region infected, further complicating the ability to trace where patients have been and who they have been in contact with.
This outbreak of EVD differs from the West African outbreak in 2014 due tohighpopulation density in the vicinity of possible infection. On November 5th 2018, Tom Inglesby, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Securitystatedthat “If Ebola becomes endemic in substantial areas of North Kivu province, in northeastern Congo (…) there would be a sustained and unpredictable spread of the deadly virus, with major implications for travel and trade.” For comparison, there are approximately6 millionpeople in the province of North Kivu alone, while the entire population of Liberia, the country where the West Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016 wasmost deadly, is only about 4.8 million. In a region ravaged by conflict and a rapidly unravelling refugee crisis, an EVD endemic of this scale would be catastrophic.
While the DRC hassufferedfrom internal conflict for centuries, since the country’s independence from Belgium in 1960, recently, a number of new actors and belligerents have joined the conflict causing a general upsurge in violence across the region. The length and brutality of extractive colonialpracticescontinue to influence ongoing conflict, particularly the country’s control over their vast supply of natural resources, primarily cobalt, copper, and diamonds. The currentconflictis taking place between the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Mai Mai Sheka, Mai Mai Yakutumba, and the non-aligned Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), and pro-government Mai-Mai militias.
The toll of the warfare will only exacerbate the EVD epidemic, with an increasing number of health problems,gender-based violence,mass destruction of property, displacement, anddeathputting continued stress on the governments and NGOs involved. As well, with a recent presidential election plagued withillegitimacyand serious accusations of corrupt practices resulting in the victory of opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, the future of the DRC’s role in providing accountable and appropriate forces to combat both the violence and epidemic are not completely clear. To make matters even more volatile, voting in the North Kivu districts of Beni (8 seats), Beni village (2 seats), and Butembo village (4 seats) for the federal election waspostponeduntil March 2019, with the federal election chiefcitinga need to control insecurity and the EVD outbreak. These regions are inurgent needof government assistance, aid, and coordination, and this delay hinders their ability to have their concerns expressed and ultimately met.
North Kivu remains theepicentreof the outbreak, and while the region has received significant aid and attention, poor practice and structural problems have prevented any kind of permanent progress. In the communities of Butembo and Katwa, 86 percent of Ebola cases since Dec. 1 “had visited or worked in a health care facility before or after their onset of illness,”accordingto the World Health Organization. While Relais Communautaire, a “network of community volunteers who act as interface between communities and the healthcare system” havevisitedover 185,00 homes in the cities of Beni, Butembo, Katwa, Mabalako, Tchomia, and Oicha in North Kivu, due to the political turmoil it remains difficult to collect accurate information on EVD, particularly in terms of who has come into contact with the disease.
In Butembo and Katwa, a “majority of new cases are not known contacts, or are known contacts who were not followed, due in part to community resistance” and “health care workers currentlyrepresent16% of all cases.” These worrisome statisticsdemonstratea lack of engagement with the communities at risk, possible poor practice, and late onset treatment of already infected people. While the EVD vaccine has supposedly beengivento 90% of “eligible and consented persons,” the disturbingly high number of health workers infected signifies that these numbers may have been distorted.
The Ebola outbreak in the DRC shows no signs of slowing down, yet increasing access tovaccinesfor at-risk groups, continued strategic monitoring of EVD cases, and engaging civil society leaders in communication with local communities is a step in the right direction. With 46 radio stations in Beni, Mabalako, Butembo, Tchomia and Katwa, which “include programming todispelEVD rumours, increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of EVD, safe and dignified burials, and broadcast testimonies from survivors on the experience of patients in ETC,” more effective infrastructure is beingbuiltin consultation and collaboration with the hardest-hit communities. While there is potential for improvement, this crisis will continue to demand huge investment and coordination among the various parties involved. Due to the possible powder-keg of internal structural issues, the outbreak has the ability to create a prolonged period of endemic EVD and heightened hostility between civilian combatants, government forces, and a general public in distress.

Title: FDLR-Kämpfer im Ostkongo: Gewehrsalven in der Nacht - taz.de
Trotz Widerstands der Armee nimmt die Gewalt im Ostkongo zu. Nun hat die ruandische FDLR-Miliz die Provinzhauptstadt Goma angegriffen.

KIGALItaz| Selbst über die rauschende Telefonverbindung sind die Gewehrsalven zu hören – ein stetiges Knattern. Der Gesprächspartner in der ostkongolesischen Provinzhauptstadt Goma schließt Türen und Fenster. „Das ist die FDLR, die kommt“, sagt er. Dann ist die Leitung tot.
Am Sonntagmorgen werden fünf Tote im Stadtteil Ndosho gemeldet, in Buguma ein weiterer. Bereits Mitte Februar wurden in Mugunga jenseits von Ndosho fünf Menschen erschossen. Im Stadtteil Katoyi wurde im Februar eine Leiche gefunden, in Buhene zwei.
Diese Bezirke liegen am westlichen Rand der Millionenstadt, nachts gibt es kaum Strom, Polizisten und Militärs trauen sich nur selten dorthin. Damit sind die Bewohner schutzlos.
Bis heute sprechen Offizielle von „Banditen“. Doch aus gut informierten Kreisen heißt es: Es ist dieMiliz FDLR(Demokratische Kräfte zur Befreiung Ruandas). Auch ein Parlamentsabgeordneter aus Goma macht in einer Erklärung die im Kongo aktive ruandische Hutu-Miliz, die aus Tätern desruandischen Völkermordeshervorgegangen ist, verantwortlich.
FDLR-Einheiten tummeln sich seit Jahrzehnten jenseits von Ndosho. Ihre Verwandten leben zum Teil in den Vertriebenenlagern von Mugunga. Hinter Mugunga beginnt der Virunga-Nationalpark, wo die FDLR am lukrativen Handel mit Holzkohle Geld verdienen.
Kongos Armee führt seit Monaten Operationen gegen die FDLR. Einst sichere Positionen wurden aufgestöbert, FDLR-Kämpfer sind auf der Flucht. Aus langer Beobachtung der FDLR weiß man: Sobald die Miliz unter Druck gerät, rächt sie sich an der Bevölkerung.
Am Sonntag wird bekannt, dass es auch Entführungen in der Nacht gegeben hat. Wütende Bewohner von Ndosho blockieren die Hauptstraße aus Goma hinaus mit Straßensperren.

KIGALItaz| Selbst über die rauschende Telefonverbindung sind die Gewehrsalven zu hören – ein stetiges Knattern. Der Gesprächspartner in der ostkongolesischen Provinzhauptstadt Goma schließt Türen und Fenster. „Das ist die FDLR, die kommt“, sagt er. Dann ist die Leitung tot.
Am Sonntagmorgen werden fünf Tote im Stadtteil Ndosho gemeldet, in Buguma ein weiterer. Bereits Mitte Februar wurden in Mugunga jenseits von Ndosho fünf Menschen erschossen. Im Stadtteil Katoyi wurde im Februar eine Leiche gefunden, in Buhene zwei.
Diese Bezirke liegen am westlichen Rand der Millionenstadt, nachts gibt es kaum Strom, Polizisten und Militärs trauen sich nur selten dorthin. Damit sind die Bewohner schutzlos.
Bis heute sprechen Offizielle von „Banditen“. Doch aus gut informierten Kreisen heißt es: Es ist dieMiliz FDLR(Demokratische Kräfte zur Befreiung Ruandas). Auch ein Parlamentsabgeordneter aus Goma macht in einer Erklärung die im Kongo aktive ruandische Hutu-Miliz, die aus Tätern desruandischen Völkermordeshervorgegangen ist, verantwortlich.
FDLR-Einheiten tummeln sich seit Jahrzehnten jenseits von Ndosho. Ihre Verwandten leben zum Teil in den Vertriebenenlagern von Mugunga. Hinter Mugunga beginnt der Virunga-Nationalpark, wo die FDLR am lukrativen Handel mit Holzkohle Geld verdienen.
Kongos Armee führt seit Monaten Operationen gegen die FDLR. Einst sichere Positionen wurden aufgestöbert, FDLR-Kämpfer sind auf der Flucht. Aus langer Beobachtung der FDLR weiß man: Sobald die Miliz unter Druck gerät, rächt sie sich an der Bevölkerung.
Am Sonntag wird bekannt, dass es auch Entführungen in der Nacht gegeben hat. Wütende Bewohner von Ndosho blockieren die Hauptstraße aus Goma hinaus mit Straßensperren.

The DRC’s new president brings opportunities to rethink development in the Great Lakes region. With current aid policies charged with fuelling political instability, Léopold Ghins argues the status quo is unable to bring prosperity and effective peacekeeping.
Despite decades of foreign interventions, both through peacekeeping and aid, the African Great Lakes remain one of the world’s most fragile regions. So how can we understand the failures of the UN and donors in the area? The question is particularly relevant in view of the recent and contested inauguration of Félix Tshisekedi as the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Whileobservers divergeon whether the presidential change enhances the country’s prospects, such a major political event certainly calls for a renewed debate on the future of development and peace in the Great Lakes, and on the roles of outsiders therein.
Several studies point to theerroneous perceptionsof outsiders to explain why their interventions have been unable to address the root causes of conflict in the Great Lakes. However, few authors focus on the impact of UN and donor ground-level activities on regional fragility. It is chiefly through these activities that outsiders may have become part of the problem they seek to resolve.
A first way in which outsiders could be exacerbating regional fragility is through unbalanced aid allocations. From 2003–16, Rwanda received about130 and 50 per cent more aid in per capita termsthan the DRC and Burundi respectively. The country was dubbed a ‘donor darling’, while the DRC and Burundi were considered ‘donor orphans’. In the case of Rwanda aid is largely said to have contributed to growth.
In contrast, lower aid levels have gone hand in hand with very modest economic performance in Burundi, and the persistent political crisis is wiping out the small gains of the quieter 2005–15 period. In eastern DRC, low aid levels are consistent with the prioritisation of stabilisation through the costlyMission des Nations Unies pour la Stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo(MONUSCO). Meanwhile, per capita GDP in eastern DRC hasbarely progressed since the 1980s.
There are two issues with the contrasting development and security trajectories that donors have contributed to induce. First, in addition to being a development champion, Rwanda is now a regional hegemon. The country has a history of meddling in the eastern DRC region, first through direct military involvement during the Congo Wars and then bysupporting anti-government rebel groups such as the M23from 2012­–13. Althoughthe West has at times pressured Rwandato stop supporting Congolese rebels, Kagame’s successes reduce his incentives to collaborate with DRC authorities and work in favour of peace in the region. The country tends to remain hawkish on eastern DRC issues even though, asargued by Jason Stearns, ‘it is not clear that Rwanda would benefit less if there were stability’.
A second by-product of donor policies is the core-periphery structure that has emerged in the Great Lakes. At the core is the Kigali-Kampala axis, with eastern DRC, Burundi and, to some extent, North-Western Uganda together forming the periphery. People living in the core face lower security risks and have higher incomes in comparison to those in the periphery. This situation has entrenched the notion that areas in the periphery are ‘lagging behind’, and reinforces perceptions of Congo as ‘an inscrutable and un-improvable mess‘. In short, international aid policies played a part in expanding some of the economic and political divisions of the Great Lakes region.
The undesirable effects of MONUSCO are another channel through which outsiders may be aggravating regional fragility. The presence of large numbers of UN personnel in towns like Goma have created dual labour markets for cooks, cleaners and drivers. High expatriate salaries ledreal estate prices to plummet. Because of MONUSCO, Kinshasa has limited incentives to expand its military capacity in the east.
On the other hand, by protecting the main urban centres, MONUSCO bases prevent any armed group in Kivu and Ituri from overpowering others. Even if the UN mission plays an essential role in civilian protection, it could also be ‘condemning’ myriad rebel formations to coexist indefinitely. Not only does MONUSCO divert resources away from productive foreign investments in the Congolese economy, but it also distorts local markets and might impede on the kinds of ‘autonomous recovery’ processes that conflicts are sometimes found to induce.
Beyond the adverse effects of aid and MONUSCO, the manner in which the UN and donors connect with local actors is also of prime importance. How intervention relates to violence depends on the complementarities between insider and outsider strategies, which can perpetuate the ‘status quo’.
The genealogies of ruling parties in Burundi and Rwanda have largely contributed toshape their relations with outsiders. Donors, for their part, see Rwanda as a useful reservoir of development success stories, and bashing Burundian authorities is a cheap way to project a pro-human rights image. In eastern DRC, the security status quo enforced by MONUSCO prevents rebellions from spinning out of control, which lets regional elites carry on with theplunder of natural resources. In turn, the international community does not oppose the status quo as it wants to avoid the disturbances and humanitarian costs that a third Congo war would provoke.
The behaviour of the UN, donors and local elites together interact within a regional ‘assemblage’ or – to useMary Kaldor’s terminology– a ‘political economy of war’ which produces the path dependencies in which the region has been engulfed for so long.
A main implication here is that there could be better ways for outsiders to achieve their goals in the Great Lakes. Studying the pathways and interactions through which UN and donor activities impact on regional fragility helps identify the causes of unintended consequences. Understanding the failures of interventions through a ‘political economy of war’ lens is also fundamental for them to be appropriately reformed.
It is even more relevant in the current context of increasing fragility, and the security landscape in the Kivu and Ituri provinces is hardly sustainable, as theconstantly increasing numbers of refugees and displaced personsin the region reveals. Rwanda’s authoritarian development policies have kept internal tensions in the country alive and well.
The election of Tshisekedi is an opportunity to bring intellectual fresh air to the debates around development and peace in the Great Lakes. Fragile regions deserve better than stagnation and violent status quos. International actors should learn from their mistakes to avoid creating islands of economic growth or introducing costly peacekeeping missions. They may bring short-term relief but not sustainable peace.

Title: UN to boost Congo presence – DW – 07/11/2012
The UN will reinforce its presence in North Kivu, Congo, to help stop a destructive rebel movement in its tracks. It is the latest development in a conflict with tragic historical roots.
The United Nations announced on Wednesday that it is to send more peacekeeping troops to Congo's North Kivu province to put a stop to rebel attacks plaguing the troubled area.
Roger Meece, the special representative of the UN secretary general and head of the UN mission to the Congo, also said on Wednesday that the UN as working with Congolese troops to defend major urban centers, including Goma, where the Congolese military have struggled to put down a rebellion being coordinated by a renegade group of soldiers called M23. The M23 are a collection of Tutsi rebels who were initially set up to fight against a Hutu rebellion in the Congo.
The UN breakthrough came on the same day that the Congolese army retook the towns of Rutshuru and Kiwanja, which the rebels took hold of over the weekend.
Meece also criticized support that Rwanda is alleged to have given to the M23 rebel movement in the region.
"There is a lot of information that implicates support by Rwanda in the M23 rebel movement. It's an unacceptable situation and it must stop immediately,” he said.
Congolese officials in North Kivu had also condemned Kigali on Tuesday for “invading” the region.
Roots in the Rwandan genocide
The longstanding conflict in eastern Congo traces back to the spillover effects of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when radical members of the Hutu ethnic group tried to systematically exterminate ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Eight hundred thousand opposing Tutsis and Hutus fled across the border into Congo, where fighting between the two sides has continued to this day.
Since the M23 was first created in April, more than 200,000 people in North Kivu have been compelled to flee their homes, 20,000 of them as far as across the borders into Rwanda and Uganda.
UN troops in Congo currently number 17,000, and there has been a UN peacekeeping presence in the country for more than 10 years.

Title: ISS: The Great Lakes can’t afford more instability - defenceWeb
Regional tensions in the Great Lakes are reaching an alarming level, with neighbours Rwanda and Uganda publicly raising the tone over the past few weeks. This is unusual – the two presidents usually prefer to settle their differences behind closed doors.
Uganda says Rwanda is infiltrating its security services and spying on Ugandan state security. Rwanda, in turn, accuses Uganda of supporting anti-Rwandan rebels. Rwanda also says Uganda has been torturing Rwandan nationals, while Uganda accuses Rwanda of assassinating Rwandan dissidents on its territory.
In early March, Rwanda closed part of its border with Uganda in response to Uganda’s expulsion of some 40 Rwandans allegedly involved in spying on the Ugandan state. Rwanda also warned its citizens against travelling to Uganda, saying they risked facing arrest or harassment.
The next week, Kagame issued a threat to Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni: ‘You can attempt to destabilise our country, you can do us harm, you can shoot me with a gun and kill me. But there is one thing that is impossible – no one can bring me to my knees.’
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what triggered this deterioration. And both countries know that open war between them would be devastating to their populations, to stability in the Great Lakes, and to economic development in East Africa.
Rwanda and Uganda are familiar with one another’s tactics, but they’ve usually been on the same side
What it does tell us is that the Great Lakes has failed to address one of the key drivers of instability – the regionalisation of national political struggles. This regionalisation is driven by several dynamics: repressive political environments; governments’ unwillingness to negotiate political settlements with their opponents; regional bodies’ instrumentalisation of these opponents; the inability of several countries to control their own territory and borders; and secondary drivers like illegal economic activities.
Both Rwanda and Uganda have sponsored and hosted such movements over the past two decades, and are familiar with one another’s tactics and motivations. But they’ve usually been on the same side.
Twenty-five years ago, the Rwandan Patriotic Front left its bases in Uganda to overthrow the Hutu-led government in Rwanda. Before that Kagame helped Museveni win power. Rwanda and Uganda both helped oust Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, and they worked together in 1998 to try to overthrow Congolese president Laurent Kabila, then backed local proxies in the following five-year war.
Uganda was instrumental in stoking ethnic violence between Hema and Lendu in Ituri province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the late-1990s. It then backed all sides in a conflict that killed almost 100 000 people and allowed it to syphon off Congolese resources. Later, both Rwanda and Uganda supported Tutsi-led rebels, who became the M23, in the eastern DRC.
Both countries have developed substantial economic networks in the eastern DRC that largely benefit their countries’ political and military elites. Competition over access to resources may also be a factor in the current tensions, as they were in 2000 when the two armies clashed in Kisangani, DRC, in battles that killed over 1 000 Congolese civilians.
Regional peace accords have not addressed Rwanda and Uganda’s central role in the DRC conflict
Regional peace and security frameworks and peace accords have been ineffective in addressing Rwanda and Uganda’s central role in the DRC conflict; most have been too singularly focused on the DRC’s many governance failings.
The Peace and Security Cooperation Framework was signed by 11 neighbouring countries in 2013 following the re-emergence of the M23. The framework singled out the DRC and imposed on it a series of internal reforms, while the other signatories committed themselves to refraining from supporting anti-government rebels in the region. Whatever commitment there was to this framework has faded.
To be effective, a new regional approach to peace and stability must address governance and political instability in all core Great Lakes countries, and relations between them. This won’t be easy. The relationships between heads of state are almost familial, making it hard for external bodies to be accepted as mediators.
Rwanda and Burundi also both refuse to speak with their armed opposition or to accept that domestic politics is driving conflict. Their relationship is a major concern for the region.
The AU needs to step into the breach left by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region
Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to stand for a third term in 2015 sparked massive unrest and the subsequent crackdown on political freedoms led to an exodus of civil society and political opponents from Burundi. Many relocated to Rwanda. Since then, Burundi has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting armed anti-government groups trying to overthrow it.
Rwanda denies this, but there has been some evidence that it has allowed training to take place in refugee camps on its territory in the past. The East African Community, under Museveni’s leadership, has skirted these issues, focusing instead on trying to mediate Burundi’s internal political crisis.
The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region is too weak to lead a strong regional initiative and generate the political will needed among member states. But it is the only regional mechanism that includes the core Great Lakes countries.
The African Union (AU) needs to step into this breach and take a pro-active role in bringing these heads of state together. Regional tensions should be discussed at the AU Peace and Security Council, which can direct the AU on how to most effectively address the deteriorating relations between countries.
Other important regional players like Tanzania and South Africa can also help drive this process, especially at the level of heads of state, where tensions need to be de-escalated. South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa has experience in the region, and is respected by its leaders. Tanzania has a long history in the Great Lakes and is a member of the East African Community. Its President John Magufuli could play a significant role.
The tensions between Uganda and Rwanda, and Rwanda and Burundi, may not spark a war between these countries, but they could lead to another proxy conflict in eastern DRC. They certainly further undermine cooperation on peace and security in this volatile area. This is an important opportunity for African players to prevent an escalation of conflict in the region.

Title: Senate confirms 37-year-old federal judge as Dems condemn her ties to 'hate group' - American Thinker
The Senate confirmed Allison Jones Rushing to the 4th U.S. District Court of Appeals, making the 37-year-old one of the youngest federal judges in history.Rushing's qualifications were questioned, but her greatest sin was her association with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a public interest law firm that has opposed redefining marriage on religious freedom grounds and defended businesses and individuals who ran afoul of the various local and state gay rights statutes.Rushing never worked for ADF but did intern with the group in 2005.  Do you think that stopped her detractors from trying to smear her as a hateful bigot and ADF as a "hate group"?NBCNews:"Throughout her brief legal career, Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organizations operating in this country today, the Alliance Defending Freedom," Ian Wilhite, a spokesperson for LGBTQ legal group Lambda Legal, said in a statement shared with NBC News.  "Rather than disqualifying her from consideration, this aspect of her record seems to have made up for all of the other deficiencies in her record."The 4th Circuit Court, which sits one level below the Supreme Court, covers West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas.  Lambda Legal estimates there are roughly 1 million LGBTQ people who live in those states.ADF's mission is to defend their conception of religious freedom and free speech.  Other public interest law firms defend their conception of "women's rights" or "civil rights."  The ADF holds views on gays and marriage that are at odds with the LGBT community but faithful to their own interpretation of the Constitution.The designation of ADF as a "hate group" is spurious.
