Between February 9-13, 2017, clashes resulted in over 100 fatalities, including women and police officers. The government's armed forces (FARDC) have also faced accusations of using excessive force against civilians, leading to significant internal displacement.\n\n2. **North Kivu and Eastern DRC**: \n   - North Kivu has long been a hotspot for conflict, with ongoing clashes involving various armed groups, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). Since October 2014, these groups have been responsible for over 700 civilian deaths in massacres, often targeting vulnerable populations. Inter-communal violence continues with armed groups vying for control amidst a backdrop of political instability.\n\n3. **M23 Rebels and Political Crisis**:  \n   - The M23 rebels have resurfaced, continuing a cycle of conflict linked with competition over land and mineral wealth. The DRC government has been accused of failing to effectively negotiate peace agreements with these rebel groups, reflecting ongoing instability exacerbated by President Joseph Kabila's grip on power beyond the expiration of his mandate in December 2016.\n\n4. **Widespread Armed Group Activity**: \n   - The United Nations has recognized the persistent threat posed by armed groups across the Great Lakes region, urging enhanced cooperation among regional countries to combat illegal armed activities. The Special Envoy, Said Djinnit, highlighted the need for increased military and diplomatic efforts to address the security concerns.\n\n5. **Recent Political and Civil Unrest**: \n   - Throughout 2016, the region experienced significant civil unrest, particularly surrounding delayed presidential elections, which incited protests met with violent crackdowns by security forces. Notably, between September and December 2016, various protests resulted in dozens of civilian deaths as government forces confronted demonstrators.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the DRC are deeply rooted in historical grievances, including ethnic tensions, competition over economic resources, and widespread corruption, leading to continuous cycles of violence affecting civilian populations. As such, addressing the underlying political and economic issues remains crucial in alleviating the dire humanitarian situation in the region."}
