The Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) has declared that all M23 rebels who escaped from Bihanga Military Camp are to be prosecuted.
The declaration was made by the Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Gen. David Muhoozi on Wednesday, who revealed that all escapees will have to face charges that shall be instituted by the UPDF after investigations.
Over 800 M23 fighters escaped from Bihanga Military last month, where they had been staying after surrendering to the UPDF earlier on with their commander Sultani Makenge.
The M23 movement is notable for staging a five year rebellion against the DRC government over refusal by the government to integrate them into the Congolese army.
During the conflict, M23 threatened to overrun the Kinshasa government when they cut off Eastern DRC and controlled it for two months. They however denounced war following increased international pressure and handed themselves over to the Ugandan government.

Title: DRC, M23 officials in Kampala for peace talks - 24Tanzania.com
A delegation of DR Congo officials was last evening expected to join M23 representatives in Kampala, Uganda ahead of fresh talks set to resume today as directed by regional Heads of State.

Last Thursday, five regional presidents and representatives from seven other member countries meeting under the  auspices of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) in Kampala, directed the parties to return to the negotiating table within three days after the summit to settle their differences amicably.
“The M23 delegation arrived yesterday (Sunday) and we expect the DRC delegation to have arrived by this evening,” Ofwono Opondo, Uganda Media Centre Executive Director told The New Times yesterday.
The regional leaders also directed that the talks should be concluded within 14 days during which maximum restraint must be exercised on the ground – in eastern DRC – to give room for the talks.
Talks between the two sides were suspended in May.
M23 conditions
The directive to resume the talks follows recent renewed fighting in eastern DRC between the rebels and Congolese troops backed by a special United Nations force.
Opondo said Dr Crispus Kiyonga, Uganda’s Minister for Defence and facilitator of the dialogue, will address the media today on the way forward of the dialogue.
M23 chairman Bertrand Bisimwa, meanwhile, was yesterday quoted as telling the journalists in Bunagana, eastern DRC that they will resume the talks with only two conditions.
“Disarm the rebels of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) which will guarantee security of our people and return refugees, and M23 will be no more,” he said.
He added that solving FDLR problem will guarantee the security of the Congolese people which the M23 have been fighting for.
The FDLR is made up of elements largely blamed for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda in which over a million people died in a three-month slaughter campaign.

Ugandan military arrest 43 former DR Congo rebels for illegal entry - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan military said it has arrested 43 former Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) rebel group M23 fighters over illegal entry into the country with arms.
Maj. Henry Obbo, Uganda's deputy military spokesperson, told Xinhua Tuesday that the fighters were intercepted over the weekend in the western district of Kasese while attempting to cross into Uganda with guns.

Title: At least 22 dead in DRC army clashes with M23 rebels | News24
Friday, 20 September
02 Mar 2017
Goma - The Congolese army said on Wednesday it had killed 20 fighters from the M23 militia group and lost two soldiers in clashes with the rebels since the end of January.
General Leon Mushale told reporters in the eastern city of Goma that a further 25 rebels either were captured or surrendered and that six soldiers had been injured.
The clashes occurred in the eastern part of DRC, on and near the border with Uganda, on January 31 and also on February 20 to 22, according to the army.
Mushale, who heads military operations in North Kivu province, said the rebels fled "some to Uganda, others to Rwanda".
M23 is a mostly ethnic Tutsi rebel group that mutinied against the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2012, saying a peace accord signed in 2009 had not been respected by the government.
The militia was defeated the following year, and hundreds of fighters fled the country.
But in January, the Congolese government and numerous witnesses said former M23 rebels were spotted in the North Kivu village of Rutshuru, having crossed over from neighbouring Uganda.
The group still poses a threat to peace and security in the east of DRC, said UN peacekeeping mission Monusco, adding it has received "many signs" that former fighters remain.
DRC's resource-rich east has suffered nearly two decades of brutal conflict, with neighbouring states backing rebel groups in a civil war against Kinshasa's authority, and roaming armed militia triggering the mass flight of terrorised civilians.

Title: DRC court sentences 9 rebels to death over killings | News24
Friday, 20 September
10 Mar 2017
Beni - A Congolese court on Friday sentenced to death nine rebels and acquitted two others as the government seeks to hold a rebel group accountable for attacks that have killed more than 1 000 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo since October 2014.
The convicted were prosecuted for crimes against humanity, terrorism and participation in a rebellion, presiding judge Lt. Col. Jean-Paulin Esosa Basema said.
They are members of the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group founded in neighboring Uganda that is now based in DRC.
A third defendant was transferred to a court for minors, the judge said.
The trial of more than 100 defendants began in December.
Beni residents said they were satisfied with the first sentencings in the trial, and they said they hope it brings further international intervention against the violence in the region.
The ADF rebels are among scores of armed groups vying for control in mineral-rich eastern DRC.
The ADF rebel movement has been active since the 1990s but intensified its attacks inside DRC several years ago.
The president of the local human rights group, Omar Kavota, said that while he welcomed the trial and the great consideration given to the convictions, he did not welcome the death sentences.

Title: Army denies involvement in sexual violence - New Vision Official
Mar 01, 2017
The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) has refuted allegations that some of their personnel are have been engaged in sexual violence in Northern Uganda.The head of human rights affairs in the UPDF, Col. Charles Wacha refuted the allegations saying it was not true."Those must be wrong characters who were using military outfits and the community thought it was UPDF" he said.This was during a UPDF workshop on the International Protocol on Documentation and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict at Protea Hotel in Kampala.The workshop was the climax of six months training of UPDF, Police, women rights activists, civil society and medical students among others, facilitated through the Refugee Law Project (RLP) funded by the British High Commission.During the event several human rights activists said that they had received several complaints about UPDF personnel sexually abusing women in Northern Uganda.Wacha explained that during the time of rebellion in the area; "some of our uniforms ended up in the hands of rebels and many of the victims thought it was UPDF."He noted that the army had received similar complaints, and decided to decommission some of the uniforms."All other uniforms were decommissioned and we now only have three types including; digital, office and ceremonial uniforms. This helps us to easily identify ourselves," he noted.Wacha said those found clad in the decommissioned uniforms would be arrested on sight.He also explained that conflicts in Kasese are as a result of proximity of the area to DRC, propaganda by interest groups and land disputes."The proximity of Kasese to DRC has caused us problems. They deceive children that they are taking them to school and later recruit them into ADF" he said.Wacha added that UPDF has decided to introduce special economic programmes including; Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) and Youth Livelihood Program (YLP) among others to engage the youth into developmental programs.He said UPDF also recommended to government that they work on land reforms in the area because the biggest area in Kasese is under national parks."We are looking at none militarization solutions to see how we can help locals and leaders to promote peace and development," he said.

Title: Father of UN Expert Killed in Congo Wants Son's Work to Continue
Print
For the last five years, Michael J. Sharp lived in one of the most dangerous countries in Africa, trying to broker peace between armed groups.
"He was following his passion and mission to make peace in the world — a very broken and violent world," his father, John Sharp, told VOA in an interview late Thursday.
That mission ended when Sharp, Swedish colleague Zahida Catalan and their interpreter, Betu Tshintela, were killed after being abducted in Kasai Central province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo earlier this month. Their bodies were found March 28 in a shallow grave next to the Moyo River.

The fate of a Congolese driver, Isaac Kabuayi, and two motorcycle drivers who were also kidnapped remains unknown.
Sharp, also known as MJ, and Catalan were working as experts for the United Nations, investigating funding and weapons sources for militia groups in the DRC. Their goal was to determine whether U.N. Security Council sanctions against the groups are effective, and if they stop militias and members of the Congolese military from running illegal mines for profit.
Now, John Sharp said, "We are waiting for the Congolese government to give their permission to ship the body back to the U.S." Michael Sharp's body was found intact; Catalan's was decapitated.
The father believes his son's work to promote lasting stability in the troubled province should continue. "Let's let Zahida's and MJ's work continue in other hands. There's much more work to be done. Peace has not yet been negotiated," he said.
Passionate pacifist
A devout member of the Mennonite church — a branch of Christianity that emphasizes pacifism — Michael Sharp first went to the DRC as a volunteer with the Mennonite Central Committee, doing humanitarian work.
He spoke Spanish, German and French, and was learning Swahili. "He developed his passion for peacebuilding and peacemaking in a violent world from his family, his theology, his church because Mennonites have a theology of peacebuilding and nonviolence and he seemed to take that on," his father said.

Sharp collaborated with the Congolese Protestant Council of Churches, which was working to persuade rebel fighters to abandon violence and give up arms. His efforts were bearing fruit, with about 1,600 fighters in January 2015 laying down arms.
His father said Michael Sharp was willing to expose himself to risks in order to understand the causes of conflict, and he strived to build relationships with those involved.
"He was most passionate about something he initiated, I believe, and that is working to build relationships with militia group leaders, so he would travel unarmed through the forest and sit down and talk with them," his father said.
Sharp also earned the admiration of prominent DRC expert Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group and senior fellow at New York University.
The DRC is home to dozens of small militia and rebel groups who hide out in its jungles and make a living mining the country's abundant natural resources, including copper, gold and diamonds.
One of the most prominent is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), led by Rwandan Hutus fighting against what they say is a Tutsi influence in the region.

In ablog post this week, Stearns said the FDLR is "one of the most brutal and reclusive armed groups in the region." However, that didn't deter Sharp from entering into their territory unarmed, learning about their families, listening to their pleas and "trying to gain their trust and to project empathy. Not an easy feat for a committed pacifist," Stearns wrote.
Stearns said he has always been skeptical of foreigners coming in the country, but Sharp showed him that it is possible to do genuine work on behalf of the Congolese people.
"I am always wary of researchers and activists who come to the Congo for adventure and self-legitimation rather than out of solidarity with the local population," he wrote. "But Michael was no such thing — he was self-effacing, devoted, and empathetic."
Last mission
Sharp and his colleagues went to Kasai Central in early March to investigate widespread human rights abuses near the remote village of Bunkonde, south of the provincial capital, Kananga. Violence driven by political and tribal rivalries has killed hundreds in the province since last August, and several mass graves have been found.

The U.N. team disappeared March 12. The next day, the DRC government said that Sharp and Catalan had "fallen into the hands of unidentified negative forces."
Quickly, the U.N. mission in Congo, MONUSCO, began a search-and-rescue effort that ended Wednesday with the discovery of the bodies.
The eastern DRC has been plagued with violence since the mid-1990s, with millions killed and more than 2 million displaced in what is sometimes called Africa's World War. Much of the country remains beyond the reach of the central government and is controlled by militia groups.
Sharp's father wants to see Congo's perpetual conflict brought to an end, and thinks the loss of his son could trigger more attention to the cause of the conflict.
He urged the U.N. not to give up on its mission, and said more experts are needed to monitor sanctions and bring justice to the area.
"As my son said, nothing is acceptable until there is true peace and complete peace," John Sharp said. "Congolese people deserve peace, they deserve to live in harmony with their neighbors and we should make all efforts possible to make that happen and to stop believing in the myth of redemptive violence."
