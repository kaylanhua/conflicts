The United Nations General Assembly has approved $6.8 billion in peacekeeping expenditures for the 2017/18 budget year. This total will increase, possibly to as much as$7.3 billion, since states only agreed on the first six months of funding for two ongoing operations. Yet even that total would still be some $600 million less than the amount requested by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and $500 million less than the approved resources for the previous year.
United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley hascelebrated this reduction: “Just five months into our time here, we’ve already been able to cut over half a billion dollars from the U.N. peacekeeping budget and we’re only getting started.” The UN’s Africa Grouphas warned, however, that excessive budget cuts would “endanger the implementation of [mission] mandates.”

This potentially effective unit is being hamstrung by politics and concerns about using force in peace operations.
The Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), the sharp end of MONUSCO – the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – earned its stripes in 2013 when it helped the DRC’s army defeat the powerful Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in the east of the country.
But not a lot has been heard about the FIB since, though it has remained deployed in the eastern part of the country for four years. What has it been doing?
The unit of some 3 000 troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi has a more muscular mission than the rest of MONUSCO to use necessary force to ‘neutralise’ all the ‘negative’ armed rebel groups in eastern DRC. Its second target was supposed to be the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the armed group founded in the mid-1990s by Rwandan Hutus who fled the country after the genocide against the Tutsis.
The attention of the world has recently been focused on the humanitarian tragedy of the violent conflict being pursued by various armed groups in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), specifically since the rapid advance during November 2012 of the rebel group known as the March 23 Movement (M23) that operates mainly in the Congolese province of North Kivu.
M23 managed to capture the regional Congolese capital of Goma on 20 November 2012 after the withdrawal of about 2 000 soldiers from the Congolese National Army (FARDC) and 700 Congolese policemen. Goma fell to the rebel group despite the presence of nearly 6 000 armed peacekeepers in the North Kivu province, over 1 500 in the Goma area alone, under the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). This included a battalion of 850 South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers, all deployed under a United Nations (UN) Security Council mandate written in terms of Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, which allows the use of ‘coercive measures’ (force) in support of mission objectives. With nearly 2 000 000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in the Eastern DRC and the UN reporting that it had lost access to 30 of 31 IDP camps, international intervention was clearly needed.

Title: D.R. Congo: Top humanitarian official calls for protection of civilians - 24Tanzania.com
GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 23, 2013–Humanitarian Coordinator Moustapha Soumaré is calling for all parties to respect international humanitarian law after three people were killed and 14 wounded by shells dropped north-west of the city of Goma on 22 May.Humanitarian Coordinator Moustapha SoumaréOn 22 May, three shells exploded in the crowded neighborhood of Ndosho, located in the north-west of the city of Goma killing three people and wounding another ten. The explosions, which took place next to churches, provoked panic among the population, causing many to flee towards downtown Goma in search of safer haven. The previous night, three shells exploded next to Mugunga III IDP camp, about 10 km west of Goma which hosts 13,000 IDPs, wounding four people and destroying several houses.“I am very concerned with the developments yesterday in Goma” said Moustapha Soumaré, the Humanitarian Coordinator in DRC. “Civilians have been injured during military operations because military positions and military actions are taking place too close to where civilian populations are located, a violation of International Humanitarian Law. Civilians should not be mistaken for military targets. I call on all parties to take all measures necessary to avoid civilian casualties.”Thousands of people, including internally displaced persons, have fled insecurity since fighting resumed on 20 May 2013 between the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) and the M23 rebellion. Some have sought shelter in churches and schools in the center of Goma town, while others have moved towards the city of Sake, located 25 km west of Goma.North Kivu, one of the country’s mineral rich province, has been destabilized for decades by armed fighting, maintaining the population in a cycle of insecurity and vulnerability.“As the humanitarian community, we are extremely concerned about the protection of civilians and the insecurity which is hindering our capacity to assist people in urgent need of help. Humanitarian agencies are calling for total, unimpeded access to those in need”, added M. Soumaré.The mineral-rich province hosts more than 973,000 internally displaced people, representing more than one third of the 2.6 million displaced people in the country. Since November 2012, humanitarian agencies have worked to mobilize the resources required to assist hundreds of thousands of people still displaced or returning home. Humanitarian organizations fear that the current deterioration of the situation risks exposing even more people to increasing suffering and need.

Title: US and UK fund Kagame’s killing fields: An interview with David Himbara  | Pambazuka News

Rwandan dictator Paul Kagame will stage sham elections this week to keep himself in power for another term. He has already arranged to stay in office until 2034, if he chooses. Those who challenge the vote count often wind up dead, or in prison, like Victoire Ingabire – which is fine with Washington, Kagame’s major backer.
Rwandans will go to the polls to elect a president on August 4, but asking whether General Paul Kagame will win is like asking whether bears shit in the woods. I nevertheless asked David Himbara, author of Kagame’sEconomic MirageandKagame’s Killing Fields, just to get this conversation started.
Ann Garrison:David Himbara, who’s going to win next week’s election?
David Himbara:General Paul Kagame will win. There is no doubt about that.
AG:And what makes you so sure?
DH:Kagame is running against himself. Credible opposition figures are in prison, in exile, or blocked from competing against him—if they haven’t been assassinated.
AG:President Kagame “won” by 93% last time. What percentage do you imagine he’ll claim this time?
DH:99.9%.
AG:That’s a hysterically high number, very close to the Ethiopian ruling party’s 100% in 2015.
DH:Well, the numbers keep going higher. Kagame won the referendum changing the constitution by 98%. Parliament voted for the change of the constitution by 99%. The Senate voted for it by 100%. So Kagame will probably win by 99.9%. His people will give the remaining tenth of a percent to the other two candidates to share.
AG:Could you explain the constitutional referendum?
DH:Kagame engineered the constitutional amendment that removed presidential term limits so that he could cling to power beyond two 7-year terms. The amended constitution allows Kagame to rule until 2034. Rwandan parliamentarians who engaged in nationwide discussions in preparation for the referendum claimed that they found only ten people opposed to removing term limits. Voters allegedly approved the referendum by over 98%.
AG:During the 2010 election year, two candidates went to prison and another went into exile after the vice president of his party was found by a riverbank with his head cut off. Journalists were shot or threatened, and Kagame’s assassins were at work in at least three more African countries. What happened this year?
DH:There was no violence this time for the simple reason that the regime has had nothing to fear. There are no genuine opposition leaders except Diane Rwigara, and she wasn’t allowed to run. Bernard Ntaganda went to prison for trying to run in the 2010 election. He’s free now, but Rwandan law prohibits anyone who has served time in prison from running for president. Victoire Ingabire of course remains in prison. And there is no independent media. TheNew Timesof Rwanda exists to glorify General Kagame. He has tightened his totalitarian grip.
AG:Who manages the voting process itself?
DH:The National Electoral Commission, which is not independent of the regime.
AG:In your bookKagame’s Killing Fields, you wrote, “From the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, each administration has invested significantly in the Rwandan military. Whether it was a Republican or Democratic presidency, the United States consistently poured millions of dollars into Rwanda’s military machine.”
You also quoted Chris Smith, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations:
“Kagame has been considered a hero on the international stage, and has long been immune to public criticism… There are credible reports that the RPF government has commissioned assassins to kill dissidents… By largely avoiding criticism of Rwandan human rights issues, the Bush and Obama administrations raised appropriations to Rwanda from $39 million in fiscal year 2003 to $188 million in fiscal year 2014.”
None of this is likely to change because of this year's election farce, but what happened last week when you went to Washington to speak to someone at the US State Department?
DH:The State Department was chaotic. The United States government is currently preoccupied with domestic issues, and Rwanda is not even on the radar. The administration hasn’t yet staffed many offices in the State Department that are concerned with Africa. For example, there is no Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. And in the lower ranks, some of them have left and some are new. So I think it will take a while for the United States to recover its interest in Africa and in Rwanda. In the meantime, the money will continue to flow because the tap’s already turned on. And that goes for the British government as well. It is currently consumed by its divorce from the European Union. Of course these two countries, the US and the UK, are General Kagame’s main backers.
AG:One of their excuses for funding Kagame’s killing fields is his claim that, under his leadership, Rwanda has risen from the ashes of genocide to become a development miracle. But you write that “only 303,550 Rwandans are employed in the formal economy, while 5.6 million are in subsistence agriculture or eking out a living in urban and rural informal sectors. Put in another way, 93 percent of Rwandan adults aged sixteen to sixty-five work outside the formal economy.” How does Kagame sustain this development-miracle myth with numbers like that?
DH:Kagame is a genius at lying, and he gets plenty of help from Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Howard Buffett, and his other powerful friends in the West. American universities also help perpetuate this big lie by inviting Kagame to speak about his so-called development miracle.
AG:InKagame’s Killing Fieldsyou also wrote, “By 1997, Kagame had become the predominant occupying power in DRC [the Democratic Republic of the Congo], a vast country ninety times larger than Rwanda.” How would you describe Rwanda’s presence in DRC now?
DH:The current situation in DRC is ideal for Kagame, because the international community is not paying particular attention to the region and the country is caught up in his own struggle to remain in power past two terms. You can be sure that right now Kagame is arming militias to loot and destabilize DRC. The latest US State Department's human rights report on Rwanda says that almost all 400 disarmed M23 rebels held in Rwanda have vanished. Where are they? No doubt in DRC plundering resources and wreaking havoc.

Title: Power Traps and Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa – MIR
The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs
Nearly every nation in Sub-Saharan Africa has faced power traps and institutional instability since their independence from European colonialism. Over the past four decades, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confronted both internal crises and constant external threats. The two nations have been intertwined in ethnic and political conflict since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when nearly 2 million Hutufledto eastern Congo fearing reprisal from the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) that retook the government.
TESTING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
On August 4th, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda wasreelectedto office for his third term, winning over 98% of the vote.An amendmentto the constitution allowing for Kagame to run for a third term was introduced in 2015 following a popular petition that received 3.7 million signatures (more than 60% of registered voters). Though Kagame is popular for his role in economic reform, improving healthcare and education, and reducing internal violence in Rwanda, there are major concerns that he is stamping outopposition movementsand that there is no protected space for other parties to develop. One opposition party, FDU-Inkingi, has been outlawed and its candidate in the 2010 election is serving a 15-year prison sentence for threatening national security. In addition, the Green Party’s Vice President was beheaded in 2010, leading up to the election. In this year’s election, most other parties did not put forward a candidate, supporting Kagame based on his successful policy and broad national popularity.
The DRC, far larger and varied in comparison, has over a dozen active parties and the incumbent is an independent. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, two successful democratic elections have taken place since its latest revision of the constitution in 2006. Joseph Kabila was elected in 2006 and reelected in 2011, but in 2016 was due to be replaced in a national election due to the established term limits. However, in September of 2016, the electoral commissionannouncedthat the election would be postponed to 2018 because a census was needed for the proper implementation of the election. The announcement caused international concern for the future of Congo’s juvenile democratic institutions and roused internal protest and conflict with opposition leaders, familiar with the modus operandi of the power-grabbing presidents of the past.
AFRICA’S WORLD WAR
Approximately 5 million people perished in the conflict between 1994 and 2003 often referred to asAfrica’s World War, in which soldiers from nine different countries clashed on Congolese soil. In 1996, theFirst Congo Warofficially began when Rwanda and Uganda invaded eastern Zaire (later the DRC) to stamp out perpetrators of the genocide and eliminate any threat of an invading Hutu force. Laurant Kabila overthrew the infamous ruling dictator Mobutu Sese Seko with the support of the two armies. He became president in 1997 and soon after ordered the two armies out of the Congo, fearing that Rwanda and Uganda would seize the mineral-rich areas of eastern DRC. Kabila received support from a number of regional partners, including Angola and Zimbabwe, in theSecond Congo War, as Rwanda accused Kabila of ambivalence toward rooting out the Hutu rebels. In 2001 Laurant Kabila was assassinated, but his son Joseph Kabila was appointed president in his place. The conflict officially came to a close in 2003, but rebel groups with various aims and allegiances have endured in eastern Congo.
A persisting trend in the conflict is Rwanda’s clandestine support of Congolese rebel groups that seek to overthrow or secede from Congo’s government and put an end to Hutu rebel groups operating in the DRC. In 2008, however, Congo and Rwanda led an assault against the Hutu rebels, ending a proxy war between Tutsi (the National Congress for the Defense of the People – CNDP) and Hutu (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda – FDLR) war bands in eastern Congo. As part of the agreement the CNDP split in 2009, with half of the group integrating into the Congolese national army and the other half resisting, forming the new rebel group M23 in 2012. The leader of M23, Bosco Ntaganda, surrendered to the International Criminal Court’s custody in 2013.
This has not spelled the end of conflict in the vast region of eastern Congo, as a handful of rebel groups continue to war with different governments, each with varying aims: the FDLR continues to operate, 2,000 combatants strong; the Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), made up of 500 Islamists, seeks to initiate Shari’a Law in Uganda; the Ugandan Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) is led by cult leader and self-proclaimed prophet Joseph Kony, who seeks Christian rule in Uganda; the Burundian National Liberation Forces (FNL) is a Hutu rebel group in alliance with FDLR and Mai-Mai Yakutumba; and various Mai-Mai militias, numbering six in total.
ROOTS OF INTERNAL CRISIS AND INSTABILITY
The issues that plague Rwanda and Congo are very different in nature. Foreign forces ruled Rwanda for nearly a century, first the German Empire and then Belgium. Before German colonization, there was a strongly centralized government that stretched over today’s Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. Hutu and Tutsi mostly shared rule until the 18thcentury when the Hutus in administrative and bureaucratic positions began to lose power and become marginalized. Hutus, which made up the large majority of the population (an estimated 85%), were mainly known for cultivation while the minority Tutsi were known as pastoralists, owning valuable cattle. As the centralization of the kingdom continued, land was distributed to individuals rather than through lineage groups (which would favour the Hutu majority), and thus Tutsi chiefs were increasingly selected. This led to increased inequality between the groups.
The social and political dynamics only worsened with German indirect rule, as Tutsi political power became entrenched with the support of the Germans. The Germans believed that the Tutsi were purer and the closest ethnic group to Europeans, introducing a racialist ideology that did not exist before European intervention. With the introduction of money, individual taxes, and larger organizing capitalist forces, the power-distance and influence of Tutsis began to decrease. It became clear that the Tutsis did not bring any inherent value to governing the country, and were simply being controlled by the European foreigners.
Following World War I, Belgium was granted rule over Rwanda. The popular trends of eugenics and biological racism in Europe and the United States were introduced and enforced in many colonies. In particular, Belgium sought to identify the biological and racial differences between Tutsis and Hutus, subjecting tens-of-thousands of Rwandans to tests and measurements by European scientists. Following 1935, racialist ideology was standardized and normalized with the introduction of ethnic identity cards. Before the arrival of Europeans, social groups were more fluid with wealth and vocation defining one’s class. Following European rule, an unfounded racial divide was developed and instrumentalized for the purpose of colonization. These factors contribute to a growing historical and ethnic conflict that plagues Rwanda to this day.
In contrast, the majority of today’s Congo was never ruled by centralized kingdoms. King Leopold II of Belgium created the corporate state the Congo Free State in 1885 without the knowledge of most of its inhabitants that were spread across the region, mostly living in local groups. For 23 years, the Congo was plundered, rebellions from various local groups were put down, and little development took place that wasn’t geared toward resource extraction. An estimated10 million people(half of the total population) were killed or died from starvation and disease. In 1908, Belgium took control of Congo from Leopold, following an international outcry and activism mission to bring to light the ruthless violence ordered by King Leopold and his personal gain from the colony. Though executions and mutilations were put to an end, the country was largely privatized and exploited for its natural resources and fertile land. Each region was administered individually and became specialized based on the type of economy it was best suited for (mineral extraction, plantations, etc.).
Shortly after the DRC’s independence, military leader Mobutu Sese Seko led a coup d’état with the support of Belgian forces against the first democratically-elected leader, Patrice Lumumba (feared to be left-leaning or an outright communist). Seko would rule for 32 years through kleptocracry, nepotism, public executions, consolidation of the military, establishing a single-party state, and support from Western countries. Despite the well-known use of coercion, execution, and a multitude of human rights violations, Western states (namely the United States) supported Seko’s government for access to the valuable uranium deposits used for producing nuclear weapons in the Cold War arms race. The democracies of the West overlooked Seko’s dictatorship and even outright supported it in the fight against international communism. As dictator, Seko severely mismanaged the economy and caused massive inflation, enriching himself and his ruling circle in the face of mass poverty of Congolese citizens. He enticed foreign companies by limiting taxes and royalties on extracting natural resources. Continued poverty and low quality of life came in the wake of Congo’s size, historically undeveloped infrastructure, and lack of government programs and robust policy to support civilians. Pervasive corruption and continuous warfare have hindered the nation’s prospects for economic development and democratic representation.
UN INTERVENTION
The UN peacekeeping forces first entered the conflict following the ceasefire in 1993 during the Rwandan Civil War, as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). When the genocide was unleashed a year later, the UNAMIR was completely unprepared, and due to its limited mandate, did not take measures to defend the Tutsi minority or end the attacks. Many countries supporting the mission requested to back-out and allow Rwanda to deal with its internal crisis alone. UN and international action was too little and too late; as the details of events emerged in the aftermath, the UN intervention was recognized as deeply flawed and an overall failure.
Areportby the Centre for Systemic Peace has documented that as the Cold War came to an end “post-formation instability” increased significantly. It points to the increase of media coverage and proliferation of light weapons following the Cold War. While South Africa stabilized and rebounded politically, Central and Eastern Africa “remain highly unstable and volatile.” In July of 1999, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established to observe the ceasefire signed between the DRC, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These countries have been affected by neighbourhood spillover effects (large refugee and displaced populations), issues in leadership succession and mismanagement of the state. In early 2000, the main goals were established in UN Security Council Resolution 1291. They included: liaison between the warring parties, ensuring the disengagement and deployment of armed forces, observing breaches to the ceasefire, and supporting the exchange of prisoners of war. Between 2000 and 2004, the peacekeepers worked to end violence emanating from the central provinces and moving eastwards. Each year the mandate expanded slightly and the maximum number of military forces was increased. Following the end of the Second Congo War in 2003, theUNSC Resolution 1565authorized 5,900 additional forces to be deployed in the areas of North and South Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Burundi. The modified mandate of R1565, which continues to today, includes: contributing to the pacification and general improvement of security in the country, providing support for conflict resolution in politically volatile areas, and improving border security – patrolling and monitoring of the arms embargo.
In 2010, MONUC was replaced with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo (MONUSCO), highlighting the reduction of conflict and new period of stabilization in the country. The mandate focuses on protecting civilians, humanitarian personnel, and human rights defenders from imminent physical violence and supporting the government in its stabilization and peace consolidation. In 2013, an “intervention brigade” was created, lasting two years, to neutralize armed groups that opposed the state and endangered civilians’ security. The troop ceiling reached its highest point of 19,815 soldiers, and in March 2017 was reduced to 16,215. Though it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of UN involvement, it is more difficult to imagine an alternative force that could intervene in a responsible and organized manner. Had pacification and stabilization of the country been left to the Congolese government, their success would be severely limited by available resources, undeveloped infrastructure and training of personnel. It would also likely have involved a greater loss of life and human rights violations.
BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY
The DRC and Rwanda’s long road to democracy has not taken an ideal or practical course. Rwandans and Congolese have been subjected to rule by force, authoritarianism, and corrupt governments. A transition to democratic institutions and principles will not be easy; democracy is bureaucratic, time-consuming, and easily degenerates into populism and majority rule. Without a strong economy and incentives to participate, the average citizen in these countries will focus on pursuing more immediate needs, such as food, housing, and education, and rightfully so. Without proof that democratic representation will actually take their views into consideration and prioritize their needs, civilians will remain suspect of democratic institutions. Most of all, officials in government must respect the separation of powers and branches of government that protect against one-man rule, corruption, and treason. Will Paul Kagame and Joseph Kabila have the prudence to relinquish power as democratic institutions require? Will they realize that staying in power damages rather than improves their countries and the foundation of their governments? More importantly, will other representatives come together to denounce power-grabbing presidents and will a transition be achieved without bloodshed or military suppression? These are the questions of the day, the answers to which will determine the fate of democracy in Rwanda and the Congo.

Title: DRC: Populations at Risk - Imminent Risk (15 August 2017) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
Populations in the eastern and Kasaï regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain at imminent risk of possible mass atrocity crimes as a result of ongoing violence between security forces and various militias.
BACKGROUND:
Violence resulting from tensions between the government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a local militia following the killing of their chief, Kamuina Nsapu, has resulted in atrocities perpetrated against populations in Kasaï, Kasaï Central and Kasaï Oriental provinces since August 2016. Inter-ethnic tensions have become a dominant characteristic of the conflict and the Catholic Church in the DRC has reported over 3,000 people have been killed. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), of the 3.7 million internally displaced persons in the DRC, over 1.3 million are in the Kasaï region.
The UN Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC (UNJHRO) has found at least 80 mass graves in the Kasaï region since January, many of which have been attributed to the government's armed forces (FARDC). On 4 August the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report implicating the FARDC and local government officials in actively fomenting ethnic violence in the Kasaï region and in supporting the formation of another militia, Bana Mura.
OHCHR has noted that the Kamuina Nsapu militia has perpetrated atrocities against civilians and that the FARDC has used disproportionate force in its response, with both sides committing extrajudicial and targeted killings. The UN has also documented hundreds of children being used as combatants or human shields by Kamuina Nsapu, as well as sexual violence perpetrated against young girls. Meanwhile, since late March, Bana Mura has targeted populations based upon ethnicity, mutilated women and children, and destroyed villages that allegedly support Kamuina Nsapu. On 2 June the UN's stabilization mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) reported at least 639 schools and a number of health centers in the Kasaï region have been destroyed or attacked during fighting.
Other armed groups continue to utilize ongoing instability and the weakness of state authority in eastern DRC to attack security forces and perpetrate crimes against civilians. Such groups – including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and various Mayi-Mayi militias – have been operating in the DRC for more than 20 years. Despite offensives conducted by the FARDC with assistance from MONUSCO and its force intervention brigade, attacks by militias, as well as inter-communal violence, continue to threaten vulnerable populations in North Kivu, South Kivu, Tanganyika and Katanga. The FARDC and MONUSCO reported an increase in attacks by Mayi-Mayi militias in the Kivus since June.
The risk of political violence as a result of the postponed 2016 elections also remains high. Security forces have been accused of using excessive force during demonstrations on 19 September and 20 December – the day after President Joseph Kabila's constitutional mandate ended. UNJHRO recorded 48 civilians killed during the September demonstrations and more than 40 people killed during December.
As a result of a failure to hold elections during 2016, on 1 September a national dialogue was launched to ensure a peaceful political process. Additional mediation between the government and opposition took place under the aegis of the Conference Episcopale du Congo (CENCO). On 31 December the CENCO negotiations resulted in an agreement calling for elections to be held during 2017 and for President Kabila to abstain from seeking a third term. Negotiations on implementation met several complications, resulting in CENCO withdrawing from the process. The government has since declared it lacks the capacity to hold elections in 2017.
ANALYSIS:
Rising tensions in areas that have been relatively calm in recent years, including the Kasaïs, is indicative of the enduring challenge of preventing the emergence of armed groups opposed to the rule of the central government. The growth in inter-ethnic violence in the Kasaï region and evidence implicating the government in attacks targeting certain ethnic groups increases the risk of further atrocities in the region. The situation in the Kasaïs is also creating an enormous humanitarian crisis, placing additional strain on a country that was already home to over 2 million IDPs and tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries.
Competition for control of profitable minerals, as well as underlying conflict between communities that consider themselves indigenous and those perceived as outsiders, has enabled the proliferation of armed groups in the DRC. Such groups will continue to emerge even after the eradication of the ADF, FDLR, Kamuina Nsapu and other Mayi-Mayi militias if these issues are not resolved.
The government has often failed to hold members of the FARDC accountable for systematic human rights violations. Despite diplomatic pressure from the international community, the government has not undertaken a meaningful investigation into allegations that hundreds of people have been killed by the FARDC in the Kasaï region.
Growing government repression and the population's frustration with the unconstitutional delay in elections enhances the risk of deadly violence. The government must take meaningful steps towards ensuring a timely and peaceful transition of power in the DRC, including implementation of the CENCO agreement.
The government of the DRC has struggled to uphold its Responsibility to Protect and its own forces have been complicit in some previous mass atrocity crimes. The DRC needs ongoing international support to prevent recurring violence.
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE:
On 31 March 2017 the UN Security Council (UNSC) extended MONUSCO's mandate until March 2018, emphasizing that the DRC government "bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including protection from crimes against humanity and war crimes." The resolution reduced MONUSCO's troop ceiling from 19,815 to 16,215 despite mounting security challenges.
On 19 April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein, called for an immediate, impartial international investigation following the discovery of additional mass graves by UNJHRO. During May the High Commissioner gave the government an 8 June deadline to establish a credible investigation, which it failed to meet. On 23 June the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution mandating the High Commissioner appoint a team of international experts to collect and preserve evidence to determine responsibility for possible atrocities perpetrated in the Kasaï region.
On 31 May the European Union imposed sanctions on nine individuals with "command and control" responsibility for security forces involved in deadly violence against protestors. The following day the United States issued sanctions against François Olenga for command responsibility of the Republican Guard during violence against the political opposition in Kinshasa. The UNSC also currently subjects 9 entities and 31 individuals connected to armed groups in the eastern DRC to sanctions.
On 27 July the UNSC issued a Presidential Statement calling upon parties to the 31 December CENCO agreement to remain committed to its implementation. The UNSC also condemned the violence in the Kasaï region.
NECESSARY ACTION:
The DRC government and MONUSCO must ensure that protecting civilians remains their primary priority as they address the ongoing threat posed by various armed groups in both the Kasaï and eastern regions. The government must halt support for Bana Mura and condemn the targeting of civilians based upon ethnicity.
The government must urgently address allegations of the security forces using disproportionate and deadly force against protestors and ensure accountability for the unlawful killing of civilians. The FARDC must not permit individuals who have previously committed atrocities to join its forces and should train all recruits in the protection of civilians, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.
The government must fully cooperate with the Human Rights Council-mandated international team of experts, providing access to all relevant sites and also establishing a credible domestic investigative mechanism. If the government fails to fulfill its promises in this regard, the International Criminal Court and UNSC should be prepared to act to ensure accountability.
In keeping with the CENCO agreement, the government and opposition must recommit to an agreed election timetable and a peaceful transition of power.

Title: Power Traps and Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa – MIR
The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs
Nearly every nation in Sub-Saharan Africa has faced power traps and institutional instability since their independence from European colonialism. Over the past four decades, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confronted both internal crises and constant external threats. The two nations have been intertwined in ethnic and political conflict since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when nearly 2 million Hutufledto eastern Congo fearing reprisal from the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) that retook the government.
TESTING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
On August 4th, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda wasreelectedto office for his third term, winning over 98% of the vote.An amendmentto the constitution allowing for Kagame to run for a third term was introduced in 2015 following a popular petition that received 3.7 million signatures (more than 60% of registered voters). Though Kagame is popular for his role in economic reform, improving healthcare and education, and reducing internal violence in Rwanda, there are major concerns that he is stamping outopposition movementsand that there is no protected space for other parties to develop. One opposition party, FDU-Inkingi, has been outlawed and its candidate in the 2010 election is serving a 15-year prison sentence for threatening national security. In addition, the Green Party’s Vice President was beheaded in 2010, leading up to the election. In this year’s election, most other parties did not put forward a candidate, supporting Kagame based on his successful policy and broad national popularity.
The DRC, far larger and varied in comparison, has over a dozen active parties and the incumbent is an independent. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, two successful democratic elections have taken place since its latest revision of the constitution in 2006. Joseph Kabila was elected in 2006 and reelected in 2011, but in 2016 was due to be replaced in a national election due to the established term limits. However, in September of 2016, the electoral commissionannouncedthat the election would be postponed to 2018 because a census was needed for the proper implementation of the election. The announcement caused international concern for the future of Congo’s juvenile democratic institutions and roused internal protest and conflict with opposition leaders, familiar with the modus operandi of the power-grabbing presidents of the past.
AFRICA’S WORLD WAR
Approximately 5 million people perished in the conflict between 1994 and 2003 often referred to asAfrica’s World War, in which soldiers from nine different countries clashed on Congolese soil. In 1996, theFirst Congo Warofficially began when Rwanda and Uganda invaded eastern Zaire (later the DRC) to stamp out perpetrators of the genocide and eliminate any threat of an invading Hutu force. Laurant Kabila overthrew the infamous ruling dictator Mobutu Sese Seko with the support of the two armies. He became president in 1997 and soon after ordered the two armies out of the Congo, fearing that Rwanda and Uganda would seize the mineral-rich areas of eastern DRC. Kabila received support from a number of regional partners, including Angola and Zimbabwe, in theSecond Congo War, as Rwanda accused Kabila of ambivalence toward rooting out the Hutu rebels. In 2001 Laurant Kabila was assassinated, but his son Joseph Kabila was appointed president in his place. The conflict officially came to a close in 2003, but rebel groups with various aims and allegiances have endured in eastern Congo.
A persisting trend in the conflict is Rwanda’s clandestine support of Congolese rebel groups that seek to overthrow or secede from Congo’s government and put an end to Hutu rebel groups operating in the DRC. In 2008, however, Congo and Rwanda led an assault against the Hutu rebels, ending a proxy war between Tutsi (the National Congress for the Defense of the People – CNDP) and Hutu (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda – FDLR) war bands in eastern Congo. As part of the agreement the CNDP split in 2009, with half of the group integrating into the Congolese national army and the other half resisting, forming the new rebel group M23 in 2012. The leader of M23, Bosco Ntaganda, surrendered to the International Criminal Court’s custody in 2013.
This has not spelled the end of conflict in the vast region of eastern Congo, as a handful of rebel groups continue to war with different governments, each with varying aims: the FDLR continues to operate, 2,000 combatants strong; the Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), made up of 500 Islamists, seeks to initiate Shari’a Law in Uganda; the Ugandan Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) is led by cult leader and self-proclaimed prophet Joseph Kony, who seeks Christian rule in Uganda; the Burundian National Liberation Forces (FNL) is a Hutu rebel group in alliance with FDLR and Mai-Mai Yakutumba; and various Mai-Mai militias, numbering six in total.
ROOTS OF INTERNAL CRISIS AND INSTABILITY
The issues that plague Rwanda and Congo are very different in nature. Foreign forces ruled Rwanda for nearly a century, first the German Empire and then Belgium. Before German colonization, there was a strongly centralized government that stretched over today’s Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. Hutu and Tutsi mostly shared rule until the 18thcentury when the Hutus in administrative and bureaucratic positions began to lose power and become marginalized. Hutus, which made up the large majority of the population (an estimated 85%), were mainly known for cultivation while the minority Tutsi were known as pastoralists, owning valuable cattle. As the centralization of the kingdom continued, land was distributed to individuals rather than through lineage groups (which would favour the Hutu majority), and thus Tutsi chiefs were increasingly selected. This led to increased inequality between the groups.
The social and political dynamics only worsened with German indirect rule, as Tutsi political power became entrenched with the support of the Germans. The Germans believed that the Tutsi were purer and the closest ethnic group to Europeans, introducing a racialist ideology that did not exist before European intervention. With the introduction of money, individual taxes, and larger organizing capitalist forces, the power-distance and influence of Tutsis began to decrease. It became clear that the Tutsis did not bring any inherent value to governing the country, and were simply being controlled by the European foreigners.
Following World War I, Belgium was granted rule over Rwanda. The popular trends of eugenics and biological racism in Europe and the United States were introduced and enforced in many colonies. In particular, Belgium sought to identify the biological and racial differences between Tutsis and Hutus, subjecting tens-of-thousands of Rwandans to tests and measurements by European scientists. Following 1935, racialist ideology was standardized and normalized with the introduction of ethnic identity cards. Before the arrival of Europeans, social groups were more fluid with wealth and vocation defining one’s class. Following European rule, an unfounded racial divide was developed and instrumentalized for the purpose of colonization. These factors contribute to a growing historical and ethnic conflict that plagues Rwanda to this day.
In contrast, the majority of today’s Congo was never ruled by centralized kingdoms. King Leopold II of Belgium created the corporate state the Congo Free State in 1885 without the knowledge of most of its inhabitants that were spread across the region, mostly living in local groups. For 23 years, the Congo was plundered, rebellions from various local groups were put down, and little development took place that wasn’t geared toward resource extraction. An estimated10 million people(half of the total population) were killed or died from starvation and disease. In 1908, Belgium took control of Congo from Leopold, following an international outcry and activism mission to bring to light the ruthless violence ordered by King Leopold and his personal gain from the colony. Though executions and mutilations were put to an end, the country was largely privatized and exploited for its natural resources and fertile land. Each region was administered individually and became specialized based on the type of economy it was best suited for (mineral extraction, plantations, etc.).
Shortly after the DRC’s independence, military leader Mobutu Sese Seko led a coup d’état with the support of Belgian forces against the first democratically-elected leader, Patrice Lumumba (feared to be left-leaning or an outright communist). Seko would rule for 32 years through kleptocracry, nepotism, public executions, consolidation of the military, establishing a single-party state, and support from Western countries. Despite the well-known use of coercion, execution, and a multitude of human rights violations, Western states (namely the United States) supported Seko’s government for access to the valuable uranium deposits used for producing nuclear weapons in the Cold War arms race. The democracies of the West overlooked Seko’s dictatorship and even outright supported it in the fight against international communism. As dictator, Seko severely mismanaged the economy and caused massive inflation, enriching himself and his ruling circle in the face of mass poverty of Congolese citizens. He enticed foreign companies by limiting taxes and royalties on extracting natural resources. Continued poverty and low quality of life came in the wake of Congo’s size, historically undeveloped infrastructure, and lack of government programs and robust policy to support civilians. Pervasive corruption and continuous warfare have hindered the nation’s prospects for economic development and democratic representation.
UN INTERVENTION
The UN peacekeeping forces first entered the conflict following the ceasefire in 1993 during the Rwandan Civil War, as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). When the genocide was unleashed a year later, the UNAMIR was completely unprepared, and due to its limited mandate, did not take measures to defend the Tutsi minority or end the attacks. Many countries supporting the mission requested to back-out and allow Rwanda to deal with its internal crisis alone. UN and international action was too little and too late; as the details of events emerged in the aftermath, the UN intervention was recognized as deeply flawed and an overall failure.
Areportby the Centre for Systemic Peace has documented that as the Cold War came to an end “post-formation instability” increased significantly. It points to the increase of media coverage and proliferation of light weapons following the Cold War. While South Africa stabilized and rebounded politically, Central and Eastern Africa “remain highly unstable and volatile.” In July of 1999, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established to observe the ceasefire signed between the DRC, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These countries have been affected by neighbourhood spillover effects (large refugee and displaced populations), issues in leadership succession and mismanagement of the state. In early 2000, the main goals were established in UN Security Council Resolution 1291. They included: liaison between the warring parties, ensuring the disengagement and deployment of armed forces, observing breaches to the ceasefire, and supporting the exchange of prisoners of war. Between 2000 and 2004, the peacekeepers worked to end violence emanating from the central provinces and moving eastwards. Each year the mandate expanded slightly and the maximum number of military forces was increased. Following the end of the Second Congo War in 2003, theUNSC Resolution 1565authorized 5,900 additional forces to be deployed in the areas of North and South Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Burundi. The modified mandate of R1565, which continues to today, includes: contributing to the pacification and general improvement of security in the country, providing support for conflict resolution in politically volatile areas, and improving border security – patrolling and monitoring of the arms embargo.
In 2010, MONUC was replaced with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo (MONUSCO), highlighting the reduction of conflict and new period of stabilization in the country. The mandate focuses on protecting civilians, humanitarian personnel, and human rights defenders from imminent physical violence and supporting the government in its stabilization and peace consolidation. In 2013, an “intervention brigade” was created, lasting two years, to neutralize armed groups that opposed the state and endangered civilians’ security. The troop ceiling reached its highest point of 19,815 soldiers, and in March 2017 was reduced to 16,215. Though it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of UN involvement, it is more difficult to imagine an alternative force that could intervene in a responsible and organized manner. Had pacification and stabilization of the country been left to the Congolese government, their success would be severely limited by available resources, undeveloped infrastructure and training of personnel. It would also likely have involved a greater loss of life and human rights violations.
BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY
The DRC and Rwanda’s long road to democracy has not taken an ideal or practical course. Rwandans and Congolese have been subjected to rule by force, authoritarianism, and corrupt governments. A transition to democratic institutions and principles will not be easy; democracy is bureaucratic, time-consuming, and easily degenerates into populism and majority rule. Without a strong economy and incentives to participate, the average citizen in these countries will focus on pursuing more immediate needs, such as food, housing, and education, and rightfully so. Without proof that democratic representation will actually take their views into consideration and prioritize their needs, civilians will remain suspect of democratic institutions. Most of all, officials in government must respect the separation of powers and branches of government that protect against one-man rule, corruption, and treason. Will Paul Kagame and Joseph Kabila have the prudence to relinquish power as democratic institutions require? Will they realize that staying in power damages rather than improves their countries and the foundation of their governments? More importantly, will other representatives come together to denounce power-grabbing presidents and will a transition be achieved without bloodshed or military suppression? These are the questions of the day, the answers to which will determine the fate of democracy in Rwanda and the Congo.

The United Nations General Assembly has approved $6.8 billion in peacekeeping expenditures for the 2017/18 budget year. This total will increase, possibly to as much as$7.3 billion, since states only agreed on the first six months of funding for two ongoing operations. Yet even that total would still be some $600 million less than the amount requested by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and $500 million less than the approved resources for the previous year.
United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley hascelebrated this reduction: “Just five months into our time here, we’ve already been able to cut over half a billion dollars from the U.N. peacekeeping budget and we’re only getting started.” The UN’s Africa Grouphas warned, however, that excessive budget cuts would “endanger the implementation of [mission] mandates.”

This potentially effective unit is being hamstrung by politics and concerns about using force in peace operations.
The Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), the sharp end of MONUSCO – the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – earned its stripes in 2013 when it helped the DRC’s army defeat the powerful Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in the east of the country.
But not a lot has been heard about the FIB since, though it has remained deployed in the eastern part of the country for four years. What has it been doing?
The unit of some 3 000 troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi has a more muscular mission than the rest of MONUSCO to use necessary force to ‘neutralise’ all the ‘negative’ armed rebel groups in eastern DRC. Its second target was supposed to be the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the armed group founded in the mid-1990s by Rwandan Hutus who fled the country after the genocide against the Tutsis.
The attention of the world has recently been focused on the humanitarian tragedy of the violent conflict being pursued by various armed groups in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), specifically since the rapid advance during November 2012 of the rebel group known as the March 23 Movement (M23) that operates mainly in the Congolese province of North Kivu.
M23 managed to capture the regional Congolese capital of Goma on 20 November 2012 after the withdrawal of about 2 000 soldiers from the Congolese National Army (FARDC) and 700 Congolese policemen. Goma fell to the rebel group despite the presence of nearly 6 000 armed peacekeepers in the North Kivu province, over 1 500 in the Goma area alone, under the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). This included a battalion of 850 South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers, all deployed under a United Nations (UN) Security Council mandate written in terms of Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, which allows the use of ‘coercive measures’ (force) in support of mission objectives. With nearly 2 000 000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in the Eastern DRC and the UN reporting that it had lost access to 30 of 31 IDP camps, international intervention was clearly needed.

Title: DRC: Populations at Risk - Imminent Risk (15 August 2017) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
Populations in the eastern and Kasaï regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain at imminent risk of possible mass atrocity crimes as a result of ongoing violence between security forces and various militias.
BACKGROUND:
Violence resulting from tensions between the government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a local militia following the killing of their chief, Kamuina Nsapu, has resulted in atrocities perpetrated against populations in Kasaï, Kasaï Central and Kasaï Oriental provinces since August 2016. Inter-ethnic tensions have become a dominant characteristic of the conflict and the Catholic Church in the DRC has reported over 3,000 people have been killed. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), of the 3.7 million internally displaced persons in the DRC, over 1.3 million are in the Kasaï region.
The UN Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC (UNJHRO) has found at least 80 mass graves in the Kasaï region since January, many of which have been attributed to the government's armed forces (FARDC). On 4 August the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report implicating the FARDC and local government officials in actively fomenting ethnic violence in the Kasaï region and in supporting the formation of another militia, Bana Mura.
OHCHR has noted that the Kamuina Nsapu militia has perpetrated atrocities against civilians and that the FARDC has used disproportionate force in its response, with both sides committing extrajudicial and targeted killings. The UN has also documented hundreds of children being used as combatants or human shields by Kamuina Nsapu, as well as sexual violence perpetrated against young girls. Meanwhile, since late March, Bana Mura has targeted populations based upon ethnicity, mutilated women and children, and destroyed villages that allegedly support Kamuina Nsapu. On 2 June the UN's stabilization mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) reported at least 639 schools and a number of health centers in the Kasaï region have been destroyed or attacked during fighting.
Other armed groups continue to utilize ongoing instability and the weakness of state authority in eastern DRC to attack security forces and perpetrate crimes against civilians. Such groups – including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and various Mayi-Mayi militias – have been operating in the DRC for more than 20 years. Despite offensives conducted by the FARDC with assistance from MONUSCO and its force intervention brigade, attacks by militias, as well as inter-communal violence, continue to threaten vulnerable populations in North Kivu, South Kivu, Tanganyika and Katanga. The FARDC and MONUSCO reported an increase in attacks by Mayi-Mayi militias in the Kivus since June.
The risk of political violence as a result of the postponed 2016 elections also remains high. Security forces have been accused of using excessive force during demonstrations on 19 September and 20 December – the day after President Joseph Kabila's constitutional mandate ended. UNJHRO recorded 48 civilians killed during the September demonstrations and more than 40 people killed during December.
As a result of a failure to hold elections during 2016, on 1 September a national dialogue was launched to ensure a peaceful political process. Additional mediation between the government and opposition took place under the aegis of the Conference Episcopale du Congo (CENCO). On 31 December the CENCO negotiations resulted in an agreement calling for elections to be held during 2017 and for President Kabila to abstain from seeking a third term. Negotiations on implementation met several complications, resulting in CENCO withdrawing from the process. The government has since declared it lacks the capacity to hold elections in 2017.
ANALYSIS:
Rising tensions in areas that have been relatively calm in recent years, including the Kasaïs, is indicative of the enduring challenge of preventing the emergence of armed groups opposed to the rule of the central government. The growth in inter-ethnic violence in the Kasaï region and evidence implicating the government in attacks targeting certain ethnic groups increases the risk of further atrocities in the region. The situation in the Kasaïs is also creating an enormous humanitarian crisis, placing additional strain on a country that was already home to over 2 million IDPs and tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries.
Competition for control of profitable minerals, as well as underlying conflict between communities that consider themselves indigenous and those perceived as outsiders, has enabled the proliferation of armed groups in the DRC. Such groups will continue to emerge even after the eradication of the ADF, FDLR, Kamuina Nsapu and other Mayi-Mayi militias if these issues are not resolved.
The government has often failed to hold members of the FARDC accountable for systematic human rights violations. Despite diplomatic pressure from the international community, the government has not undertaken a meaningful investigation into allegations that hundreds of people have been killed by the FARDC in the Kasaï region.
Growing government repression and the population's frustration with the unconstitutional delay in elections enhances the risk of deadly violence. The government must take meaningful steps towards ensuring a timely and peaceful transition of power in the DRC, including implementation of the CENCO agreement.
The government of the DRC has struggled to uphold its Responsibility to Protect and its own forces have been complicit in some previous mass atrocity crimes. The DRC needs ongoing international support to prevent recurring violence.

ROOTS OF INTERNAL CRISIS AND INSTABILITY
The issues that plague Rwanda and Congo are very different in nature. Foreign forces ruled Rwanda for nearly a century, first the German Empire and then Belgium. Before German colonization, there was a strongly centralized government that stretched over today’s Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. Hutu and Tutsi mostly shared rule until the 18thcentury when the Hutus in administrative and bureaucratic positions began to lose power and become marginalized. Hutus, which made up the large majority of the population (an estimated 85%), were mainly known for cultivation while the minority Tutsi were known as pastoralists, owning valuable cattle. As the centralization of the kingdom continued, land was distributed to individuals rather than through lineage groups (which would favour the Hutu majority), and thus Tutsi chiefs were increasingly selected. This led to increased inequality between the groups.
The social and political dynamics only worsened with German indirect rule, as Tutsi political power became entrenched with the support of the Germans. The Germans believed that the Tutsi were purer and the closest ethnic group to Europeans, introducing a racialist ideology that did not exist before European intervention. With the introduction of money, individual taxes, and larger organizing capitalist forces, the power-distance and influence of Tutsis began to decrease. It became clear that the Tutsis did not bring any inherent value to governing the country, and were simply being controlled by the European foreigners.
Following World War I, Belgium was granted rule over Rwanda. The popular trends of eugenics and biological racism in Europe and the United States were introduced and enforced in many colonies. In particular, Belgium sought to identify the biological and racial differences between Tutsis and Hutus, subjecting tens-of-thousands of Rwandans to tests and measurements by European scientists. Following 1935, racialist ideology was standardized and normalized with the introduction of ethnic identity cards. Before the arrival of Europeans, social groups were more fluid with wealth and vocation defining one’s class. Following European rule, an unfounded racial divide was developed and instrumentalized for the purpose of colonization. These factors contribute to a growing historical and ethnic conflict that plagues Rwanda to this day.
In contrast, the majority of today’s Congo was never ruled by centralized kingdoms. King Leopold II of Belgium created the corporate state the Congo Free State in 1885 without the knowledge of most of its inhabitants that were spread across the region, mostly living in local groups. For 23 years, the Congo was plundered, rebellions from various local groups were put down, and little development took place that wasn’t geared toward resource extraction. An estimated10 million people(half of the total population) were killed or died from starvation and disease. In 1908, Belgium took control of Congo from Leopold, following an international outcry and activism mission to bring to light the ruthless violence ordered by King Leopold and his personal gain from the colony. Though executions and mutilations were put to an end, the country was largely privatized and exploited for its natural resources and fertile land. Each region was administered individually and became specialized based on the type of economy it was best suited for (mineral extraction, plantations, etc.).
Shortly after the DRC’s independence, military leader Mobutu Sese Seko led a coup d’état with the support of Belgian forces against the first democratically-elected leader, Patrice Lumumba (feared to be left-leaning or an outright communist). Seko would rule for 32 years through kleptocracry, nepotism, public executions, consolidation of the military, establishing a single-party state, and support from Western countries. Despite the well-known use of coercion, execution, and a multitude of human rights violations, Western states (namely the United States) supported Seko’s government for access to the valuable uranium deposits used for producing nuclear weapons in the Cold War arms race. The democracies of the West overlooked Seko’s dictatorship and even outright supported it in the fight against international communism. As dictator, Seko severely mismanaged the economy and caused massive inflation, enriching himself and his ruling circle in the face of mass poverty of Congolese citizens. He enticed foreign companies by limiting taxes and royalties on extracting natural resources. Continued poverty and low quality of life came in the wake of Congo’s size, historically undeveloped infrastructure, and lack of government programs and robust policy to support civilians. Pervasive corruption and continuous warfare have hindered the nation’s prospects for economic development and democratic representation.
UN INTERVENTION
The UN peacekeeping forces first entered the conflict following the ceasefire in 1993 during the Rwandan Civil War, as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). When the genocide was unleashed a year later, the UNAMIR was completely unprepared, and due to its limited mandate, did not take measures to defend the Tutsi minority or end the attacks. Many countries supporting the mission requested to back-out and allow Rwanda to deal with its internal crisis alone. UN and international action was too little and too late; as the details of events emerged in the aftermath, the UN intervention was recognized as deeply flawed and an overall failure.
Areportby the Centre for Systemic Peace has documented that as the Cold War came to an end “post-formation instability” increased significantly. It points to the increase of media coverage and proliferation of light weapons following the Cold War. While South Africa stabilized and rebounded politically, Central and Eastern Africa “remain highly unstable and volatile.” In July of 1999, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established to observe the ceasefire signed between the DRC, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These countries have been affected by neighbourhood spillover effects (large refugee and displaced populations), issues in leadership succession and mismanagement of the state. In early 2000, the main goals were established in UN Security Council Resolution 1291. They included: liaison between the warring parties, ensuring the disengagement and deployment of armed forces, observing breaches to the ceasefire, and supporting the exchange of prisoners of war. Between 2000 and 2004, the peacekeepers worked to end violence emanating from the central provinces and moving eastwards. Each year the mandate expanded slightly and the maximum number of military forces was increased. Following the end of the Second Congo War in 2003, theUNSC Resolution 1565authorized 5,900 additional forces to be deployed in the areas of North and South Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Burundi. The modified mandate of R1565, which continues to today, includes: contributing to the pacification and general improvement of security in the country, providing support for conflict resolution in politically volatile areas, and improving border security – patrolling and monitoring of the arms embargo.
In 2010, MONUC was replaced with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo (MONUSCO), highlighting the reduction of conflict and new period of stabilization in the country. The mandate focuses on protecting civilians, humanitarian personnel, and human rights defenders from imminent physical violence and supporting the government in its stabilization and peace consolidation. In 2013, an “intervention brigade” was created, lasting two years, to neutralize armed groups that opposed the state and endangered civilians’ security. The troop ceiling reached its highest point of 19,815 soldiers, and in March 2017 was reduced to 16,215. Though it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of UN involvement, it is more difficult to imagine an alternative force that could intervene in a responsible and organized manner. Had pacification and stabilization of the country been left to the Congolese government, their success would be severely limited by available resources, undeveloped infrastructure and training of personnel. It would also likely have involved a greater loss of life and human rights violations.
BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY
The DRC and Rwanda’s long road to democracy has not taken an ideal or practical course. Rwandans and Congolese have been subjected to rule by force, authoritarianism, and corrupt governments. A transition to democratic institutions and principles will not be easy; democracy is bureaucratic, time-consuming, and easily degenerates into populism and majority rule. Without a strong economy and incentives to participate, the average citizen in these countries will focus on pursuing more immediate needs, such as food, housing, and education, and rightfully so. Without proof that democratic representation will actually take their views into consideration and prioritize their needs, civilians will remain suspect of democratic institutions. Most of all, officials in government must respect the separation of powers and branches of government that protect against one-man rule, corruption, and treason. Will Paul Kagame and Joseph Kabila have the prudence to relinquish power as democratic institutions require? Will they realize that staying in power damages rather than improves their countries and the foundation of their governments? More importantly, will other representatives come together to denounce power-grabbing presidents and will a transition be achieved without bloodshed or military suppression? These are the questions of the day, the answers to which will determine the fate of democracy in Rwanda and the Congo.

Title: Drc Violence
DRCmay refer to:
TheDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a country located in Central Africa.
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, often abbreviated toDRC, is an estate inBurgundy,Francethat produces white and redwine. It is widely considered among the world's greatest wine producers, and DRC bottles are among the world's most expensive. It takes its name from the domaine's most famous vineyard,Romanée-Conti.
In 1232, the Abbey of Saint Vivant in Vosne acquired 1.8 hectares of vineyard. In 1631 it was bought by the de Croonembourg family, who renamed it Romanée for reasons unknown. At the same time they acquired the adjacent vineyard of La Tâche.
In 1760, André de Croonembourg decided to sell the domaine and it became the subject of a bidding war betweenMadame de Pompadour, mistress ofLouis XV of France, and her bitter enemy Louis François Ier de Bourbon, prince de Conti. The prince won, paying the massive sum of 8000livres, and the vineyard became known as Romanée-Conti. But come the Revolution, the prince's land was seized and auctioned off.
The Romanée-Conti vineyard was bought by Nicolas Defer de la Nouerre, who in 1819 sold it to Julien Ouvrard for 78,000 francs. In 1869 it was bought by Jacques-Marie Duvault-Blochet, who went on to build the domaine we know today with the acquisition of the holdings inÉchezeaux,Grands ÉchezeauxandRichebourg.
Mystis a franchise centered on a series ofadventurevideo games. The first game in the series,Myst, was released in 1993 by brothersRandandRobyn Millerand their video game companyCyan, Inc.Riven, the sequel toMyst, was released in 1997, and was followed by three more direct sequels:Myst III: Exilein 2001,Myst IV: Revelationin 2004, andMyst V: End of Agesin 2005. A spinoff featuring a multiplayer component,Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, was released in 2003 and followed by twoexpansion packs.
Myst's story concerns an explorer namedAtruswho has the ability to write books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This practice of creating linking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as theStrangerand assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.
Violenceis defined by theWorld Health Organizationas "the intentional use of physical force orpower, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional meaning of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).
The most prevalent cause of death in interpersonal violence is assault with afirearm(180,000), followed by a sharp object (114,000). Other means contribute to another 110,000 deaths.
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such asconcentrated poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence.

Violenceis aparodyof conventional dungeon-bashing games, set in a contemporary metropolis whereplayer charactersdash from room to room killing the occupants and stealing their belongings. In a style reminiscent ofMad, it is relentlessly user-hostile, taking time out to insult the reader wherever possible (it opens with the words, "Welcome toViolence, you degraded turd") and uses a system where the user can buy experience points for cash from the designer or publisher. Despite innovative game design and exhaustive lists of equipment and weapons (including both belt and orbital sanders), monster types and possible scenarios, it is largely and deliberately unplayable because of an exhaustive rule-set. The rule-set provides information on a range of things related to killing. Weapons, combat styles, and the like are intricately detailed, considering the short length of the volume.Violenceis a rant against the traditional styles ofDungeons & Dragons,MMORPGs, and theGrand Theft Autoseries, written to simultaneously annoy, enrage and challenge the reader. As a game, it is of little value, but is useful as an insight into the mindset of its author and an indictment of an endemic style of role-playing.
Violence, orViolence: Six sideways reflectionsis a book written by the Slovenian intellectual and cultural criticSlavoj Žižekthat addresses the role of violence within modern society, approaching it in terms ofObjectiveandSubjectiveviolence.
He analyses the violence in all forms. He made a difference between "Objective" and "Subjective" violence. Objective violence is that which is directly and evident, the wars, the repression, etc. And in the other hand, the subjective violence is the violence ejerced by capitalism, which is much more brutal, because it is social, it is present since we born and until we die. One type of violence is easily detected (objective) and the other it is not, that's why the subjective violence is much more powerful, brutal and effective.


Title: Sustainable UN Peacekeeping Offensive Operations: UXOs, ERW and IEDs | Small Wars Journal
Sustainable UN Peacekeeping Offensive Operations: UXOs, ERW and IEDs
Antonio Garcia
This essay explores the themes of United Nations (UN) peacekeeping offensive operations and Unexploded Ordinance (UXOs), Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). As the character of conflict changes, there is an increased international focus on IEDs. The traditional threat of ERW has been further complicated by the preponderance of IEDs in war-affected countries. The UN is thus adapting its conventional approach in dealing with mines and UXOs to the complexities of asymmetric warfare where IEDs have increasingly become the weapon of choice for non-state actors. Earlier this year, United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) celebrated its 20thyear anniversary as the lead UN agency addressing the scourge of mines, and UXOs.  The Security Council and UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has also taken novel approaches in combating spoilers with the deployment of the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) as the first strategically mandated offensive peacekeeping force. This essay discusses the interrelation between UN peacekeeping offensive action and the creation of UXOs and its potential effect on local populations and existing humanitarian crises and adds tactical and strategic analysis.
The evolution of modern United Nations (UN) peacekeeping has resulted in a variety of complex operational situations with differing intensities of conflict. The use of force or the threat thereof to counter rebel groups and spoilers remains a fundamental part of peacekeeping, peace enforcement and prevention. The UN has adapted to changes in the operational environment with a number of innovations of which the deployment of the first offensively mandated force, the FIB, indicated a firm strategic resolve from the Security Council. The robust stance of the UN peacekeeping missions in Mali and the Central African Republic are also indicative of such approaches as well as the support role, which the UN has taken in the African Union mission in Somalia. This piece links the effect of tactical offensive operations to the further creation of ERW which may increasingly contribute to humanitarian crises.
The use of force is not new to peacekeeping, especially not in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where heavy tactical action was seen during the Congo Crisis in the 1960s as well as during the mid-2000s in Ituri and in and around Sake inter alia. The FIB’s tactical victory over the M23 was another notch on the belt for the militarists in the UN however the attempt at offensive action did not translate into any effective operation against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). Furthermore, the ineffective Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) of the M23 and FDLR failed to capitalize on the gains made and may have second and third knock-on effects, the extent of which remains to be seen.
The FIB operations made use of attack helicopters and ground forces, which in combination used artillery, rockets, mortars, grenades and small arms amongst other weaponry to attack and neutralize the M23. The ERW and UXOs, which resulted from the various operations, were never effectively cleared. Reports from FIB Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) operators indicate that some attempt was made at clearing UXOs. However the complete clearance of the battlefields/areas of combat remains in question. As a result, in subsequent years, munitions from the previous combat were still found in and around Munigi, Kubati hills and Rutshuru. Reports from non-FIB EOD teams which deployed with UNMAS in 2015 indicated a considerable number of UXOs which were unmarked in the general area. Such ERW were brought to the attention of UNMAS through the local population and were addressed on a case by case basis.
The question is thus posed, when a UN offensive force is deployed in battle, what are the UN’s responsibilities in terms of the post-combat clearance of UXOs?  Should a combined UN force and UNMAS EOD team declare a given battlefield free from explosives following such combat? This is perhaps something that the UN DPKO and Department of Field Support (DFS) in combination with UNMAS should consider. UNMAS provides humanitarian and peacekeeping support to the UN as required. The onus remains with the Force and the UN operational and strategic headquarters to incorporate UNMAS in the battle plan and Concept of Operations. The question of whether there is comprehensive doctrinal guidance for UXO clearance post-offensive operations remains unclear.
There is a need for post combat doctrinal guidance, which should indicate the extent of the area to be cleared and declared free from ammunition and explosives as well as the timeframe for such clearance and the relevant monitoring and reporting channels, following a battle or skirmish.  In order to ensure proper checks and balances the question is posed as to whether UNMAS officers should declare battlefields/areas where skirmishes have occurred free of munitions after the engagement when the tactical situation allows (and map them)? This is an important consideration, especially with the advent of UN peacekeeping offensive operations and continued robust peacekeeping.
There appears to be a disconnect in understanding between UN military advisors and UNMAS staff in regards to what is happening in the field versus doctrinal and mandated requirements. Where the military advisors generally advocate for a more aggressive approach to operations and combatting IEDs, UNMAS tend to work within the scope indicated in the respective mandates and has a primary humanitarian focus. The military tends to view IEDs pragmatically, with a need for a comprehensive strategy and suitable Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), where UNMAS who are also fully operational at the sharp end, has to consider the broader policy issues, standards and guidelines. In this regard a technical manual is in production and will be published later this year. While the operational situation is becoming more dangerous and complex it is worrying to think that the strategic level is under what appears to be a self imposed fog of war, which in all likelihood will take some time to lift.
While considering the role of the armed groups (and opponents of UN peacekeepers), which directly contribute to the creation of an unsafe environment, we should also consider how the UN indirectly adds to such issues. Various armed groups and non-state actors are increasingly using non-conventional tactics and terrorist methods in the execution of operations. The threat of such actors directly destabilizes the security of missions. IED attacks are increasingly being applied in peacekeeping operations, posing a considerable threat to the local population and UN peacekeepers.
There is perhaps nothing which strikes more fear into the hearts of TCCs than the threat of IEDs. For a nation at war, the threat of IEDs are a regular occurrence and the death and injury caused by such weapons are part of the damage associated with the ultimate sacrifice of war.  Peacekeeping in its many forms, is different to war fighting, and there is a much lower national will and appetite for losses in peace operations. While IEDs are used as a means to achieve military and other ends there are also more neutral explosive threats in mission areas. ERW, mines and UXOs which often exist as the legacy of high-intensity operations, still pose the greatest non-prejudiced threat to local populations. In this regard, UXOs pose a particular risk to children who often come into contact with them, do not understand their danger, and play with them mistaking them for toys.
With the evolution of peace missions UN forces have come into contact with more sophisticated armed actors and we have seen the manipulation of UXOs which are subsequently developed into IEDs. The DRC has had an increase in IED attacks over the last few years and one such device was detonated in Goma in 2016; there has been a considerable number of IED attacks in Mali and Somalia to only mention a few missions. This is a clear indication of the growing threat of such devices to peacekeeping operations. This threat is magnified by the availability of UXOs which can be modified into IEDs and should be seen as a growing potential security challenge.  In this regard the UN is obligated to ensure that following conventional operations, all battlefields are cleared of munitions. This will prevent the knock on effect of ERW modification into IEDs.  In the grand scheme this can be regarded as a minor point however it is important in creating a culture of sustainable peacekeeping operations.
One final point to be considered is the way in which the UN selects its Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs), especially those who should form part of its peacekeeping offensive force. A key requirement should be the consideration of whether a given country is signatory to the various international laws and conventions on weapons and munitions. In this regard, the UN should have certain standards for example, state X should be signatory to the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW); Convention on the Prohibition of Land-Mines etc. The FIB comprises Malawi, Tanzania and South Africa as TCCs. Where South Africa is party to the CCW, Malawi and Tanzania are not. CCW Protocol V specifically addresses the scourge of ERW and the humanitarian problems, which it causes and exacerbates. In this regard, some serious legal questions could be posed as to the requirements or specification of the UN when selecting TCCs, especially in an offensive role. The norms of a state dictates its organizational and doctrinal tendencies, and if a TCC does not consider that being part to the CCW is important how does that influence its approach to offensive peace operations? With regards to Protocol V, are ERW just left behind? Is it solely the responsibility of UNMAS to deal with the threat of UXOs?
The strategic issue of signing international conventions may be outside the direct control of the UN, however the mission has leverage over the FIB and other robustly applied forces, in terms of their application. The South African, Tanzanian and Malawian battalions which comprise the FIB are all deployed with a combat engineer platoon each with limited EOD capabilities. These engineers can be used in conjunction with UNMAS to clear previous battlefields and areas where munitions were discharged. By doing this they will ensure that the FIB does not worsen an already appalling humanitarian situation. Furthermore, the FIB combat engineers could become a force multiplier to UNMAS. In considering such an option it would be similar to the use of military construction engineers, which fulfill a development role, in the building of infrastructure and a tactical role in the provision of force mobility. A similar function could be undertaken by the FIB EOD teams where they could assist UNMAS in the clearance of UXOs. This would need to be mandated and the correct organizational infrastructure, documentation and postings would need to be in place (Status of Force Agreements, Concept of Operations, Mission Strategy, FIB Military Engineer Staff Officer, liaison with UNMAS amongst other factors).
The essay discussed tactical as well as strategic elements in terms of offensive operations and UXOs. The international legal standards must provide the necessary guidance where field operations deal with the practical implications of IEDs. When viewing conflict through the lens of IEDs, the normative framework includes international conventions, policies, mandates and TTPs. On a practical level, without sufficient decontamination of battlefields through UNMAS, contractors or military engineers – the battle may achieve tactical aims but also creates a humanitarian hazard to the local population. In conclusion, the ultimate aim of the UN peacekeeping offensive action should be to promote security, safety and trust and thus the clearing of self-created UXOs should be compulsory. Furthermore, the clearing of UXOs will help win the hearts and minds of the local population. In relation to mine action and IEDs, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that a peace without mine action was an incomplete peace and people should not have to live in fear of dying after the of conflict (https://theowp.org/un-secretary-general-peace-without-mine-action-is-incomplete-peace/).

In the book "Doorway to Hell" the authors reveal that the US tax payer paid 1 Billion dollars for an isolated almost xenophobic compound in Somalia that provided swimming pools and AC for UN employees.  The cost of UN peace keepers, blue helmets,  who were totally ineffective, cost the US tax payer as much as a boot on the ground.  These facts were never released to the US public by President Clinton's administration.I just  got off the article that attacks the Trump administration for even knowing Prince and questioning the cost of hiring "mercenaries".  At a time the DOD is debating the cost of funding our own soldiers and trending towards a draft. The intent from the left being to stymie any military deployment by creating large numbers of draft resisters. A fact most DOD reports do not even debate.So the US soldier is too expensive, the Contractors "mercenaries" are too expensive, how much does a blue helmet cost based on President Clinton's spending model  in Somalia?Why  should we the people fund at the same exorbitant rate UN blue helmets, who have no track record and half the salary of the UN troops is gleaned from them by their governments that deploy them like mercenaries?For globalist ambitions?
