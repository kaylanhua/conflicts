UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
The M23 movement, also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, has been fighting the Congolese government since April last year following a mutiny.
“UN is deeply concerned about reports of alleged mistreatment of M23 detainees and desecration of corpses of M23 combatants by the Congolese armed forces,” reads part of the statement released yesterday by Ki-moon’s office.
The statement further adds, the United Nations Organization Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Monusco) has ‘raised the matter at the highest level with the FARDC’ and welcomes steps by the Congolese army to investigate the claims and to hold the perpetrators accountable.
Images of DRC soldiers prodding the body of an M23 rebel fighter have been shown on the internet and the desecration of bodies is the latest scandal to hit FARDC.
The UN’s condemnation to Congolese army comes barely days after the government of Rwanda accused FARDC of deliberately shelling Rwanda’s western district of Rubavu.
The government described the attack as a provocative and deliberate act by FARDC and Monusco since there was no fighting in the area where the bombs were fired from.

Title: Africa keen to provide homegrown solutions to her challenges - 24Tanzania.com
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Great Lakes regional leaders were in Pretoria, South Africa for two major summits on Monday and Tuesday last week.Tanzanian forces of the UN Intervention Brigade attend a training session outside Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.The first one held on Monday was a joint SADC – International Conference for Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) Heads of State summit on peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).The second summit was about establishment of a mechanism for a swift and immediate response to crises. South African President, Jacob Zuma chaired the two summits.The summit on Congo was held on the backdrop of a dramatic turnaround of events where the M23 rebels that had taken over Goma, the regional capital of North Kivu about a year ago, were routed by the Congolese army until they surrendered, laid down arms and declared to end their 20-month insurgency in the mineral rich but impoverished eastern region of DRC.The DRC government was expected to sign a peace deal with the M23 rebel group in Kampala, Uganda yesterday in what analysts have described as an important milestone in the efforts to restore peace and stability in the central African country. The other summit held the following day was about the formation of a rapid-deployment emergency force to swiftly intervene in crises on the continent.This is a temporary arrangement pending the coming into operation of the long planned fullyfledged peacekeeping African Union’s African Standby Force. One important signal from the two summits is that Africa is becoming more responsible for its problems.The leaders in Africa are becoming more proactive in dealing with challenges affecting their countries. It is about homegrown solutions to problems in Africa (and not exactly African solutions to African problems as there is nothing purely African to wars, famine, corruption, etc).It is a deviation from the experience of the past where Africa sat hapless waiting for a rescue from Europe or America whenever it encountered a crisis. The Mali experience was a painful lesson to Africa. France led a military campaign in January to clear Islamist militants from the north of the country after they threatened to invade the capital Bamako.In an op-ed to the New York Times, Sammy Kum Buo, a Cameroon national, who was director for West, Central and North Africa in the U.N. Department of Political Affairs in New York from 2007 to 2012 said the Mali experience was a lesson on how risky it can be for Africa to wait for an assistance from outside the continent in times of crises.“The French military intervention in Mali, this year had not only saved the defenceless West African nation from almost certain complete occupation by marauding rebel forces, it had also rekindled a debate on the risks and costs of Africa’s dependence on international charity for survival.”The South African leader clearly shared the concerns. In his opening remarks of the Tuesday summit, he said Africa needed to build own capability that would obviate the need to call for assistance from foreign countries. He cited the example of the crisis in Mali where Africa was hapless and had to seek assistance from France.“The case of Mali is still fresh in our minds. We need to ensure that we are not helpless or slow to respond without the help of external partners,” he said. Africa becoming more responsible and proactive in dealing with her own challenges could also be testified with the military victory of Congolese army over the M23 rebel group leading to a renewed hope for peace and stability in the eastern Congo.About a year ago, the M23 rebels took over the provisional capital of Goma with civilians and aid workers fleeing.

Title: SANDF troops begin DRC rotation - defenceWeb
More than 800 soldiers from the South African National Defence Force are heading off to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as part of South Africa’s annual troop rotation.
The first batch of troops from 5 South African Infantry (SAI) Battalion was due to depart for the DRC on 30 May. An advance party of 50 personnel managing the handover left South Africa on Thursday last week.5 SAI is replacing 4 SAI for the year-long deployment. The main element of the rotation will take just over a week, using chartered aircraft, with the final flight leaving on 8 June. The first batch comprises 213 soldiers, with other flights leaving on 1, 6 and 8 June.
The first 188 soldiers from 4 SAI were due to arrive in the evening of 29 May, with the second batch due on 31 May and the remainder on 5 and 7 June.
The current troop rotation is for the United Nations’ Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) – the SANDF has other personnel with the UN in the DRC, such as an Air Force contingent, but they are rotated on a different schedule.
South African soldiers will be deployed in the Eastern DRC, close to the Rwandan border, where they are expected to mainly face Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.
Defence and Military Veterans minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula addressed the more than 800 soldiers at the mobilisation centre outside Bloemfontein on 29 May. She urged them to obey the rules and make South Africa proud.
She said South Africa’s involvement in peacekeeping has made the country among the world’s top five troop contributing countries, having taken part in UN, African Union and SADC operations in many different countries, from Lesotho to Sudan. “We’ve learnt a lot of lessons,” the minister said, “but we’re still learning and refining our skills.”
In addressing the soldiers about to be deployed, she said that in spite of the successes recognised in neutralising M23 rebels and other forces, she was concerned about the sexual exploitation and abuse of women by peacekeepers and urged the soldiers not to touch civilians. She said abuse is not just about rape but also taking advantage of women or forming relationships, as this is abuse of power.
There were seven cases of sexual exploitation and abuse registered in 2015, five in 2016, and three in the first three months of 2017.
The minister said she didn’t want any cases of abuse as this is embarrassing to the country and the SANDF. She also urged the soldiers to maintain discipline and strive to deserve the trust placed in them.
Through work, discipline and achievement the minister urged soldiers to rise to the occasion and make Africa a better place. “You have very big shoes to fill,” she said, as South African soldiers are known as “fearless” fighters. Along with troops from Tanzania and Malawi, South African forces played a vital role in defeating M23 rebels in the DRC in 2013.
Her visit on Monday coincided with the UN’s international peacekeepers’ commemoration day. Mapisa-Nqakula and senior SANDF leaders laid wreaths at the Tempe military base in honour of the 40 South African service members who have perished during UN operations over the last 15 years. They died in Burundi, the DRC and Sudan.
During her address to the 5 SAI, the minister also paid tribute to members who lost their lives overseas and in South Africa, including the 13 female soldiers who perished in a vehicle accident in 2016.

Title: FDLR will be disarmed, says UN Security Council - 24Tanzania.com
Monusco, The United Nations peacekeeping force in the neighbouring DRC, is committed to disarming the militia blamed for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, a top US diplomat at the United Nations has sad.President Paul Kagame poses for a group photo with Amb. Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN (front, left), Amb. Agshin Mehdiyev, the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN (front, right) and other visiting members of the United Nations Security Council after the meeting yesterday. The New Times/ Village Urugwiro.Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN, said Monusco leaders had assured a visiting delegation of United Nations Security Council that the force, shored up by a newly deployed battalion with a more robust mandate, would fight the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militants.“They made it clear they have every intention to deal with the FDLR in support of the forces from the DRC,” Power told reporters in Kigali after the Security Council delegation held talks with President Paul Kagame at Village Urugwiro.Power, who alongside the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN, Agshin Mehdiyev, are leading the delegation on a regional tour of four countries, said the FDLR had “wreaked terrible havoc on civilians in eastern Congo”, pointing out that “some of them people who are part of the FDLR are people who are responsible for one of the worst crimes of the last century here in Rwanda.”More than a million Rwandans were butchered during the 100 days of the Genocide that only ended when the forces loyal to the now ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) took Kigali, prompting the genocide machinery to flee into the Congo, practically taking with them hundreds of thousands of civilians.Voluntary returnAlmost all the civilians and thousands of militants have since voluntarily returned home, but extremists have set up bases in the Congo where they have reportedly benefited from Kinshasa over the years.Amb. Power said the FDLR and other armed groups in eastern DRC need to be eliminated to allow the people in the Great Lakes region a chance to rebuild their lives toward a bright future.FDLR overall commander Sylvester Mudacumura is among the top FDLR leaders who were slapped with travel and financial bans, and both the group’s president Ignace Murawanashyaka and vice president Straton Musoni are on trial in Stuttgart, Germany, in connection with the genocidal militia’s activities.“I think we have verbal commitments that you need, you’ve the international community strongly behind the Addis Ababa and Kampala frameworks, which is a very good beginning,” said the former journalist.She was referring to the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Congo and the region signed by 11 regional states in Ethiopia in February, 2013, and the ongoing peace talks between the Congolese government and the M23 rebels in Uganda.But she warned, “We have seen this movie before, there have been other hopeful times and what will determine whether or not this period is different is whether this time, in fact, the armed groups are demobilised.”Amb. Mehdiyev of Azerbaijan, which holds the rotating chair of the Security Council for the month of October, said their mission was not undertaken to point fingers at anyone, but rather to support the ongoing efforts to return peace to the troubled region.Speaking earlier, yesterday, during the diplomats’ visit to the Rwanda Demobilisation and Rehabilitation Centre in Mutobo, Musanze District, where they heard testimonies from ex-combatants, Amb. Power commended Rwanda’s efforts to reintegrate former FDLR militants, whom she said looked relieved that they were finally home because they had been held captive by the group’s leaders.The delegation also visited the Kigali Genocide memorial where Power nearly broke down in tears after touring the site and paid a glowing tribute to the people of Rwanda for “opening up” to the rest of the world despite the tragedy the befell them nearly 20 years ago.“It is almost 20 years after the Genocide and the power of not only what happened here in 1994, but the strength of the Rwandan people as they seek to move forward is immensely moving to me and to my colleagues,” she said.“Of course we all know what the United Nations failed to do back in 1994 for the Rwandan people, but the international community is determined to stand with the Rwandan people, in the same way that our guides today have, they were themselves 13 year-old boys at the time of the Genocide…. and they tell their stories so that diplomats like me, journalists, citizens, churchgoers, everyone in the world can know what happened here so that it never happens again in Rwanda and it never happens anywhere else in the World,” she added.The top American UN diplomat added, “And so we just want to express our thanks to the people of Rwanda for opening their hearts, sharing their photos, their stories of their family members.Remains of about 250,000 victims of the Genocide are buried at the memorial.Issue of child soldiersMeanwhile, speaking to journalists at Village Urugwiro following the visiting Security Council members’ with the President, Foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo reiterated that Kigali was not in any way involved with use of child soldiers in armed conflicts anywhere.“Rwanda is not a country that just appeared yesterday, it’s a country that has a track record and our track record in terms of military is very clear; that’s that Rwanda does not tolerate children being in any way near armed groups,” she said. We have done a lot in this country to stay away from this kind of practice” she said.Last Friday, the US government announced it had suspended military aid to Rwanda, along four other countries around the world, over Kigali’s alleged support of the M23 rebels, who are accused of recruiting children in their ranks.But Mushikiwabo said had this allegation been “properly investigated”, it would not have been difficult to find out that “it’s not in Rwanda’s practices to keep children near weapons”. “The issue of child soldiers and so forth is a consequence of the existence of these (armed) groups….and I believe that once these armed groups are no more, there will no longer be the issue of child soldiers.”The M23 rebellion broke out in April last year after officers linked to an earlier rebellion mutinied accusing Kinshasa of breaking the deal under which they had been integrated into the national army.Members of the UN Security Council arrived in Rwanda from Kinshasa and Goma – the capital of the troubled North Kivu province which is home to a myriad of militia groups, including the FDLR – where they met with senior government officials and visited Internally Displaced Persons.From Kigali, the delegation headed to Entebbe, Uganda before concluding the regional tour with a trip to Addis Ababa.Before arriving in the region over the weekend, the UN diplomats had a stop in Brussels in Belgium where they met with members the Political and Security Committee of the European Union over the Congo crisis.Rwanda is serving its first year on the Security Council and the country’s permanent representative to the UN, Amb.

President Paul Kagame poses for a group photo with Amb. Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN (front, left), Amb. Agshin Mehdiyev, the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN (front, right) and other visiting members of the United Nations Security Council after the meeting yesterday. The New Times/ Village Urugwiro.
Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN, said Monusco leaders had assured a visiting delegation of United Nations Security Council that the force, shored up by a newly deployed battalion with a more robust mandate, would fight the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militants.
“They made it clear they have every intention to deal with the FDLR in support of the forces from the DRC,” Power told reporters in Kigali after the Security Council delegation held talks with President Paul Kagame at Village Urugwiro.
Power, who alongside the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN, Agshin Mehdiyev, are leading the delegation on a regional tour of four countries, said the FDLR had “wreaked terrible havoc on civilians in eastern Congo”, pointing out that “some of them people who are part of the FDLR are people who are responsible for one of the worst crimes of the last century here in Rwanda.”
More than a million Rwandans were butchered during the 100 days of the Genocide that only ended when the forces loyal to the now ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) took Kigali, prompting the genocide machinery to flee into the Congo, practically taking with them hundreds of thousands of civilians.
Voluntary return
Almost all the civilians and thousands of militants have since voluntarily returned home, but extremists have set up bases in the Congo where they have reportedly benefited from Kinshasa over the years.
Amb. Power said the FDLR and other armed groups in eastern DRC need to be eliminated to allow the people in the Great Lakes region a chance to rebuild their lives toward a bright future.
FDLR overall commander Sylvester Mudacumura is among the top FDLR leaders who were slapped with travel and financial bans, and both the group’s president Ignace Murawanashyaka and vice president Straton Musoni are on trial in Stuttgart, Germany, in connection with the genocidal militia’s activities.
“I think we have verbal commitments that you need, you’ve the international community strongly behind the Addis Ababa and Kampala frameworks, which is a very good beginning,” said the former journalist.
She was referring to the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Congo and the region signed by 11 regional states in Ethiopia in February, 2013, and the ongoing peace talks between the Congolese government and the M23 rebels in Uganda.
But she warned, “We have seen this movie before, there have been other hopeful times and what will determine whether or not this period is different is whether this time, in fact, the armed groups are demobilised.”
Amb. Mehdiyev of Azerbaijan, which holds the rotating chair of the Security Council for the month of October, said their mission was not undertaken to point fingers at anyone, but rather to support the ongoing efforts to return peace to the troubled region.
Speaking earlier, yesterday, during the diplomats’ visit to the Rwanda Demobilisation and Rehabilitation Centre in Mutobo, Musanze District, where they heard testimonies from ex-combatants, Amb. Power commended Rwanda’s efforts to reintegrate former FDLR militants, whom she said looked relieved that they were finally home because they had been held captive by the group’s leaders.
The delegation also visited the Kigali Genocide memorial where Power nearly broke down in tears after touring the site and paid a glowing tribute to the people of Rwanda for “opening up” to the rest of the world despite the tragedy the befell them nearly 20 years ago.
“It is almost 20 years after the Genocide and the power of not only what happened here in 1994, but the strength of the Rwandan people as they seek to move forward is immensely moving to me and to my colleagues,” she said.
“Of course we all know what the United Nations failed to do back in 1994 for the Rwandan people, but the international community is determined to stand with the Rwandan people, in the same way that our guides today have, they were themselves 13 year-old boys at the time of the Genocide…. and they tell their stories so that diplomats like me, journalists, citizens, churchgoers, everyone in the world can know what happened here so that it never happens again in Rwanda and it never happens anywhere else in the World,” she added.
The top American UN diplomat added, “And so we just want to express our thanks to the people of Rwanda for opening their hearts, sharing their photos, their stories of their family members.
Remains of about 250,000 victims of the Genocide are buried at the memorial.Issue of child soldiers
Meanwhile, speaking to journalists at Village Urugwiro following the visiting Security Council members’ with the President, Foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo reiterated that Kigali was not in any way involved with use of child soldiers in armed conflicts anywhere.
“Rwanda is not a country that just appeared yesterday, it’s a country that has a track record and our track record in terms of military is very clear; that’s that Rwanda does not tolerate children being in any way near armed groups,” she said. We have done a lot in this country to stay away from this kind of practice” she said.
Last Friday, the US government announced it had suspended military aid to Rwanda, along four other countries around the world, over Kigali’s alleged support of the M23 rebels, who are accused of recruiting children in their ranks.
But Mushikiwabo said had this allegation been “properly investigated”, it would not have been difficult to find out that “it’s not in Rwanda’s practices to keep children near weapons”. “The issue of child soldiers and so forth is a consequence of the existence of these (armed) groups….and I believe that once these armed groups are no more, there will no longer be the issue of child soldiers.”
The M23 rebellion broke out in April last year after officers linked to an earlier rebellion mutinied accusing Kinshasa of breaking the deal under which they had been integrated into the national army.
Members of the UN Security Council arrived in Rwanda from Kinshasa and Goma – the capital of the troubled North Kivu province which is home to a myriad of militia groups, including the FDLR – where they met with senior government officials and visited Internally Displaced Persons.
From Kigali, the delegation headed to Entebbe, Uganda before concluding the regional tour with a trip to Addis Ababa.
Before arriving in the region over the weekend, the UN diplomats had a stop in Brussels in Belgium where they met with members the Political and Security Committee of the European Union over the Congo crisis.
Rwanda is serving its first year on the Security Council and the country’s permanent representative to the UN, Amb. Eugène-Richard Gasana, was among the visiting diplomats.

Title: The Best Defense Is No Offense: Why Cuts to UN Troops in Congo Could Be a Good Thing - Our World
Following strongpressurefrom the Trump administration to downsize peacekeeping across the board, the United Nations Security Councilcutby 3,600 the authorised troop levels for the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). This decision came only days after 40 Congolese police werebeheadedand two UN-contracted experts and their interpreter werekilledby militia members, and amidstwarningsby many Western countries that now is a bad time to draw down the UN in the country.
Earlier in March, UN Secretary-General António Guterres had in factrequestedadditional police units for MONUSCO to address the growing risks of violence (this was rejected by the Security Council). But there is a way to meet both the US demands for cuts and the UN’s call for better resources to protect people under threat: MONUSCO should remove the troops it uses for offensive combat operations and instead beef up its ability to move forces quickly around the country to protect civilians.
MONUSCO’s “Force Intervention Brigade” (FIB) has been called the “first ever offensive combat force” in UN peacekeeping. With 3,000 troops, air reconnaissance, surveillance drones, attack helicopters and the most robust mandate in UN history, the FIB should have been an exciting new chapter for peacekeeping. But after four years on the ground, it has become clear that offensive combat operations are a poor use of UN resources for three reasons: (1) they don’t really work; (2) they could well be harming civilians; and (3) they divert focus and resources away from more serious threats facing the Congolese people. Eliminating the very expensive FIB and using the savings to increase the UN’s ability to respond quickly and effectively to protect civilians would put resources where they are most needed, a good deal for Guterres and for Trump.
Establishedin the wake of the rebel group M23’s takeover of Goma in 2012, the FIB was initially successful in helping to defeat M23. But this victory was as muchthe result of concerted international pressure on Rwandato stop supporting the group and a sincere desire by Kinshasa to push the M23 out of the country. Since 2013, the FIB has had a dismal track record. It has failed to neutralise any of the otherfour armed groupsit was tasked to fight: the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the Front for the Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FRPI) and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).
According to the UN, these militias still retain the capacity to destabilise much of eastern DRC and continue to perpetrate attacks on local communities. In fact, the ADF carried out itsmost serious attacksin 2016 right under the nose of the FIB, during a period of sustained offensive operations against the ADF by MONUSCO and the Congolese army. In many areas, the local populationdeeply resentsMONUSCO for raising expectations without delivering.
MONUSCO and the Security Council have the wrong strategy, built on the misconception that there is a military solution for the militias of eastern Congo.
Why does the FIB fail to deliver? One reason is that MONUSCO and the Security Council have the wrong strategy, built on the misconception that there is a military solution for the militias of eastern Congo. For example, the FIB carries out aerial bombardment and delivers support to Congolese army ground maneuvers against the ADF, an attempt to degrade the ADF’s capabilities and to drive a wedge between the group and its supposed support base in western Uganda. But, after more than 20 years of living in eastern DRC, the ADF isnot a foreign Islamist group, it is part of the Congolese social fabric, an active participant in the illicit networks plundering the timber and mineral resources, andclosely linkedwith parts of the Congolese military and political establishment.
It can’t be separated from a base in Uganda because it has ample reservoirs of support within Congo, though characterising it as foreign and Islamic has adistinct utilityfor President Kabila and his allies. The same is true of the FDLR and FRPI groups: both are deeply embedded in Congolese society, able to draw from local populations for support and recruitment, fueled by natural resources within the country, and very unlikely to be seriously pressured by the FIB’s military campaign. The LRA, capable of slipping in and out of Congo’s highly porous borders with South Sudan, Uganda and Central African Republic, has proven equally elusive to military pressure.
Secondly, the FIB targets only four of themore than 70armed groups operating in DRC. For example, the recentspate of killingsin the Kasai region led to at least 400 deaths in the past eight months. However, because the group responsible for the killings is not on the FIB’s “hit list,” the FIB has no mandate to engage. Similarly, fighting in Tanganyika province in February this year led tomore than 150 deaths and the displacement of 430,000 people— again, not involving groups targeted by the FIB. This limitation means the FIB has essentially no role to play in combating some of the most serious atrocities in DRC, fromattackson vulnerable displaced populations,sexual violence and widespread human rights violationsagainst local communities, or even thekilling of UN peacekeepers. This is not to argue that the FIB should be expanded — in fact, the FIB would be a terrible choice to deal with most of these conflicts, which require politically-driven engagement and a protection-oriented force — but to point to the need for better use of resources.
What happens when the FIB sends in its attack helicopters to strike an ADF stronghold? To be honest, no one knows. MONUSCO rarely carries outbattle damage assessmentsfollowing a bombing raid, because the jungle canopy is too dense, and the FIB is not trained to conduct ground assessments in the jungle.  As one MONUSCO officialstated, “We are bombarding without eyes on the ground.” In fact, the UN has to take the government’s word that it’s even targeting the right spot in the jungle: MONUSCO generally gets its targets from the Congolese army.
What we do know is that following a MONUSCO offensive there tend to bereprisal attackson nearby villages and an increase inkidnappings, likely in an effort to refill the militia’s ranks after taking losses. Similarly, there arecredible reportsthat MONUSCO-supported offensives against the FDLR have triggered further displacements of the Hutu population, putting more people at risk. While these are not necessarily a direct result of the FIB’s activities, they point to the possibility that the FIB is doing more harm than good.
Well under half of those living in eastern DRC believe MONUSCO protects civilians at all, and nearly half of the eastern population thinks MONUSCO should leave altogether.
Furthermore, MONUSCO has historically insisted that the FIB conduct all its operations in support of the Congolese army, in part to avoid collateral damage on a terrain where the targets are difficult to determine. But by acting jointly with the Congolese army, even withmeasures to mitigate human rights violations, the UN appears complicit in some highly dubious activities in eastern DRC. According to the UN’sreporting, the Congolese state was responsible for roughly 65 percent of the human rights violations last year, and in many parts of the country, the army is seen by local communities as the most dangerous armed group. A well-respected organisation tracking this issue in the DRCcommentedthat joint operations with the Congolese army “at best forego opportunities for protecting civilians and, at worst, support FARDC operations that cause excessive civilian harm.” In an increasingly fractured country with pro- and anti-Kabila groups pitted viciously against each other — and withnearly 40 per centof the population of the view that MONUSCO is corrupt — the FIB’s close proximity to the Congolese army renders it too easily manipulated as a pawn in a political game being run from Kinshasa.

The FIB draws important attention and resources away from the core task of MONUSCO in eastern DRC: protecting civilians. One analystreferredto the FIB as “valium for MONUSCO”, allowing the other UN troops (the so-called “framework brigades”) to fall into apathy. By designating the FIB as the “robust” element of the mission, the other troops are implicitly let off the hook. This passivity has contributed torepeated failuresto protect civilians and an overall negative view of MONUSCO. Just ask the Congolese population: wellunder halfof those living in eastern DRC believe MONUSCO protects civilians at all, andnearly halfof the eastern population thinks MONUSCO should leave altogether.
The narrative that offensive operations will result in better protections for the people living in eastern DRC is highly questionable and quite possibly untrue (possibly a “fib”). Not only has it failed to degrade the militias it was tasked to fight, but the FIB has potentially increased risks to civilians and diverted resources away from activities that might well serve them better.
The Security Council’s decision to lower the troop ceiling by 3,600 troops is not necessarily as drastic as it sounds. MONUSCO regularly operates at well below its authorised troop levels anyway, due to the regular rotations of troops and a high vacancy rate, and there is a possibility that as few as500 troopswill actually be sent home. In a mission the size of MONUSCO, there are many ways to trim around the edges, such as drawing down troops in less conflict-affected areas (part of the mission’s exit strategy anyway). The question is whether the UN wants to continue with business as usual, tinkering with a mission that is expensive, unpopular, and showing extremely limited success in neutralising armed groups. Or, as some experts havesuggested, should the UN use the cuts to make more drastic changes to peacekeeping more broadly?
The crux of the question in Congo is whether the FIB is good value for money. The FIB represents a significant portion of MONUSCO’s US$1.2 billion budget. This money could be repurposed to deploy more mobile units capable of responding quickly wherever violence arises in Congo, and specifically tasked with defending Congolese under imminent risk. Unlike the FIB, these units would be equipped to quickly provide a protective presence in any areas where the risk to civilians was imminent, access hard to reach areas, and stay in place for several days without re-supply. This “rapidly deployable battalion” model hasalready been tried in MONUSCO, with some positive results, and could be replicated with the savings from the FIB. In fact, the Security Council has alreadyexpressed enthusiasmfor making MONUSCO “more active, more agile, more mobile.” Removing the FIB could also have the positive impact of energizing the other troops in the mission, who could no longer point to the FIB as the “robust part” of MONUSCO.
There are also cheaper options for beefing up MONUSCO’s response apart from troops. Some of the money saved by getting rid of the FIB could go into improving the ability of the UN to track and disrupt the criminal networks bleeding the country dry of natural resources and feeding militias in the east, or toimproving early warning networks. These could be established at a fraction of the cost of maintaining the FIB, and would likely have more impact.
The risks to civilians will almost certainly grow in the coming months as President Kabila looks for any reason to cling on to power beyond the end of the year. Bombing rebel positions in the jungle is the last thing MONUSCO needs to be doing with its limited resources. Instead, the UN should use the Security Council’s cuts to help it take a tough decision: end the experiment with offensive combat and focus on helping the Congolese weather the coming storm.

Title: SANDF troops begin DRC rotation - defenceWeb
More than 800 soldiers from the South African National Defence Force are heading off to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as part of South Africa’s annual troop rotation.
The first batch of troops from 5 South African Infantry (SAI) Battalion was due to depart for the DRC on 30 May. An advance party of 50 personnel managing the handover left South Africa on Thursday last week.5 SAI is replacing 4 SAI for the year-long deployment. The main element of the rotation will take just over a week, using chartered aircraft, with the final flight leaving on 8 June. The first batch comprises 213 soldiers, with other flights leaving on 1, 6 and 8 June.
The first 188 soldiers from 4 SAI were due to arrive in the evening of 29 May, with the second batch due on 31 May and the remainder on 5 and 7 June.
The current troop rotation is for the United Nations’ Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) – the SANDF has other personnel with the UN in the DRC, such as an Air Force contingent, but they are rotated on a different schedule.
South African soldiers will be deployed in the Eastern DRC, close to the Rwandan border, where they are expected to mainly face Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.
Defence and Military Veterans minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula addressed the more than 800 soldiers at the mobilisation centre outside Bloemfontein on 29 May. She urged them to obey the rules and make South Africa proud.
She said South Africa’s involvement in peacekeeping has made the country among the world’s top five troop contributing countries, having taken part in UN, African Union and SADC operations in many different countries, from Lesotho to Sudan. “We’ve learnt a lot of lessons,” the minister said, “but we’re still learning and refining our skills.”
In addressing the soldiers about to be deployed, she said that in spite of the successes recognised in neutralising M23 rebels and other forces, she was concerned about the sexual exploitation and abuse of women by peacekeepers and urged the soldiers not to touch civilians. She said abuse is not just about rape but also taking advantage of women or forming relationships, as this is abuse of power.
There were seven cases of sexual exploitation and abuse registered in 2015, five in 2016, and three in the first three months of 2017.
The minister said she didn’t want any cases of abuse as this is embarrassing to the country and the SANDF. She also urged the soldiers to maintain discipline and strive to deserve the trust placed in them.
Through work, discipline and achievement the minister urged soldiers to rise to the occasion and make Africa a better place. “You have very big shoes to fill,” she said, as South African soldiers are known as “fearless” fighters. Along with troops from Tanzania and Malawi, South African forces played a vital role in defeating M23 rebels in the DRC in 2013.
Her visit on Monday coincided with the UN’s international peacekeepers’ commemoration day. Mapisa-Nqakula and senior SANDF leaders laid wreaths at the Tempe military base in honour of the 40 South African service members who have perished during UN operations over the last 15 years. They died in Burundi, the DRC and Sudan.
During her address to the 5 SAI, the minister also paid tribute to members who lost their lives overseas and in South Africa, including the 13 female soldiers who perished in a vehicle accident in 2016.

Title: SA troops to be deployed to the DRC's triangle of death - Talk of the Town

“The enemy is everywhere. Do not think that just because you are simply outside your base they [the enemy] are not there.”
Mapisa-Nqakula — who was in Bloemfontein to commemorate the United Nations Peacekeepers Day — paid homage to the families of the 39 South African peacekeepers who have died while on UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions since 1999.
Addressing the 850 soldiers from 5 South African Infantry Battalion‚ who are to be deployed as part of the UN’s Force Intervention Brigade in the eastern DRC‚ Mapisa-Nqakula said she would not tolerate “nonsense” from the troops.
“You have names of your predecessors to live up to‚ many of who gave their lives in trying to bring peace and security to vulnerable people.
“I do not want to hear of you starting relationships with people in your deployment area because you will be in violation of these rules. These people are vulnerable and look up to you as their protectors.”
Mapisa-Nqakula’s warning follows a 2015 UN report which revealed that South African peacekeepers were amongst the worst when it came to sexual predators in UN peacekeeping missions.
She urged the troops to carry themselves with pride.
“There are command and control structures in place and these must be adhered to. I am talking to you as your minister and your mother. Don’t do things — like visit brothels or take drugs — that you wouldn’t do in front of me or your families.
“I am not going to tell you this again. You are in this deployment to show to the world that we can bring peace to Africa.
“If you come home in body bags let that be because you died fighting like a hero not because of some other nonsense.”
The area the troops are to be deployed to is occupied by the Islamic extremist group known as the ADF. The area and other areas the troops are to be stationed in‚ which include thick jungles near the Rwandan border‚ are also home to dozens of other militia affiliated to the Mai Mai and other rebel groups fighting for control of valuable mineral resources.

Title: FDLR coordinated July 26 grenade attack in Kigali – suspects - 24Tanzania.com
The DR Congo-based Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia is responsible for the fatal July 26 grenade attack in Kigali’s commercial hub of Nyabugogo, which killed three people, the prime suspects have said.Suspects Ntakirutimana alias Rafiki and Mugaboniki (R) speaking to journalists at the Kicukiro Police Station earlier today.

Title: FDLR will be disarmed, says UN Security Council - 24Tanzania.com
Monusco, The United Nations peacekeeping force in the neighbouring DRC, is committed to disarming the militia blamed for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, a top US diplomat at the United Nations has sad.President Paul Kagame poses for a group photo with Amb. Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN (front, left), Amb. Agshin Mehdiyev, the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN (front, right) and other visiting members of the United Nations Security Council after the meeting yesterday. The New Times/ Village Urugwiro.Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the UN, said Monusco leaders had assured a visiting delegation of United Nations Security Council that the force, shored up by a newly deployed battalion with a more robust mandate, would fight the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militants.“They made it clear they have every intention to deal with the FDLR in support of the forces from the DRC,” Power told reporters in Kigali after the Security Council delegation held talks with President Paul Kagame at Village Urugwiro.Power, who alongside the Azerbaijan envoy to the UN, Agshin Mehdiyev, are leading the delegation on a regional tour of four countries, said the FDLR had “wreaked terrible havoc on civilians in eastern Congo”, pointing out that “some of them people who are part of the FDLR are people who are responsible for one of the worst crimes of the last century here in Rwanda.”More than a million Rwandans were butchered during the 100 days of the Genocide that only ended when the forces loyal to the now ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) took Kigali, prompting the genocide machinery to flee into the Congo, practically taking with them hundreds of thousands of civilians.Voluntary returnAlmost all the civilians and thousands of militants have since voluntarily returned home, but extremists have set up bases in the Congo where they have reportedly benefited from Kinshasa over the years.Amb. Power said the FDLR and other armed groups in eastern DRC need to be eliminated to allow the people in the Great Lakes region a chance to rebuild their lives toward a bright future.FDLR overall commander Sylvester Mudacumura is among the top FDLR leaders who were slapped with travel and financial bans, and both the group’s president Ignace Murawanashyaka and vice president Straton Musoni are on trial in Stuttgart, Germany, in connection with the genocidal militia’s activities.“I think we have verbal commitments that you need, you’ve the international community strongly behind the Addis Ababa and Kampala frameworks, which is a very good beginning,” said the former journalist.She was referring to the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Congo and the region signed by 11 regional states in Ethiopia in February, 2013, and the ongoing peace talks between the Congolese government and the M23 rebels in Uganda.But she warned, “We have seen this movie before, there have been other hopeful times and what will determine whether or not this period is different is whether this time, in fact, the armed groups are demobilised.”Amb. Mehdiyev of Azerbaijan, which holds the rotating chair of the Security Council for the month of October, said their mission was not undertaken to point fingers at anyone, but rather to support the ongoing efforts to return peace to the troubled region.Speaking earlier, yesterday, during the diplomats’ visit to the Rwanda Demobilisation and Rehabilitation Centre in Mutobo, Musanze District, where they heard testimonies from ex-combatants, Amb. Power commended Rwanda’s efforts to reintegrate former FDLR militants, whom she said looked relieved that they were finally home because they had been held captive by the group’s leaders.The delegation also visited the Kigali Genocide memorial where Power nearly broke down in tears after touring the site and paid a glowing tribute to the people of Rwanda for “opening up” to the rest of the world despite the tragedy the befell them nearly 20 years ago.“It is almost 20 years after the Genocide and the power of not only what happened here in 1994, but the strength of the Rwandan people as they seek to move forward is immensely moving to me and to my colleagues,” she said.“Of course we all know what the United Nations failed to do back in 1994 for the Rwandan people, but the international community is determined to stand with the Rwandan people, in the same way that our guides today have, they were themselves 13 year-old boys at the time of the Genocide…. and they tell their stories so that diplomats like me, journalists, citizens, churchgoers, everyone in the world can know what happened here so that it never happens again in Rwanda and it never happens anywhere else in the World,” she added.The top American UN diplomat added, “And so we just want to express our thanks to the people of Rwanda for opening their hearts, sharing their photos, their stories of their family members.Remains of about 250,000 victims of the Genocide are buried at the memorial.Issue of child soldiersMeanwhile, speaking to journalists at Village Urugwiro following the visiting Security Council members’ with the President, Foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo reiterated that Kigali was not in any way involved with use of child soldiers in armed conflicts anywhere.“Rwanda is not a country that just appeared yesterday, it’s a country that has a track record and our track record in terms of military is very clear; that’s that Rwanda does not tolerate children being in any way near armed groups,” she said. We have done a lot in this country to stay away from this kind of practice” she said.Last Friday, the US government announced it had suspended military aid to Rwanda, along four other countries around the world, over Kigali’s alleged support of the M23 rebels, who are accused of recruiting children in their ranks.But Mushikiwabo said had this allegation been “properly investigated”, it would not have been difficult to find out that “it’s not in Rwanda’s practices to keep children near weapons”. “The issue of child soldiers and so forth is a consequence of the existence of these (armed) groups….and I believe that once these armed groups are no more, there will no longer be the issue of child soldiers.”The M23 rebellion broke out in April last year after officers linked to an earlier rebellion mutinied accusing Kinshasa of breaking the deal under which they had been integrated into the national army.Members of the UN Security Council arrived in Rwanda from Kinshasa and Goma – the capital of the troubled North Kivu province which is home to a myriad of militia groups, including the FDLR – where they met with senior government officials and visited Internally Displaced Persons.From Kigali, the delegation headed to Entebbe, Uganda before concluding the regional tour with a trip to Addis Ababa.Before arriving in the region over the weekend, the UN diplomats had a stop in Brussels in Belgium where they met with members the Political and Security Committee of the European Union over the Congo crisis.Rwanda is serving its first year on the Security Council and the country’s permanent representative to the UN, Amb.

More than a million Rwandans were butchered during the 100 days of the Genocide that only ended when the forces loyal to the now ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) took Kigali, prompting the genocide machinery to flee into the Congo, practically taking with them hundreds of thousands of civilians.
Voluntary return
Almost all the civilians and thousands of militants have since voluntarily returned home, but extremists have set up bases in the Congo where they have reportedly benefited from Kinshasa over the years.
Amb. Power said the FDLR and other armed groups in eastern DRC need to be eliminated to allow the people in the Great Lakes region a chance to rebuild their lives toward a bright future.
FDLR overall commander Sylvester Mudacumura is among the top FDLR leaders who were slapped with travel and financial bans, and both the group’s president Ignace Murawanashyaka and vice president Straton Musoni are on trial in Stuttgart, Germany, in connection with the genocidal militia’s activities.
“I think we have verbal commitments that you need, you’ve the international community strongly behind the Addis Ababa and Kampala frameworks, which is a very good beginning,” said the former journalist.
She was referring to the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Congo and the region signed by 11 regional states in Ethiopia in February, 2013, and the ongoing peace talks between the Congolese government and the M23 rebels in Uganda.
But she warned, “We have seen this movie before, there have been other hopeful times and what will determine whether or not this period is different is whether this time, in fact, the armed groups are demobilised.”
Amb. Mehdiyev of Azerbaijan, which holds the rotating chair of the Security Council for the month of October, said their mission was not undertaken to point fingers at anyone, but rather to support the ongoing efforts to return peace to the troubled region.
Speaking earlier, yesterday, during the diplomats’ visit to the Rwanda Demobilisation and Rehabilitation Centre in Mutobo, Musanze District, where they heard testimonies from ex-combatants, Amb. Power commended Rwanda’s efforts to reintegrate former FDLR militants, whom she said looked relieved that they were finally home because they had been held captive by the group’s leaders.
The delegation also visited the Kigali Genocide memorial where Power nearly broke down in tears after touring the site and paid a glowing tribute to the people of Rwanda for “opening up” to the rest of the world despite the tragedy the befell them nearly 20 years ago.
“It is almost 20 years after the Genocide and the power of not only what happened here in 1994, but the strength of the Rwandan people as they seek to move forward is immensely moving to me and to my colleagues,” she said.
“Of course we all know what the United Nations failed to do back in 1994 for the Rwandan people, but the international community is determined to stand with the Rwandan people, in the same way that our guides today have, they were themselves 13 year-old boys at the time of the Genocide…. and they tell their stories so that diplomats like me, journalists, citizens, churchgoers, everyone in the world can know what happened here so that it never happens again in Rwanda and it never happens anywhere else in the World,” she added.
The top American UN diplomat added, “And so we just want to express our thanks to the people of Rwanda for opening their hearts, sharing their photos, their stories of their family members.
Remains of about 250,000 victims of the Genocide are buried at the memorial.Issue of child soldiers
Meanwhile, speaking to journalists at Village Urugwiro following the visiting Security Council members’ with the President, Foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo reiterated that Kigali was not in any way involved with use of child soldiers in armed conflicts anywhere.
“Rwanda is not a country that just appeared yesterday, it’s a country that has a track record and our track record in terms of military is very clear; that’s that Rwanda does not tolerate children being in any way near armed groups,” she said. We have done a lot in this country to stay away from this kind of practice” she said.
Last Friday, the US government announced it had suspended military aid to Rwanda, along four other countries around the world, over Kigali’s alleged support of the M23 rebels, who are accused of recruiting children in their ranks.
But Mushikiwabo said had this allegation been “properly investigated”, it would not have been difficult to find out that “it’s not in Rwanda’s practices to keep children near weapons”. “The issue of child soldiers and so forth is a consequence of the existence of these (armed) groups….and I believe that once these armed groups are no more, there will no longer be the issue of child soldiers.”
The M23 rebellion broke out in April last year after officers linked to an earlier rebellion mutinied accusing Kinshasa of breaking the deal under which they had been integrated into the national army.
Members of the UN Security Council arrived in Rwanda from Kinshasa and Goma – the capital of the troubled North Kivu province which is home to a myriad of militia groups, including the FDLR – where they met with senior government officials and visited Internally Displaced Persons.
From Kigali, the delegation headed to Entebbe, Uganda before concluding the regional tour with a trip to Addis Ababa.
Before arriving in the region over the weekend, the UN diplomats had a stop in Brussels in Belgium where they met with members the Political and Security Committee of the European Union over the Congo crisis.
Rwanda is serving its first year on the Security Council and the country’s permanent representative to the UN, Amb. Eugène-Richard Gasana, was among the visiting diplomats.

Title: The Best Defense Is No Offense: Why Cuts to UN Troops in Congo Could Be a Good Thing - Our World
Following strongpressurefrom the Trump administration to downsize peacekeeping across the board, the United Nations Security Councilcutby 3,600 the authorised troop levels for the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). This decision came only days after 40 Congolese police werebeheadedand two UN-contracted experts and their interpreter werekilledby militia members, and amidstwarningsby many Western countries that now is a bad time to draw down the UN in the country.
Earlier in March, UN Secretary-General António Guterres had in factrequestedadditional police units for MONUSCO to address the growing risks of violence (this was rejected by the Security Council). But there is a way to meet both the US demands for cuts and the UN’s call for better resources to protect people under threat: MONUSCO should remove the troops it uses for offensive combat operations and instead beef up its ability to move forces quickly around the country to protect civilians.
MONUSCO’s “Force Intervention Brigade” (FIB) has been called the “first ever offensive combat force” in UN peacekeeping. With 3,000 troops, air reconnaissance, surveillance drones, attack helicopters and the most robust mandate in UN history, the FIB should have been an exciting new chapter for peacekeeping. But after four years on the ground, it has become clear that offensive combat operations are a poor use of UN resources for three reasons: (1) they don’t really work; (2) they could well be harming civilians; and (3) they divert focus and resources away from more serious threats facing the Congolese people. Eliminating the very expensive FIB and using the savings to increase the UN’s ability to respond quickly and effectively to protect civilians would put resources where they are most needed, a good deal for Guterres and for Trump.
Establishedin the wake of the rebel group M23’s takeover of Goma in 2012, the FIB was initially successful in helping to defeat M23. But this victory was as muchthe result of concerted international pressure on Rwandato stop supporting the group and a sincere desire by Kinshasa to push the M23 out of the country. Since 2013, the FIB has had a dismal track record. It has failed to neutralise any of the otherfour armed groupsit was tasked to fight: the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the Front for the Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FRPI) and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).
According to the UN, these militias still retain the capacity to destabilise much of eastern DRC and continue to perpetrate attacks on local communities. In fact, the ADF carried out itsmost serious attacksin 2016 right under the nose of the FIB, during a period of sustained offensive operations against the ADF by MONUSCO and the Congolese army. In many areas, the local populationdeeply resentsMONUSCO for raising expectations without delivering.
MONUSCO and the Security Council have the wrong strategy, built on the misconception that there is a military solution for the militias of eastern Congo.
Why does the FIB fail to deliver? One reason is that MONUSCO and the Security Council have the wrong strategy, built on the misconception that there is a military solution for the militias of eastern Congo. For example, the FIB carries out aerial bombardment and delivers support to Congolese army ground maneuvers against the ADF, an attempt to degrade the ADF’s capabilities and to drive a wedge between the group and its supposed support base in western Uganda. But, after more than 20 years of living in eastern DRC, the ADF isnot a foreign Islamist group, it is part of the Congolese social fabric, an active participant in the illicit networks plundering the timber and mineral resources, andclosely linkedwith parts of the Congolese military and political establishment.
It can’t be separated from a base in Uganda because it has ample reservoirs of support within Congo, though characterising it as foreign and Islamic has adistinct utilityfor President Kabila and his allies. The same is true of the FDLR and FRPI groups: both are deeply embedded in Congolese society, able to draw from local populations for support and recruitment, fueled by natural resources within the country, and very unlikely to be seriously pressured by the FIB’s military campaign. The LRA, capable of slipping in and out of Congo’s highly porous borders with South Sudan, Uganda and Central African Republic, has proven equally elusive to military pressure.
Secondly, the FIB targets only four of themore than 70armed groups operating in DRC. For example, the recentspate of killingsin the Kasai region led to at least 400 deaths in the past eight months. However, because the group responsible for the killings is not on the FIB’s “hit list,” the FIB has no mandate to engage. Similarly, fighting in Tanganyika province in February this year led tomore than 150 deaths and the displacement of 430,000 people— again, not involving groups targeted by the FIB. This limitation means the FIB has essentially no role to play in combating some of the most serious atrocities in DRC, fromattackson vulnerable displaced populations,sexual violence and widespread human rights violationsagainst local communities, or even thekilling of UN peacekeepers. This is not to argue that the FIB should be expanded — in fact, the FIB would be a terrible choice to deal with most of these conflicts, which require politically-driven engagement and a protection-oriented force — but to point to the need for better use of resources.
What happens when the FIB sends in its attack helicopters to strike an ADF stronghold? To be honest, no one knows. MONUSCO rarely carries outbattle damage assessmentsfollowing a bombing raid, because the jungle canopy is too dense, and the FIB is not trained to conduct ground assessments in the jungle.  As one MONUSCO officialstated, “We are bombarding without eyes on the ground.” In fact, the UN has to take the government’s word that it’s even targeting the right spot in the jungle: MONUSCO generally gets its targets from the Congolese army.
What we do know is that following a MONUSCO offensive there tend to bereprisal attackson nearby villages and an increase inkidnappings, likely in an effort to refill the militia’s ranks after taking losses. Similarly, there arecredible reportsthat MONUSCO-supported offensives against the FDLR have triggered further displacements of the Hutu population, putting more people at risk. While these are not necessarily a direct result of the FIB’s activities, they point to the possibility that the FIB is doing more harm than good.
Well under half of those living in eastern DRC believe MONUSCO protects civilians at all, and nearly half of the eastern population thinks MONUSCO should leave altogether.
Furthermore, MONUSCO has historically insisted that the FIB conduct all its operations in support of the Congolese army, in part to avoid collateral damage on a terrain where the targets are difficult to determine. But by acting jointly with the Congolese army, even withmeasures to mitigate human rights violations, the UN appears complicit in some highly dubious activities in eastern DRC. According to the UN’sreporting, the Congolese state was responsible for roughly 65 percent of the human rights violations last year, and in many parts of the country, the army is seen by local communities as the most dangerous armed group. A well-respected organisation tracking this issue in the DRCcommentedthat joint operations with the Congolese army “at best forego opportunities for protecting civilians and, at worst, support FARDC operations that cause excessive civilian harm.” In an increasingly fractured country with pro- and anti-Kabila groups pitted viciously against each other — and withnearly 40 per centof the population of the view that MONUSCO is corrupt — the FIB’s close proximity to the Congolese army renders it too easily manipulated as a pawn in a political game being run from Kinshasa.

The FIB draws important attention and resources away from the core task of MONUSCO in eastern DRC: protecting civilians. One analystreferredto the FIB as “valium for MONUSCO”, allowing the other UN troops (the so-called “framework brigades”) to fall into apathy. By designating the FIB as the “robust” element of the mission, the other troops are implicitly let off the hook. This passivity has contributed torepeated failuresto protect civilians and an overall negative view of MONUSCO. Just ask the Congolese population: wellunder halfof those living in eastern DRC believe MONUSCO protects civilians at all, andnearly halfof the eastern population thinks MONUSCO should leave altogether.
The narrative that offensive operations will result in better protections for the people living in eastern DRC is highly questionable and quite possibly untrue (possibly a “fib”). Not only has it failed to degrade the militias it was tasked to fight, but the FIB has potentially increased risks to civilians and diverted resources away from activities that might well serve them better.
The Security Council’s decision to lower the troop ceiling by 3,600 troops is not necessarily as drastic as it sounds. MONUSCO regularly operates at well below its authorised troop levels anyway, due to the regular rotations of troops and a high vacancy rate, and there is a possibility that as few as500 troopswill actually be sent home. In a mission the size of MONUSCO, there are many ways to trim around the edges, such as drawing down troops in less conflict-affected areas (part of the mission’s exit strategy anyway). The question is whether the UN wants to continue with business as usual, tinkering with a mission that is expensive, unpopular, and showing extremely limited success in neutralising armed groups. Or, as some experts havesuggested, should the UN use the cuts to make more drastic changes to peacekeeping more broadly?
The crux of the question in Congo is whether the FIB is good value for money. The FIB represents a significant portion of MONUSCO’s US$1.2 billion budget. This money could be repurposed to deploy more mobile units capable of responding quickly wherever violence arises in Congo, and specifically tasked with defending Congolese under imminent risk. Unlike the FIB, these units would be equipped to quickly provide a protective presence in any areas where the risk to civilians was imminent, access hard to reach areas, and stay in place for several days without re-supply. This “rapidly deployable battalion” model hasalready been tried in MONUSCO, with some positive results, and could be replicated with the savings from the FIB. In fact, the Security Council has alreadyexpressed enthusiasmfor making MONUSCO “more active, more agile, more mobile.” Removing the FIB could also have the positive impact of energizing the other troops in the mission, who could no longer point to the FIB as the “robust part” of MONUSCO.
There are also cheaper options for beefing up MONUSCO’s response apart from troops. Some of the money saved by getting rid of the FIB could go into improving the ability of the UN to track and disrupt the criminal networks bleeding the country dry of natural resources and feeding militias in the east, or toimproving early warning networks. These could be established at a fraction of the cost of maintaining the FIB, and would likely have more impact.
The risks to civilians will almost certainly grow in the coming months as President Kabila looks for any reason to cling on to power beyond the end of the year. Bombing rebel positions in the jungle is the last thing MONUSCO needs to be doing with its limited resources. Instead, the UN should use the Security Council’s cuts to help it take a tough decision: end the experiment with offensive combat and focus on helping the Congolese weather the coming storm.
