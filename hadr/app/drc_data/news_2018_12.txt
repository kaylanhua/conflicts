UN envoy urges Uganda to mobilize AU on elimination of DR Congo rebels - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- The UN special envoy for the Great Lakes region has urged Uganda to mobilize the African Union (AU) and regional bodies in efforts to eliminate negative forces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Said Djinnit, in a statement issued by Uganda's ministry of foreign affairs, on Tuesday made the call while meeting Sam Kutesa, Uganda's minister of foreign affairs.
Djinnit said the AU and regional bodies like the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Southern African Development Community should come together and propose solutions to wipe out the Allied Democratic Force (ADF) rebels and also repatriate the M23 fighters.
Kutesa said Uganda will cooperate but also called on the UN to coordinate the process of implementing the agreed-on position of mobilizing other countries to come on board.
The two officials agreed that negative forces in the region should be wiped out by February next year.
The meeting comes after another planned meeting between Uganda and DRC on a proposed joint operation to fight the ADF rebels holed up in eastern DRC.
Brig. Richard Karemire, Uganda's military spokesperson told Xinhua on Nov. 28 that the meeting was postponed to allow for more consultations.
ADF is a Ugandan rebel group causing mayhem in eastern DRC. The outfit in one of its recent deadly attacks killed eight UN peacekeepers and at least 12 DRC soldiers in North Kivu province.
The soldiers were killed during joint operations of the UN peacekeeping mission and DRC troops against the insurgents in Beni territory.
Several attacks by the ADF have forced thousands of Congolese to flee to neighboring Uganda.

Title: Two Rwandan soldiers killed by rebels on DRC border: Kagame | News24
Thursday, 29 August
15 Dec 2018
At least two Rwandan soldiers in an attack by rebels who had crossed the border from the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Paul Kagame said on Friday.
The Rwandan army blamed the December 9 assault in the country's restive east on Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
"A group arrived from DRC and attacked our positions, I think they killed two or three of our soldiers," Kagame said at a news conference.
"A number of them (the rebels) were killed and their bodies taken away by their friends in the DRC. We are seeking clarification and cooperation from the Congolese authorities," he added.
The FDLR, set up in 2000, includes several leaders who took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis were slaughtered by the Hutu majority government.
Eastern DRC has been a theatre of ethnic violence for 20 years, fuelled in part by the desire to control valuable mineral resources and farmland.
The FDLR is regularly accused of atrocities on Congolese soil.
Tensions are rising in the vast, unstable country ahead of the December 23 election when Congolese voters will choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila who has remained in power as a caretaker leader even though his second and final elected term ended nearly two years ago.

Eastern DRC has been a theatre of ethnic violence for 20 years
Two Congolese soldiers were killed in clashes with Rwandan pro-Hutu rebels after two of their leaders were arrested in an eastern frontier region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a military spokesman said Monday.
The Congolese army has battled militants from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) since Sunday at the foot of the Mikeno volcano near the Rwandan border, according to Guillaume Djike, the army spokesman for Goma in the troubled region of North Kivu.
"We deplore the deaths of two soldiers," he said.
"On Saturday, two important FLDR individuals were arrested by military intelligence services some 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Goma," he said. "Every member of the FDLR must be repatriated to Rwanda and they will be."
The arrest had been announced on Twitter by the Rwandan state minister for foreign affairs, Olivier Nduhungirehe, who described the FLDR as a "genocidal and subversive movement operating in the east of the DRC".
The FDLR includes several leaders who took part in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis were slaughtered by the Hutu majority government. The group was a group set up in 2000 to oppose Rwanda's post-genocide leader, Paul Kagame.

In a separate incident the World Food Programme said that one of its drivers had been shot and killed in the same area of North Kivu.

Title: Un tribunal de Alemania revoca parcialmente la condena contra un antiguo líder de las FDLR | Teinteresa
Teinteresa
Información para personas. Sin etiquetas
20 de diciembre de 2018PorEUROPA PRESS
El tribunal, con sede en la ciudad de Karlsruhe, ha ordenado revisar la condena a trece años de cárcel contra Ignace Murwanashyaka –antiguo líder de la rama política de las Fuerzas Democráticas para la Liberación de Ruanda (FDLR)– por su papel en crímenes de guerra.
El hombre nació en Ruanda y vive en Alemania desde los años ochenta. En el país europeo fue el principal representante internacional de las FDLR y coordinó sus actividades, estando en contacto con la cúpula del grupo en Ruanda.
Las FDLR huyeron a RDC tras el genocidio de 1994 en Ruanda, en el que murieron 800.000 tutsis y hutus moderados. El grupo ha sido responsable de la muerte de centenares de personas en ataques ejecutados desde entonces en territorio congoleño.
Así, ha sostenido que no existen pruebas sustanciales que respalden la condena, emitida por la responsabilidad de Murwanashyaka en varios ataques perpetrados en RDC en 2008 y 2009, que se saldaron con decenas de muertos.
Por ello, ha ordenado que se repita el juicio contra él por estos cargos, si bien ha confirmado su condena como líder de una organización terrorista. Asimismo, ha ratificado la sentencia a ocho años de cárcel contra su ‘número dos’, Straton Musoni, según el diario alemán ‘Zeit’.
Musoni vivía junto a Murwanashyaka en Baden-Wurttemberg desde finales de los ochenta. Ambos fueron detenidos en 2009 y condenados en 2015 por su papel en la estructura del citado grupo armado.
La presencia de las FDLR en el este de RDC es uno de los factores fundamentales del conflicto en el país, que se ha saldado hasta la fecha con alrededor de cinco millones de muertos.
El grupo fue establecido por hutus acusados de participar en el genocidio en Ruanda en 1994 y que posteriormente establecieron su base en RDC, convirtiéndose en uno de los grupos rebeldes más poderosos del país.

Title: Nine slain in new massacre in eastern DR Congo - Digital Journal
Hi, what are you looking for?
By
Published
Suspected militiamen killed nine civilians in a fresh attack in the Democratic Republic of Congo's troubled east, government officials and the military said Tuesday.
The massacre occurred overnight in the town of Oicha, in the Beni region, local administrator Donat Kibwana told AFP.
The assailants were suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an armed group blamed for hundreds of killings since 2014.
"They entered Oicha late at night, they pillaged and made off with farm animals. We lost nine people in the attack," Kibwana said.
The toll was confirmed separately by military spokesman Mak Hazukay.
"The ADF got around our position and carried out their dirty work in eastern Oicha... there are nine civilians dead," he said.
Local teacher Prospere Kasereka said "the ADF arrived in my area around 7.30pm. They started looting, smashing down doors and firing guns."
He added: "I fled when they got in my house. I saw the bodies of nine inhabitants this morning."
The ADF is a shadowy Islamist-rooted group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 under the leadership of Jamil Mukulu, a Christian turned Muslim.
Forced out of Uganda, it operates in the border area in the DRC's North Kivu province, an area where other armed groups are also active.
It has been blamed for recruiting and using child soldiers, killing hundreds of civilians since 2014, as well as 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers who died in an attack in December 2017.
In the past month, 47 deaths in Beni have been attributed to the ADF, including seven UN peacekeepers who were killed in an operation against the group, according to an AFP toll.
The violence has cast a shadow over efforts to roll back an outbreak of Ebola in eastern DRC and could hamstring efforts to hold presidential and legislative elections in the region on December 23, the UN says.

Suspected militiamen killed nine civilians in a fresh attack in the Democratic Republic of Congo's troubled east, government officials and the military said Tuesday.
The massacre occurred overnight in the town of Oicha, in the Beni region, local administrator Donat Kibwana told AFP.
The assailants were suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an armed group blamed for hundreds of killings since 2014.
"They entered Oicha late at night, they pillaged and made off with farm animals. We lost nine people in the attack," Kibwana said.
The toll was confirmed separately by military spokesman Mak Hazukay.
"The ADF got around our position and carried out their dirty work in eastern Oicha... there are nine civilians dead," he said.
Local teacher Prospere Kasereka said "the ADF arrived in my area around 7.30pm. They started looting, smashing down doors and firing guns."
He added: "I fled when they got in my house. I saw the bodies of nine inhabitants this morning."
The ADF is a shadowy Islamist-rooted group that arose in western Uganda in 1995 under the leadership of Jamil Mukulu, a Christian turned Muslim.
Forced out of Uganda, it operates in the border area in the DRC's North Kivu province, an area where other armed groups are also active.
It has been blamed for recruiting and using child soldiers, killing hundreds of civilians since 2014, as well as 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers who died in an attack in December 2017.
In the past month, 47 deaths in Beni have been attributed to the ADF, including seven UN peacekeepers who were killed in an operation against the group, according to an AFP toll.
The violence has cast a shadow over efforts to roll back an outbreak of Ebola in eastern DRC and could hamstring efforts to hold presidential and legislative elections in the region on December 23, the UN says.

Title: Rebels strike again near Beni as DRC Ebola total hits 477 | CIDRAP
© MONUSCO, Sylvain Liechti / Flickr cc
A pair of violent attacks that resulted in civilian deaths were reported yesterday in Beni, one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) main Ebola hot spots, as six more cases were reported in the ongoing outbreak.
In other developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed new details about its investigation into a spurt of new cases in Komanda, a part of Ituri province that had not reported cases for several weeks.
Beni has been the setting for several attacks in recent months, some of which led to temporary pauses in Ebola response operations. In the latest incidents, Ugandan rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) killed 18 civilians in two separate attacks, according to a report from Radio Okapi, a news network run by the United Nations mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and the Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss nongovernmental organization.
According to the report, the first incident occurred yesterday morning in Mangolikene, about 9 miles northeast of Beni, where the ADF attacked farmers in their fields, killing 13. The second attack occurred yesterday evening in Paida district in the eastern outskirts of Beni, killing 5 people and wounding 2 more.
The fresh violence comes about 3 weeks after a joint mission between MONUSCO and DRC government fighters targeted an ADF stronghold near Beni, which resulted in the deaths of 7 UN peacekeepers.
In its daily update today, the DRC's health ministry reported six more confirmed Ebola cases, including four in Katwa, located east of Butembo, and two in Beni. Also, two more deaths were reported, one from Beni and the other from Butembo.
The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 477 cases, 429 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. The fatality count has risen to 275.
Health officials are still investigating 94 suspected Ebola cases.
In vaccination developments, the health ministry said wide-belt immunization, presumably broader than the standard ring vaccination strategy, is under way in reemerging hot spots, Komanda and Mabalako health zones. Overall, 41,817 people have received Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine since the campaign began in August.
In a weekly snapshot of the DRC's Ebola outbreak, the WHO said the event continues to be a "multifaceted challenge," but it is still confident the outbreak can be contained with proven steps and new tools, such as vaccines and therapies.
The agency said new cases in Komanda and Mabalako emerged after more than two Ebola incubation periods had passed with no new cases, underscoring the risk of reintroduction and the need to keep up enhanced surveillance. Komanda's cases are linked to an infection of a mother and her children in Beni.
"While insecurity in Komanda will challenge the response activities, control measures including contact tracing and vaccination were initiated soon after the detection of cases," the WHO added.
Another factor fueling some of the latest cases is inadequate infection prevention and control practices at public and private health centers, a situation known to amplify Ebola outbreaks. So far, 44 health workers have been infected in the outbreak—12 fatally—and at least one of the newly reported patients likely contracted Ebola from an infected health worker during a routine medical visit, the WHO said.
Also, the WHO addressed concerns about the disproportionate number of women and children infected in the outbreak. So far, females account for 62% of cases, and of that group 18 were pregnant and 7 were breastfeeding or had recently delivered.
The virus has infected 27 babies younger than 1 year old, and killed 21 of them. Nine infections have been recorded in newborns, and children younger than 15 years make up 24% of all of the outbreak cases.
Several factors are probably contributing to the higher burden in women and children, the WHO said, including exposure in health settings, participation in traditional burial practices, transmission within families, and differences in health-seeking behavior. A spike in malaria cases and inadequate infection control practices in healthcare settings are also probably playing a role in in high Ebola rates in children, according to the report.

Los fondos de inversión redujeron su patrimonio en agosto por una cantidad de 581 millones de euros, lo que supone una caída del 0,2%, hasta situarse en 336.042 millones de euros, según los datos de Inverco publicados este lunes.La patronal del sector ha detallado en un comunicado que este descenso en agosto se debió en exclusiva a las rentabilidades negativas experimentadas en los mercados bursátiles, puesto que los partícipes mantuvieron su ritmo inversor al registrar nuevos flujos de entrada.En tanto, el patrimonio de los fondos se ha agrandado en casi 29.843 millones desde el cierre de 2022, lo que implica una subida del 9,7%.Desglosando por categorías, aquellas vocaciones con perfil más conservador fueron las que mayores incrementos registraron en sus patrimonios. En términos absolutos, los Fondos de Renta Fija fueron los que mayor incremento registraron en sus patrimonios (1.126 millones de euros), debido tanto a los nuevos flujos de entrada en estas vocaciones como a las rentabilidades aportadas por los mercados de bonos.Estas vocaciones lideran en términos absolutos el incremento patrimonial del año con casi 17.000 millones de euros (18,9% respecto al año anterior), centrados principalmente en aquellos con mayor duración de sus carteras (13.553 millones de euros).Por el lado contrario, los Fondos de Renta Variable Internacional fueron los que experimentaron un mayor retroceso (1.036 millones de euros) debido casi en exclusiva a los ajustes de valoración en sus carteras por efecto de mercado.De esta manera, los fondos de inversión han registrado en julio captaciones netas positivas por 803 millones de euros y encadenan 34 meses consecutivos. En los primeros ocho meses del año, los fondos de inversión han acumulado alrededor de 15.873 millones de euros de flujos positivos.La rentabilidad de los fondos ha experimentado en agosto una rentabilidad media positiva del -0,41%. En lo que va de año, los fondos de inversión aportan una rentabilidad media del 4,65%.

Title: The tentative ties between the Allied Democratic Forces and ISIS
While Islamic State has suffered heavy losses over the past few years, statements from leaders such as U.S. President DonaldTrump, Russian President VladimirPutin, and former Iraqi prime ministerHaider al-Abadiof its defeat were, predictably, incorrect. The jihadist group has shifted to adeadly insurgency in Iraq, continues tohold off Syrian Democratic Forcesoperations around Hajjin, and its affiliates around the world continue to carry out attacks andattract foreign fighters.
Yet the group’s oft-cited statement – baqiya wa tatamadad – calls for remaining and expanding, not just surviving.
In the jungles of the Democratic Republic of Congo an old insurgency may have a new trajectory, giving rise to the possibility of ISIS expanding its global conflict there.
Late last month, the U.S. Department of State shut the American embassy in Kinshasa for several days due to a “terrorist threat.” Although the nature of the threat was not specified, Reuters on Mondayreportedthat reported diplomatic sources as saying the closure was due to the arrest of Tanzanian nationals linked to a Ugandan-led Islamist group. Other organizations, includingVoice of AmericaandCNN, reported U.S. officials as saying the threat came from an ISIS-affiliated group.
The embassy was set to reopen on Tuesday, December 4.
TheAllied Democratic Forceswasfoundedin 1995 at Bunia in the DRC, bymembersof the Uganda Muslim Freedom Fighters who had been driven out of Uganda.
The ADF had the statedgoalof overthrowing the Ugandan government and setting up an Islamic state, and DRC offered a location from where they could launch attacks in Uganda. The ADF built up decent relations with local Congolese to assist in this goal, and received somesupportfrom the Congolese and Sudanese governments.
The ability of the ADF to follow their stated goal has shifted over time. During the late 1990s they stagedmany attacksin Uganda, including several targeting civilians. Uganda responded by stepping up counter-insurgency efforts and invading DRC in 1998.
By the early 2000s the ADF had been severely weakened, limiting its ability to strike in Uganda. Beginning in 2005 the DRC, backed by a United Nations peacekeeping force, MONUSCO, launched its first major operation against the ADF. Many more would follow, shifting the ADF’s focus from targeting Uganda to defending against DRC assaults.
Starting in 2014, against the backdrop of another intensive Congolese army operation, a series of massacres against civilians were carried out in Beni Territory, an area where the ADF operates. The DRC government holds the ADFresponsiblefor these massacres in the main but others, including U.N. investigators, believe they are just one ofmany factions involved. This includes the Congolese army whoaccordingto a 2017 report by the Congo Research Group, were responsible for orchestrating massacres in Beni from 2014 to 2016.
The ADF has extensive roots in Uganda’sIslamist circles. Many of the group’s leaders and early members were key figures in Uganda’s Jamaat al-Tabligh movement and were involved in the country’s Salafist movements.
In 1991 around 1,000 people, including future ADF leader Jamil Mukulu, stormed the headquarters of the Ugandan Muslim Supreme Council, an organization comprising all Muslim leaders in Uganda, over a disagreement with senior clerics’ interpretation of Islam. Four police officers and an activist were killed in the violence.
Around 400 people were jailed for their involvement, including Mukulu. Upon his release in 1993, Mukulu formed the Saalaf Foundation which included an armed wing, Uganda Muslim Freedom Fighters, the precursor group to the ADF. Ugandan forces quickly drove them out of Uganda into the DRC where the remnants would form the ADF.
Despite these roots, the actual importance of Islam for the ADF has been debated. While expressing an intention to create an Islamic state in Uganda and leaders using extremist rhetoric in statements. Academics and researchers have argued this may not be the primary motivation of the group but one of many factors, or even a tool to assist in more important political goals.
An ex-combatant interviewed in 2002 said “the agenda of the ADF was purely political.” and “Islam was a ticket, so the leaders disguised their political motives in religion.” Since its formation in 1995, the group has allied with the secular National Army for the Liberation of Uganda as the ADF-NALU.
It is known that within the ADF’s camps the group followed a version of Sharia law. A practice that was implemented more strictly starting around 2003, according to a member of the group. These camps also held schools where children received Islamic education as well as teaching in other subjects, mosques, and Islamic banks.
However, in the more recent stages of its insurgency, there has been a shift with extremist ideology taking a more central position. The Congo Research Group, an independent research group focusing on conflict in DRC,analyzed35 videos posted on private social media channels including Telegram, Facebook, and YouTube between 2016 and 2017. The videos, many of which were posted by one member of the ADF, reveal a “shift in the rhetoric employed by the movement, from a war against the Ugandan government to a broader struggle for Islam,” according to the researchers.
Various videos feature extremist rhetoric, such as an ADF member saying what makes him happy is “to slaughter the kafiris” (non-believers), a narrator referring to dead Congolese troops as kafiris who were “trying to fight Islam” and another ADF fighter saying, “We slaughter infidels who hate the Quran.”
A flag reminiscent of those used by other jihadist groups like ISIS and some al-Qaeda branches was also featured in several of the videos. The ADF also adopted a new name, Madina at Tauheed Wau Mujahedeen (MTM) – The City of Monotheism and Holy warriors, according to the Congo Research Group.
The earliest references to this were stamps bearing the namefoundby U.N. investigators in 2012 on ADF internal documents. It was also used in several of the videos. Outside of ADF-produced materials, the name can occasionally be seen – in one instance the flag was used by a Kenyan man as his Facebook cover photo.
The threat to the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa, reportedly caused by the arrest of a cell of Tanzanian ADF members, suggests this shift has spread from rhetoric to action.
A few factors may have led to this shift.
In 2015, ADF leader Mukulu wasarrestedin Tanzania, and Musa Baluku took control. Baluku had to unite a fragmented group that, due to the 2014 Sukola I operation by DRC forces, had suffered heavy casualties and was geographically disjointed.
Placing an emphasis on extremist Islamic ideology over other factors may have been a tactic to unify the remaining forces, help assert control, and strengthen the group.
The loss of the ADF’s secular NALU allies in 2007 to a political settlement with Uganda also helped pave the way to increasing extremism.
The ADF has often been accused of working with other extremist groups around the world.
Uganda’s government in 2005 accused the group of working with al-Qaeda, though no evidence was provided.
Monusco, the U.N. stabilization mission in DR Congo, gave in 2014 the even more credulousclaimthat the ADF had links to al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and even Hezbollah. This was based on uncorroborated statements by asingle, widely inaccurate, source. Multiple organizations including U.N. special investigators have concluded that there was no evidence linking the ADF with any of those groups.
Despite these previous allegations there is now evidence for tentative ties and increased ideological alignment between the ADF and other extremist groups.
Based on its analysis of ADF videos, the Congo Research Group has argued the group has been “making a tentative attempt to align itself with other militant Islamist groups.” It appears that the alignment with ISIS is was most successful.
In February, DRC soldiers found an ISIS-produced book on the body of a dead ADF militant. This book was identified as توعية الرعية بالسياسة الشرعية – ‘Making the citizen subjects aware of Shari’i politics’– and was produced by the Office of Research and Studies and published by Al Himmah Library. Among its various responsibilities, theOffice of Research and Studiesproduces religious texts studied at ISIS camps, while Al Himmah Library is the official ISIS organization responsible for book publication.
This text is readily available online, so its presence isn’t conclusive evidence of a physical connection between the ADF and ISIS. But it does suggest an ideological connection to ISIS among ADF members. This is supported by areportby the Hiraal Institute, a security think tank based in Somalia, that said individuals within the group have expressed support for ISIS.
In a video that surfaced online in October 2017, an Arabic-speaking ADF militant appears topledge allegiance to Islamic Stateand calls on individuals to join them in DRC. The speaker states “I swear to God that this is Dar al-Islam [House of Islam] of the Islamic State in Central Africa.”
The video featured the MTM name and the newer flag. It did not feature any of the group’s high-ranking Ugandan leadership, nor was it officially recognized by ISIS in any form, so it cannot be viewed as an official pledge of allegiance, or bayat, by the group. It does however show further support for ISIS within the ADF. The video was also popular among ISIS supporters, and was widely shared by pro-ISIS media.
Since 2017, ADF in the DRC has become a destination for Islamic State recruits from Kenya, with would-be ISIS members detained while attempting to join the ADF, according to the Hiraal Institute report.
This suggests that some regional radical Islamists view ADF ideology as similar enough to ISIS’s for it to be attractive to would-be foreign fighters. The October 2017 video likely played a significant role in this.
As well as an ideological shift that appears to bring the ADF more in line with ISIS, there are claims of more concrete connections between the two groups.
Speaking in May, the Director-General of Uganda’s Internal Security Organization Colonel Kaka Bagyendaclaimedthat there is proof ISIS has collaborated with the ADF, though he offered no evidence to support this assertion. Considering the Ugandan government’s previous efforts to define the narrative around the ADF to suit its needs, including unsubstantiated claims that the ADF had ties with al-Shabaab, such an unsupported statement should be looked upon with caution.
Other, more credible, claims have also been made linking the ADF to ISIS.
The Hiraal Institute report stated that in 2016: “ADF members are said to have reached out to the Islamic State in Libya and Syria to discuss a formal relationship between the two groups.”
This was based on information obtained from detainee debriefs of Kenyan recruits to the ADF.
However, the level of knowledge would be Kenyan recruits would have about a high-level decision such as this is debatable, especially considering the secretive nature of the ADF.
The most concrete link between the ADF and ISIS came with the arrest of a pair of ISIS financial facilitators in Kenya.
Waleed Ahmed Zein and Halima Adan Ali werearrestedin July after they had allegedly established an extensive ISIS financial facilitation network that spanned Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas.
During a period from early 2017 to June 2018, Waleed moved over $150,000 through this network. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Waleed in September and listed him as aSpecially Designated Global Terrorist, claiming that he “established an intricate worldwide financial network to facilitate funds transfers for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,” and that funds were “sent to ISIS fighters in Syria, Libya, and Central Africa,” a reference to DR Congo.
According to the Congo Research Group citing an ADF defector and sources close to the U.S. government, Waleed sent money to the ADF. They also cited Ugandan officials as saying he was in contact with the group.
Kenyan press also reported at the time of the arrests that Halima had sent funds to ISIS fighters in the DRC. The amount of money transferred is unknown but a pair of ISIS financial facilitators supplying funds to the ADF, regardless of the amount, represents a connection between the ADF and a global jihadi group that had not previously existed.
While there is no evidence that Waleed or Halima played a role beyond sending funds to the ADF, their alleged connections illustrate the potential for lines of communication between the ADF and ISIS.
As well as being in contact with the ADF, Waleed also had contacts in Syria. They claim he sent funds to ISIS fighters, while his father and several other family members joined ISIS in Syria, and that one of the women, named Zeituni Ali, who traveled with his father ended up marrying a high-ranking ISIS member known as Salah.
The extent of Waleed’s communications with the ADF and ISIS, as well as how high his contacts were in the groups’ hierarchies, is unknown.
The Congo Research Group, in their analysis of ADF videos, argued the group was “making a tentative attempt to align itself with other militant Islamist groups” with its shift to more extreme ideology.
The presence of ISIS-produced ideological material on a fighter, ISIS-supporting Kenyans viewing ADF as a suitable organization to join, and an ADF video shared widely on pro-ISIS media apparently showing fighters pledging allegiance to the group suggests ISIS is the organization the ADF is aligning most strongly with.
Even if less-substantiated claims about contact between ISIS and the ADF are excluded, the cases of Waleed and Halima provide compelling evidence that there is a connection deeper than increasing ideological alignment between the two, as does reported U.S. officials viewing a threat from the ADF to the U.S. embassy in DRC as coming from an ISIS-affiliated group.
Even if tentative ties between ISIS and the ADF are confirmed, the extent to which they may develop in the future is hard to discern. If the ADF desires and is able to establish contact regarding a more-formal relationship, there is no guarantee ISIS will be open to such an arrangement. There is no certainty a more complex relationship between them will ever develop.
However, even barring any formal ties, the ADF’s shift to an organization with a greater emphasis on extremist Islamic ideology and jihadist goals presents issues for the DRC and opportunities for the ADF. It has helped to draw recruits and funding, presents a unifying factor for a disjointed organization, and will likely lead to increased violence in an already conflict-stricken region.

Uganda seeks joint operations with DR Congo in Ebola fight - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Although Uganda has not recorded any case of Ebola outbreak, the country is on high alert as chances of a likely spread from neighboring eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are high.
The common border between Uganda and eastern DRC is porous and there is a lot of human activity. Large numbers of people cross the border daily for trade, health services, education and cultural relationships.
Huge numbers of Congolese are also fleeing to Uganda seeking refugee due to fighting back home.
According to Uganda's ministry of health, the Congolese government recently intercepted five families with affected persons trying to cross into Uganda.
All this has caused concern to Uganda which fears that the deadly disease can easily spread beyond its current epicenter in DRC.
Uganda's health minister Ruth Aceng is currently heading a delegation to DRC where they are discussing with their Congolese counterparts on measures how they can jointly fight the hemorrhagic fever.
In a meeting held on Wednesday in the Congolese town of Goma, Aceng said the two countries need to have high level coordination mechanisms and common platform to address common challenges in containing the Ebola outbreak.
Aceng, according to a ministry of health statement issued here on Wednesday told the Congolese delegation, head by Oly Ilunga, health minister that there is need to strengthen cross-border surveillance by encouraging collaboration between the local health zone in DRC and the border districts in Uganda.
She also said there is need to deploy technical experts between the two countries when required. She added that joint risk assessments and joint response, in case of Ebola cases on the border line are needed.
"We look forward to a formal engagement with your teams at the border health zones with my teams in the border districts," Aceng told the meeting.
Minister Ilunga said fighting in some parts of eastern DRC have hampered government's response to the Ebola outbreak. He said there are areas with the Ebola outbreak but are under the control of local militias known as the Mai Mai. He noted that to access these areas, the health officials have to negotiate with the militias.
He said areas controlled by the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have not had any Ebola response interventions.
"The security situation in the jungles controlled by the ADF has made it difficult for us to respond to the outbreak in these areas. We have not made any contact with the ADF," Ilunga said.
The Congolese minister said that besides the challenges, the vast central African country is fighting the outbreak. According to the DRC ministry of health, over 10,000 health care workers in the affected areas have been vaccinated against the disease.
UGANDA PREPAREDNESS
Health experts on the Ugandan side of the border say they have put up strong measures to combat the disease just in case it spreads to Uganda. There is an ongoing vaccination exercise of health care workers in the five border districts that face the most risk.
World Health Organization (WHO) in a statement on Nov. 25 said over 1,000 health care and frontline workers have so far been vaccinated out of the targeted 2,000. The vaccination started on Nov. 7.
The global health body said at least 2,100 doses of experimental rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine are currently available in the east African country, while supplementary doses have been requested.
Health workers in the border districts have been trained on how to handle Ebola cases.
Surveillance and teams screening people crossing the border have also been deployed.
Uganda has had five Ebola outbreaks in the last two decades, mostly along its western regions close to the DRC, according to the ministry of health. The ministry says all the outbreaks were controlled at source with limited spread beyond the localities of original incidence.
The Ebola virus is highly contagious and causes a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, generalized pain or malaise and in many cases internal and external bleeding.
Mortality rates of Ebola fever, according to WHO, are extremely high, with the human case fatality rate ranging from 50 percent to 89 percent, depending on viral sub-type.
