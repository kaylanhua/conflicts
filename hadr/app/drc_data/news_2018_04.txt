Title: Monusco facing asymmetric threats in the DRC – Mgwebi - defenceWeb
Former Monusco Force Commander Lieutenant General Derrick Mgwebi has said the United Nations is now facing asymmetric threats in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after the defeat of the M23 rebel group.
Mgwebi, who recently completed a two year term as Monusco Force Commander, said recently that technology has helped peacekeepers overcome challenges in the DRC, but improvements are needed.
Between 2016 and 2018, Lt. Gen. Derrick Mbuyiselo Mgwebi served as force commander of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), the largest U.N. peacekeeping mission in the world. Mgwebi has more than 35 years of military experience and has held multiple senior posts for the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), including his current position as chief of joint operations. Previously, he served as the SANDF director of special forces, director of training and operations, military secretary at the Ministry of Defence, and director of the South African Army Infantry Formation. From 2004 to 2006, he served as force commander for the U.N. Operation in Burundi.
He spoke to Africa Defense Forum (ADF) from MONUSCO headquarters in Kinshasa.
ADF: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) poses unique challenges due to its size, difficult geography and the fact that it has only 2,250 kilometers of paved roads. How have you worked to overcome these daunting challenges?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: For the past 15 years or so we have, as a MONUSCO force, been more static in the sense that we’ve been occupying certain hot spots where we put up company operating bases, and we operate from those bases. But with the reduction of the force, we are required to work a little bit smarter. We’ve been directed by the Security Council through the secretary-general that we need to be flexible, we need to be versatile. Now, that flexibility demands that the forces must be able to have information through the use of technology and in terms of situational awareness, not only using the UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), but we’re going to have to collect intelligence and be able to monitor the geolocation of those who are communicating with bad intention and be able to have an idea of where they’re operating. Then, to be more flexible and agile, you need air assets. You must be informed by the intelligence, get it in time, and conduct intelligence-driven operations using helicopters. That means your forces must be trained in conducting heliborne operations: rappelling, fast-roping and be able to sustain themselves for 14 or 15 days without being resupplied. You need to be able to be there and do what needs to be done with less effort in terms of traveling by road. So we are looking at air assets, we’re looking at technology, we’re looking at a different type of force. Of course, it speaks to training and it speaks to attitude. The protection of civilians is going to be done through the projection of force.
ADF: In 2013, MONUSCO became the first peacekeeping mission in the world to use UAVs when it took delivery of five Italian-made Selex ES Falco aircraft. Has this tool helped you fulfill your mandate to protect civilians?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: It has. First of all, you’ve got different armed groups in the Congo operating in remote areas. The UAV saves you the time and effort and resources to go everywhere. The UAV can scan the environment, it can take pictures, regardless of if it’s during the day or during the night. Then you can be able to examine the object you are seeing. Is it a base of an enemy armed group or is it a base of the government armed forces? You can confirm that. Once you can determine whether they are armed people or if they’re women and children, your targeting is assisted and simplified by the UAV. Then when you go out there, you know what kind of force you need to apply depending on your analysis of the target.
ADF: MONUSCO became a different type of U.N. mission in 2013 with the creation of the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), a 3,000-troop unit that is authorized to use force to neutralize enemy armed groups. How has the FIB been used, and how has it helped your ability to take the fight to militia groups? Has it worked as intended?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: Has it had its intended effect? The answer is yes and no. The yes part of it is when it was formed it was quite clear that there was the M23 rebel group sitting out there overseeing Goma. It was wearing quite clear defense uniforms. No women, no children. It was a classical enemy that everyone could see. Therefore, coming up with the FIB, that was a good idea and that was a good tool to deal with the M23. They did very well. Since then, they came to realize that the remaining armed groups, especially the foreign ones, like the [Allied Democratic Forces], the FDLR, the LRA, they’re a different kettle of fish. They are wearing FARDC (Armed Forces of the DRC) uniforms, they have children in the army, they have women in the army. They tend to mix with the various communities. When you are ready to attack them, sometimes they change uniforms and present themselves as ordinary farmers. So it becomes more of an asymmetric kind of war, which then changes totally the attitude and the culture and the equipment and the training of the original FIB. So, in 2016, when I came on board as the force commander, I realized this. We have gone back to the member states, those who contribute to the FIB, and said let’s look at the culture of the FIB, let’s look at the training, the equipment, and begin to say: “Are they really ready to engage in this asymmetric war?” We all agreed that something needs to be done. Hence, we have begun to look at a different culture and different equipment to deal with what’s facing us. That’s why I said, ‘Yes, they’ve been successful,’ but now they’ve come up against an asymmetric situation, which we need to analyze to make sure it can be used effectively.
ADF: During the last reporting period, the secretary-general said 85 percent of “protection of civilian” alerts were responded to either by MONUSCO or the FARDC. What does this mean, and is it good enough?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: There’s a challenge that speaks to the chain of defense in the troop-contributing countries. If this is what you’d call a war, peacekeeping more belongs to platoon commanders and company commanders. The people must respond in time at that level. There is a challenge in terms of some not responding as soon as possible. We have also designed a tool to measure their effectiveness and their performance. It just gives us an example to say to the battalion commanders: “You are lagging there.” Because of the issue of possible reduction of forces, we are saying that if you are found wanting, we will be recommending that any battalion commander and his forces should be sent home because they are not effective, they are not performing, they are not responding. We are trying to encourage them, we are trying to assist them, but also we are trying to tell them that at the end of the day there must be consequences for not responding. So, 70 to 80 percent, these are not the results we are happy with. We should be able to respond, if possible, 100 percent of the time. We are not perfect, but we are striving for perfection.
ADF: Should the FIB model be replicated in other peacekeeping missions?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: If you look at South Sudan, they’ve also come up with a regional protection force of 4,000 troops, so the U.N. is following that route. It’s good but there are things we need to fine-tune. One of those is the issue of command and control and the issue of unity in terms of the bigger force of the U.N. and the cohesion, which must be there. It’s a big challenge because you have a sense that some of the forces tend to look at the structure of a force like the FIB in a different manner, and the FIB themselves tend to look at the others as if they’re not here for real commitment and readiness to do what needs to be done. So the command and control structures, the working relationship, it needs strong leadership and, of course, it needs planning in terms of how you write your mandate and the rules of engagement. You need to develop a working relationship with all those serving. Because you’ll find the FIB working in an area of another brigade and they need to be supported by that brigade, but if the working relationship is not good, if command and control lines of communication are not clarified, then there’s going to be a challenge in terms of support and it can lead to dysfunction. It’s a very sensitive and very complex arrangement we have.
ADF: You restarted the cooperation agreement with the FARDC. How would you describe the cooperation between MONUSCO forces and the FARDC? Have there been successes? Are there areas that need improvement?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: The process is advanced. We’re probably on the third year. Initially it was reviewed on a six-month basis, but we felt that six months is too short a time, so we moved to an annual basis. We are now looking at what has worked and what is not working. I think, in the main, it’s working very well when we talk about joint planning, joint operations, coordinated operations. Of course, you have a challenge with the human rights due diligence policy that once you start working with the non-U.N. forces we need to make sure that the forces we’re working with are not involved and have never been involved in human rights abuses. Some of the commanders of the FARDC on the ground are a little bit sensitive to this. But we try to indicate to them that this is not only applicable to them, it is applicable to all of us and therefore it is also part of informing and educating them about the human rights due diligence policy. It facilitates our working, it also reduces some of the human rights violations by some of their junior commanders and their folks on the ground. As I’m speaking to you we are also conducting joint planning. That will cover us all the way from the northern border of DRC, which is bordering the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Uganda, and it goes all the way south into Uvira, which is bordering Burundi and Tanzania. So if you look at that Eastern front, we are conducting joint planning, which is going to lead to us conducting operations in a coordinated, joint way for the next three months; therefore there is improvement.
ADF: In April 2017 you were asked to stay on for a second term as force commander. Looking forward at the rest of your tenure, what do you think is going to be the most important thing you and MONUSCO can do to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace in the DRC?
LT. GEN. MGWEBI: I think the most important thing for the DRC is that the politics must align, and there must be good governance. All that we are doing is trying to create a conducive environment for those things to happen. We are not going to succeed unless and until the leadership, the general populace and the civil society agree that there needs to be good governance, and they need to respect the people. For me, I would love to see that the security sector reform is taken seriously. You’re giving people skills to do the right things, but if the direction they are getting at a political, strategic level is not a good direction or a good policy, then you are going to be challenged for the rest of your life. So, for me, the thing I am going to be working very hard for is that the MONUSCO security sector reform is strengthened and also work very closely with the Congolese in uniform so they begin to understand that they can get out of this challenge only if they look at how they do their administration, how they govern and manage their forces. This includes payment, taking care of the sick, and making sure that those who are deviating from the good policy direction, they take them to task, and if it comes to it, punish them for their deeds as a lesson to the others. That is what I will try to do while I am around here. At the end of the day, we want the security forces of the DRC to do it on their own, without us.

Title: 
        Région des Grands lacs: l'ONU juge nécessaire des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays
    
L'envoyé spécial du secrétaire général pour la région des Grands lacs d' Afrique, Saïd Djinnit, a souligné mardi devant le Conseil de sécurité qu'il était nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays de la région (Burundi, Ouganda, République démocratique du Congo et Rwanda) afin d' arriver à une paix durable, selon un communiqué publié mardi par l'ONU.
M. Djinnit a a indiqué qu'au cours de sa rencontre, le 29 mars dernier, avec le président congolais Sassou Nguesso, qui est Président du la Conférence internationale sur la région des Grands Lacs (CIRGL) et Président du Mécanisme régional de suivi de l'Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la RDC et la région, il a été évoqué les possibilités de renforcement des relations entre ces pays par le recours aux bons offices des dirigeants de la région.
En outre, alors qu'est examiné le renforcement de l'efficacité de la Brigade d'intervention de la Mission des Nations Unies en RDC (MONUSCO), l'Envoyé spécial a souligné l'importance de s'attaquer au financement des groupes armés en luttant contre l'exploitation illicite et le trafic des ressources naturelles.
M. Djinnit a noté que les forces négatives dans l'est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), y compris les Forces démocratiques alliées (ADF), continuent d'attaquer et terrifier la population, causant des souffrances et des déplacements et renforçant le manque de confiance entre les pays de la région.
Les Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) restent pour leur part actives et exercent le contrôle sur leurs anciens membres désarmés et les membres de leur famille vivant dans des camps de transit dont la présence renforce du reste les tensions avec la population locale. La question des anciens membres du M23 qui sont au Rwanda et en Ouganda reste encore à être traitée, a également souligné M. Djinnit.
En ce qui concerne le soutien au dialogue pacifique et au processus électoral, l'envoyé spécial a indiqué mettre l'accent sur la situation en RDC et au Burundi.
En RDC, en dépit des progrès dans la préparation des élections, des tensions persistent entre le gouvernement et l'opposition sur les conditions pour l'organisation des élections. Il a insisté sur la mobilisation du soutien régional et international pour la mise en œuvre de l'Accord du 31 décembre 2016 au sujet de la tenue d' élections crédibles et pacifiques.
Dans une déclaration à la presse publiée mardi, les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont appelé de leur côté "à soutenir les initiatives visant à promouvoir le dialogue inclusif parmi les parties prenantes nationales et souligné l'importance d'ouvrir un espace politique pour permettre la participation pleine et entière des partis politiques, de la société civile et des médias ainsi que la pleine participation des hommes et des femmes dans le processus politique".

Combattre les forces négatives
M. Djinnit a noté que les forces négatives dans l’Est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), y compris les Forces démocratiques alliées (ADF), continuent d’attaquer et terrifier la population, causant des souffrances et des déplacements et renforçant le manque de confiance entre les pays de la région.

Lutter contre l’exploitation illégale des ressources naturelles
Saïd Djinnit a relevé que la poursuite de l’exploitation illégale du commerce des ressources naturelles en RDC contribue à financer les forces négatives et priver le pays des fonds pouvant servir à la croissance et au développement. Il a invité les pays de la région à lutter contre ce commerce illégal. De même, les violations des droits de l’homme et l’impunité restent au cœur de l’instabilité dans la région.
Dans une déclaration à la presse publiée mardi, les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont appelé de leur côté « à soutenir les initiatives visant à promouvoir le dialogue inclusif parmi les parties prenantes nationales et souligné l'importance d'ouvrir un espace politique pour permettre la participation pleine et entière des partis politiques, de la société civile et des médias ainsi que la pleine participation des hommes et des femmes dans le processus politique ». Ils ont souligné que la participation des femmes aux processus politiques et de dialogue doit être davantage encouragée.
S’agissant de la situation humanitaire, les membres du Conseil ont exhorté « les gouvernements de la région, ainsi que les partenaires régionaux et internationaux, à continuer de répondre aux besoins humanitaires urgents et croissants et à rechercher des solutions durables pour les personnes déplacées, les réfugiés et les demandeurs d'asile ».

Security Council Press statement on the situation in the Great Lakes region:

The members of the Security Council met on 10 April 2018 to discuss the situation in the Great lakes region, five years after the signature of the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC) Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. They were briefed by Mr Said Djinnit, Special envoy of the Secretary General for the Great Lakes, and Amb. Raymond Serge BALE, permanent representative of the Republic of Congo, as chair of the PSC Framework Regional Oversight Mechanism.The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that the PSC Framework remains an essential mechanism to achieve durable peace and stability in the DRC and the Region. They welcomed the renewed commitment of its signatories towards its full implementation, and reiterated their call to all signatories to fulfil promptly, fully and in good faith their respective commitments under this Framework in order to address the root causes of conflict and put an end to recurring cycles of violence, and promote lasting regional development. They reaffirmed their support to the Special Envoy of the Secretary General and called for further engagement to address the remaining challenges in implementation of the PSC Framework and to promote peace and stability in the region.The Members of the Security Council commended the efforts of the African Union, as well as the subregional organizations in particular ECCAS, EAC, ICGLR and SADC, towards supporting political processes and finding peaceful solutions for the conflict situations in the region. They underlined the need for a continued and close coordination between those organizations in order to strengthen their efficiency. They welcomed, under the auspices of Angola followed by Congo-Brazzaville, the reactivation of the PSCF follow-up mechanism as a sign of a renewed commitment from the countries of the Great Lakes, and encouraged them to intensify their interactions at a significant level.The members of the Security Council urged continued regional and international support for initiatives aimed at promoting inclusive dialogue amongst national stakeholders and stressed the importance of opening political space to enable the full and free participation of political parties, civil society and the media as well as the full participation of both men and women in the political process. They stressed that women’s participation in political and dialogue processes must be further promoted. They further urged international and regional support for strengthening and improving capacity for elections and governance in the countries of the region, and called on member states in the Great Lakes region to take steps to ensure that electoral processes promote peace and security through timely, peaceful, inclusive and credible elections, in line with countries’ own constitutions and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, as applicable. They recognized that the strengthening of regional cooperation in the field of justice would contribute to the fight against impunity, and through reinforcing the confidence of the people of the region in the reliability of judicial institutions, play a stabilizing role.The members of the Security Council welcomed the commitment of the signatory states of the PSC Framework to complete without precondition the repatriation of the FDLR disarmed combatants and former M23 combatants within the shortest time frame possible. They urged the Governments of the region, with the support of the PSC Guarantors, to strengthen their collaboration to meet the agreed timeframe.The members of the Security Council urged the governments of the region, as well as regional and international partners, to continue addressing urgent and drastically increasing humanitarian needs and pursue durable solutions for internally displaced persons, refugees and asylum seekers. They commended United Nations humanitarian agencies, partners, and donors for their efforts to provide urgent and coordinated support to the population. They noted that despite increasing needs, humanitarian appeals remain underfunded across the region, and urged international partners, and the donor community at large, to step up their support to humanitarian action in the region and in the DRC.

They noted that despite increasing needs, humanitarian appeals remain underfunded across the region, and urged international partners, andthe donor community at large, to step up their support to humanitarian action in the region and in the DRC.

June 6, 2016:A major political ally of Congo President Joseph Kabila has openly suggested holding a referendum to change the constitution and let Kabila hold additional terms as president. Changing the constitution and allowing Kabila to retain the presidency is a very contentious issue and it could ignite another civil war. Donor nations and the UN have demanded that Kabila obey the constitution and over power after the November 2016 elections. If he decides to run for a third term he will violate the law. Kabila, however, does not care. He and his supporters continue to argue for delaying the election. The ostensible reasons are lack of money (budget issues) and logistical problems. The real reason is that Kabila supporters control key government offices and they have intentionally failed to meet election support deadlines. As president, Kabila controls the government’s patronage system. He has insured that he has his supporters in positions to delay the election and prevent a new government to get elected and fire them (or worse) because of mismanagement and corruption.  (Austin Bay)
June 3, 2016: Political tensions continue to increase in the Congo where opposition political leaders are now saying Congo needs a “national unity government” to replace Kabila. The constitutional limit on the number of presidential terms (no more than two) guaranteed all political parties that they would eventually have their chance to control the executive branch. Power would rotate, democratically.  Limiting presidential terms was a key agreement that went a long way to ending the Great Congo War.  The basic agreement was reached in December 2002. Now Kabila is undermining the constitution and violating the agreement. Many donor nations regard honoring presidential term limits as an indication of democratic progress and threaten to withhold aid if Kabila goes rouge.
June 2, 2016: The Congo government has agreed to register the former M23 rebel group as a legal political party. M23 has named itself the Alliance for the Salvation of the People.
June 1, 2016: Several towns and villages on the Congo-Uganda border have now been split between the countries. A joint border demarcation task force has re-drawn the border in an area where clashes have occurred frequently over land ownership. One area the new survey focused on was the border between Congo’s Oriental province and the Arua district in Uganda. Armed incidents occurred in these areas in 2009 and 2015. One Ugandan woman suddenly found her home in the Congo. She is a registered voter in Uganda and the rest of her family lives in Uganda. Apparently neither government has offered to help her move.
May 31, 2016: A federal court decision made on May 11 continues to cause political turmoil in Congo. Congolese security officials and international security advisers believe that the court decision will further radicalize Kabila’s opponents.  They expect opposition demonstrations throughout the summer and fall. The federal constitutional court ruled that current President Joseph Kabila could remain in office past November 2016 if the presidential election does not take place on time. Opponents are howling and contend Kabila supporters influenced the decision (they probably did).  For over three years opposition activists have said that they will not accept any move by Kabila to have a third term.
May 30, 2016: Moise Katumbi, Congo’s chief opposition leader and Joseph Kabila’s most powerful political opponent, has left South Africa and gone to Great Britain. Let’s follow the events. On May 5 Katumbi announced he would run for president in the November 2016 elections.  Then a government prosecutor indicted Katumbi for alleged involvement with hiring mercenaries. The prosecutor involved then agreed to let Katumbi leave the country to seek medical care. On May 20 Katumbi left the Congo claiming he needed medical treatment. It appears Katumbi has opted for exile over jail.
May 28, 2016: Seven major Congolese opposition parties -- the so called G7-- are trying to find a temporary leader. Announced presidential candidate Moise Katumbi had been the leader. However, he left Congo on May 20 as a result of government pressure.
May 27, 2016: Men armed with AK-47s murdered a Ugandan man who as fishing on Lake Albert. Locals believe the gunmen came from Congo. The gunmen also took several local men hostage and then murdered one of them. There have been disputes over fishing rights on the lake. However, investigators were not certain about the motive for the murder though it could be tied to the May 23 incident where Congolese troops allegedly killed four Ugandan policemen. Bandits also occasionally extort money from fishermen.
May 26, 2016: The government claimed that a joint Congolese Army-UN operation in North Kivu has killed 23 rebels from the Ugandan ADF/MDI (Allied Democratic Forces/Moslem Defense International). The operation began in early May. Five rebels have also been captured as well as several weapons, including rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Elements of the UN’s Intervention Brigade (IBDE) are involved in the operation.
Congo opposition parties have called for more protests against President Joseph Kabila’s attempts to secure an illegal third presidential term and many Congolese voters responded. A political protest in the North Kivu city of Goma turned violent. One protestor was killed in what observers called a “running battle” between protestors and security forces. Two protestors were wounded and at least 59 arrested. In the national capital security forces fired teargas grenades and broke up an opposition political march.
May 25, 2016: Armed gunmen kidnapped two aid workers in North Kivu province.
May 23, 2016: Uganda claim Congolese soldiers killed four Ugandan policemen who were patrolling the Ugandan side of Lake Albert. The Ugandan government has called on the Congolese government to arrest the soldiers who committed the crime.
European Union governments are responding to requests by Congolese opposition political parties that increased international pressure be brought on president Kabila to obey the law. EU foreign ministers issued a request to the Congolese government to “revive” the presidential election process. Revive suggests the EU officials think the election process is almost dead.
May 19, 2016: A government prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Congo’s chief opposition leader, Moise Katumbi, who is also is a potential presidential candidate and one who could beat Kabila in a fair election. The prosecutor charged Katumbi with hiring foreign mercenaries. The charges are trumped up and intended to intimidate Katumbi and his supporters.
May 15, 2016: The security situation in Burundi remains unstable. Supporters of President Pierre Nkurunziza continue to physically threaten and intimidate the political opposition. Several UN Security Council members still support deploying a UN police force to Burundi to help stop outbreaks of violence.
May 14, 2016: The UN Security Council is debating what to do about what UN investigation teams found when they looked into destabilizing activities in Central Africa. Allegedly, a Congolese Army general, (Muhindo Akili Mundos), recruited and armed members the ASF (Allied Democratic Forces) terrorist group and had them kill civilians in an area his forces were supposed to be protecting.  He also provided his terrorist hit team with Congolese Army uniforms. If true, this is an explosive charge. This report may be a follow-up on allegations made in February 2016 after a UN-sponsored investigation found evidence that 18 Burundian rebel operating in eastern Congo were recruited from a refugee camp in Rwanda and then trained by military instructors. Rwanda denied the allegations and noted that several western nations had concluded that Rwandan government support for Burundian rebels ceased in 2015.
May 13, 2016: Congolese opposition leader and presidential candidate Moise Katumbi has hired an American law firm to help secure U.S. support for free and fair presidential elections in the Congo. Katumbi announced he would run for president on May 5.
May 12, 2016: Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was sworn-in for his fifth term in office.  Opposition political parties still dispute the vote results of his recent re-election. Museveni came to power in 1986 after waging a successful guerrilla campaign.
May 11, 2016: Congo President Joseph Kabila got the court decision he wanted. Congo’s constitutional court has ruled that he can remain in office beyond November 2016 if the presidential election is delayed. The ruling sparked protests in the capital, Kinshasa. Political opposition leaders denounced the court ruling as a sham.
May 8, 2016:  Congo authorities now believe ADF/MDI l terrorists killed 38 in the May 3 attack on a village in the Bukavu region.
May 7, 2016: Congolese security forces have arrested General Leopold Mujyambere, the former deputy commander of the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. He was traveling in a vehicle. Police arrested him in what was called “a routine stop.”
May 6, 2016: FDLR rebels in eastern Congo have freed three Red Cross workers they kidnapped on May 3. The Red Cross said the workers would return to the city of Goma (North Kivu province) within 24 hours.
May 5, 2016: Former Katanga province governor Moise Katumbi has announced that he will run for president in November. He will be a formidable candidate.  However, on May 4 the government announced that it intended to arrest Katumbi.
May 3, 2016: An armed group attacked a village in the Bukavu area (North Kivu province). Local officials identified the attackers as members of the ADF, which now also calls itself the Moslem Defense International (MDI). The UN confirmed 17 people were murdered but the death toll could rise.

Région des Grands lacs : l’ONU juge nécessaire des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays
L’Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la région des Grands lacs d’Afrique, Saïd Djinnit, a souligné mardi devant le Conseil de sécurité qu’il était nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays de la région (Burundi, Ouganda, République démocratique du Congo et Rwanda) afin d’arriver à une paix durable.[Photo : Saïd Djinnit devant le Conseil de sécurité.]

M. Djinnit a indiqué qu’au cours de sa rencontre, le 29 mars dernier, avec le Président congolais Sassou Nguesso, qui est Président du la Conférence internationale sur la région des Grands Lacs (CIRGL) et Président du Mécanisme régional de suivi de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la RDC et la région, il a été évoqué les possibilités de renforcement des relations entre ces pays par le recours aux bons offices des dirigeants de la région.
En outre, alors qu’est examiné le renforcement de l’efficacité de la Brigade d’intervention de la Mission des Nations Unies en RDC (MONUSCO), l’Envoyé spécial a souligné l’importance de s’attaquer au financement des groupes armés en luttant contre l’exploitation illicite et le trafic des ressources naturelles.
M. Djinnit a noté que les forces négatives dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), y compris les Forces démocratiques alliées (ADF), continuent d’attaquer et terrifier la population, causant des souffrances et des déplacements et renforçant le manque de confiance entre les pays de la région.
Les Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) restent pour leur part actives et exercent le contrôle sur leurs anciens membres désarmés et les membres de leur famille vivant dans des camps de transit dont la présence renforce du reste les tensions avec la population locale. La question des anciens membres du M23 qui sont au Rwanda et en Ouganda reste encore à être traitée, a également souligné M. Djinnit.
En ce qui concerne le soutien au dialogue pacifique et au processus électoral, l’Envoyé spécial a indiqué mettre l’accent sur la situation en RDC et au Burundi.
En RDC, en dépit des progrès dans la préparation des élections, des tensions persistent entre le gouvernement et l’opposition sur les conditions pour l’organisation des élections. Il a insisté sur la mobilisation du soutien régional et international pour la mise en œuvre de l’Accord du 31 décembre 2016 au sujet de la tenue d’élections crédibles et pacifiques.
La situation reste préoccupante au Burundi
Pour le cas du Burundi, la situation politique et des droits de l’homme restent préoccupante, notamment avec le fait que le pays va vers un référendum constitutionnel. M. Djinnit a noté qu’un plus grand engagement des dirigeants de la région et de l’Union africaine, avec le soutien des Nations Unies, était nécessaire afin de revigorer le dialogue entre toutes les parties prenantes au Burundi.
Le troisième point majeur est la cause profonde des conflits dans la région. Saïd Djinnit a relevé que la poursuite de l’exploitation illégale du commerce des ressources naturelle en RDC contribue à financer les forces négatives et priver le pays des fonds pouvant servir à la croissance et au développement. Il a invité les pays de la région à lutter contre ce commerce illégal. De même, les violations des droits de l’homme et l’impunité restent au cœur de l’instabilité dans la région.
Dans une déclaration à la presse publiée mardi, les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont appelé de leur côté « à soutenir les initiatives visant à promouvoir le dialogue inclusif parmi les parties prenantes nationales et souligné l'importance d'ouvrir un espace politique pour permettre la participation pleine et entière des partis politiques, de la société civile et des médias ainsi que la pleine participation des hommes et des femmes dans le processus politique ». Ils ont souligné que la participation des femmes aux processus politiques et de dialogue doit être davantage encouragée.
S’agissant de la situation humanitaire, les membres du Conseil ont exhorté « les gouvernements de la région, ainsi que les partenaires régionaux et internationaux, à continuer de répondre aux besoins humanitaires urgents et croissants et à rechercher des solutions durables pour les personnes déplacées, les réfugiés et les demandeurs d'asile ».

Title: Feature: Peacekeeping's eye in the sky - defenceWeb
The Democratic Republic of the Congo serves as a testing ground for using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance, with the United Nations using UAVs for its peacekeeping mission.
The blue, mineral-rich waters of Lake Kivu separating Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) form a busy trade route. Merchants load goods into canoes, motorboats and ferries. The route is vital to local commerce, but all involved know the risks. The lake is not always calm, and the boats are not all sturdy.
On May 5, 2014, a type of boat known locally as a “canot rapide” capsized in strong winds. About 24 were aboard — most without life vests — and all were thrown into the choppy waters. It was the third such incident on the lake in a month. Typically, this would have meant certain death.
But on this day, two contingents of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) were holding a military exercise nearby. The mission’s unmanned aerial systems (UAS) team and the Uruguayan Riverine Company were practicing coordination between small speedboats and overhead aircraft.
When a distress call came in, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) took off to scan the waters. Remote pilots quickly located the capsized vessel, and the UAV team relayed coordinates to patrol boats. Within 15 minutes rescuers arrived and pulled 14 people from the lake.
This search and rescue operation is not a typical use of a UAV, commonly called a drone, but it helps illustrate why the aircraft are becoming more widely used in peacekeeping missions.“UAVs do a better job in protecting civilians because they provide real-time pictures of situations as they develop on the ground,” said Hervé Ladsous, undersecretary general for peacekeeping operations at the UN. “You can act more quickly and more decisively.”
Help From Above
MONUSCO became the first peacekeeping mission to use UAVs in 2013 when it took delivery of five Italian-made Selex ES Falco aircraft. The UAVs have a wingspan of 7 meters and can fly for 14 hours with a range of 150 kilometres. They are operated remotely by pilots at ground control stations and are never armed.
Painted bright white and emblazoned with the letters “U.N.,” the Falcos have night-vision cameras with electro-optical and infrared thermal technology. They can detect body heat through heavy cloud cover or a forest canopy.
Former MONUSCO UAS Chief Lt. Col. Tony Kerbey said the unmanned devices are ideal for peacekeeping’s most “dull, dirty and dangerous” tasks.“UAS have proven to be part of the solution to an intractable set of problems,” Kerbey wrote. They “save time, energy and money whilst allowing ground forces to concentrate on what’s important and avoid unnecessary deployments into potentially dangerous situations.”
The DRC mission has been a perfect testing ground for unmanned aerial surveillance. The mission is tasked with maintaining peace in a country measuring nearly 1 million square kilometres with a mere 2,250 kilometres of paved roads. The UAVs were first stationed in Goma, in the restive North Kivu province where an assortment of militias fight for control. Belligerents include the FDLR, a group of Hutu extremists who carried out the genocide in Rwanda; the M23 rebels, a group of former Congolese soldiers; and the Allied Democratic Front, a group of Islamic extremists.
Monitoring this area is difficult, and responding to distress calls is nearly impossible. Often, peacekeepers find themselves reaching villages that have already been turned to ashes.
Early on, the UAV programme registered some successes. Between May 2014 and January 2015, 438 FDLR members surrendered to U.N. and Congolese forces. MONUSCO leaders attributed this, in part, to a perception among militants that the peacekeepers had gained a tactical advantage through aerial surveillance. The drones operated “unmuffled,” meaning the loud buzzing sound could be heard from the ground and instilled fear in militia groups.“They have also a psychological effect,” said Martin Kobler, former head of MONUSCO. “Everyone knows they are flying.”
MONUSCO also used the UAVs to track illegal mining operations, illegal weapons smuggling, road conditions and displaced people.
Perhaps most important, the MONUSCO UAVs were paired with the mission’s Force Intervention Brigade. The FIB includes about 3,000 people and represents one of the most active, offensive military efforts in the history of the U.N. Adding the UAVs allowed commanders to monitor rebel groups in remote areas and order rapid response by the FIB when civilians were threatened. FIB commanders have reported that once they locate an enemy position on the ground, they call in the UAV for “target verification” to confirm that the enemy is not embedded in a civilian area. Once they confirm the target, they either call in attack helicopters or ground forces. This eye in the sky helps minimize civilian deaths.“We get much better information about what is happening on the ground,” Ladsous said. “We can see groups on the prowl. We now have a knowledge of what is happening on the ground and how to mitigate or to proactively intervene.”
Rapid and Flexible
UAV use is becoming more common in Africa and only promises to increase. Algeria, Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa are among the countries operating surveillance UAVs in their national militaries. The U.N. mission in Mali flies UAVs over its vast and dangerous north, and the U.N. mission in the Central African Republic uses them to monitor rebel activity and warn civilians of possible attacks.
Peacekeepers see the tools as a low-cost force multiplier. In MONUSCO, for example, the U.N. pays Selex $13 million annually to operate the UAVs. Although this may sound costly, it is a fraction of the mission’s $1.2 billion annual budget.
Dr. Ralph Rotte, a professor of international relations at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, has studied the use of UAVs in Africa. He said UAVs give peacekeepers two main military advantages: First, they offer improved situational awareness of enemy movements and concentrations. Second, they suppress enemy activity in certain areas and may dissuade or demoralize enemy fighters.
The key for peacekeepers, he said, is translating the data collected from UAVs into action.“Data obtained has to be analyzed effectively and fast, and has to lead to rapid, flexible reaction of forces on the ground or in the air by highly mobile and air-deployable forces or attack helicopters,” Rotte said. “So you have to have the analytical capabilities as well as combat forces available to take advantage of superior situational awareness, and certainly the political will and military leadership qualities to act with resolution.”
This has been a challenge in the DRC. Although Selex sent 10 contractors to maintain and operate the UAVs, the U.N. didn’t have enough people to analyze the images. According to a report by African Defence Review (ADR), only about 15 people were reviewing the UAV images and recommending action.“It’s fascinating, but it’s also frustrating,” Lt. Col. Matt White said. “You know you could do more.” White is a British artillery officer who was head of UAS operations for MONUSCO until October 2015.
The mission has suffered other setbacks. Due to logistical and manpower constraints, only one of the five UAVs could be flown at a time, according to ADR. The UAVs cannot fly in bad weather, which has frustrated U.N. personnel who have asked for help only to be told to wait. In 2014, one of the UAVs crashed during landing in Goma and needed significant repairs.
Getting it Right
As UAVs become more common in peacekeeping and military operations in Africa, Rotte said it is imperative to better understand the importance and the limitations of the aerial surveillance systems. He offered several guidelines:
Manage expectations: The announcement that UAVs will take to the skies as part of a peacekeeping mission will generate a lot of hope from civilians. They might expect UAVs to stop every attack or to be used in ways that are not part of the mission mandate. When these hopes are not realized, it may engender anger toward peacekeepers. Therefore, Rotte said, it is important to explain clearly to the public the limitations of UAVs and how they will be used. Transparency is key.
Not a replacement for troops: It is tempting to view UAVs as a substitute for traditional forces. This is not the case. UAVs are only effective when the situational awareness advantage they offer makes traditional forces faster and more effective.
Dialogue on data: Civilians and their elected representatives need to make clear how and when UAVs should be used and how the data collected should be managed. This could come in the form of a national, regional or continental policy on UAV use. Open conversations are needed on the subject. Organizations such as the U.N. and the African Union also must decide whether the increased information provided by UAVs gives them new responsibilities to intervene in more humanitarian events such as the Lake Kivu boat accident. Better situational awareness also will make decisions about the use of force and target selection more complicated.
Mind the civil-mil gap: Rotte said he fears that UAVs concentrated in the hands of elite units within national militaries or foreign peacekeepers will widen a gap between civilians and the military. Furthermore, the high-profile deployment of UAVs in peacekeeping missions could generate an arms race among countries or even between military branches in the same country. Some civilians in the DRC already have come to mistrust UAVs, and some aid agencies have refused offers of assistance from MONUSCO to avoid being linked to the program. This should be addressed, Rotte said.
In the end, the lesson from the first years of UAV use in the DRC is that the information they provide is only valuable when it is acted on. MONUSCO leaders believe the early returns have been positive.“If we are deaf, if we are blind, how can we do our job?” Ladsous said. “It’s simply a matter of acquiring the right tools.”

Région des Grands lacs : l’ONU juge nécessaire des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays
L’Envoyé spécial du Secrétaire général pour la région des Grands lacs d’Afrique, Saïd Djinnit, a souligné mardi devant le Conseil de sécurité qu’il était nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour dissiper la méfiance entre les pays de la région (Burundi, Ouganda, République démocratique du Congo et Rwanda) afin d’arriver à une paix durable.[Photo : Saïd Djinnit devant le Conseil de sécurité.]

M. Djinnit a indiqué qu’au cours de sa rencontre, le 29 mars dernier, avec le Président congolais Sassou Nguesso, qui est Président du la Conférence internationale sur la région des Grands Lacs (CIRGL) et Président du Mécanisme régional de suivi de l’Accord-cadre pour la paix, la sécurité et la coopération pour la RDC et la région, il a été évoqué les possibilités de renforcement des relations entre ces pays par le recours aux bons offices des dirigeants de la région.
En outre, alors qu’est examiné le renforcement de l’efficacité de la Brigade d’intervention de la Mission des Nations Unies en RDC (MONUSCO), l’Envoyé spécial a souligné l’importance de s’attaquer au financement des groupes armés en luttant contre l’exploitation illicite et le trafic des ressources naturelles.
M. Djinnit a noté que les forces négatives dans l’est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), y compris les Forces démocratiques alliées (ADF), continuent d’attaquer et terrifier la population, causant des souffrances et des déplacements et renforçant le manque de confiance entre les pays de la région.
Les Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) restent pour leur part actives et exercent le contrôle sur leurs anciens membres désarmés et les membres de leur famille vivant dans des camps de transit dont la présence renforce du reste les tensions avec la population locale. La question des anciens membres du M23 qui sont au Rwanda et en Ouganda reste encore à être traitée, a également souligné M. Djinnit.
En ce qui concerne le soutien au dialogue pacifique et au processus électoral, l’Envoyé spécial a indiqué mettre l’accent sur la situation en RDC et au Burundi.
En RDC, en dépit des progrès dans la préparation des élections, des tensions persistent entre le gouvernement et l’opposition sur les conditions pour l’organisation des élections. Il a insisté sur la mobilisation du soutien régional et international pour la mise en œuvre de l’Accord du 31 décembre 2016 au sujet de la tenue d’élections crédibles et pacifiques.
La situation reste préoccupante au Burundi
Pour le cas du Burundi, la situation politique et des droits de l’homme restent préoccupante, notamment avec le fait que le pays va vers un référendum constitutionnel. M. Djinnit a noté qu’un plus grand engagement des dirigeants de la région et de l’Union africaine, avec le soutien des Nations Unies, était nécessaire afin de revigorer le dialogue entre toutes les parties prenantes au Burundi.
Le troisième point majeur est la cause profonde des conflits dans la région. Saïd Djinnit a relevé que la poursuite de l’exploitation illégale du commerce des ressources naturelle en RDC contribue à financer les forces négatives et priver le pays des fonds pouvant servir à la croissance et au développement. Il a invité les pays de la région à lutter contre ce commerce illégal. De même, les violations des droits de l’homme et l’impunité restent au cœur de l’instabilité dans la région.
Dans une déclaration à la presse publiée mardi, les membres du Conseil de sécurité ont appelé de leur côté « à soutenir les initiatives visant à promouvoir le dialogue inclusif parmi les parties prenantes nationales et souligné l'importance d'ouvrir un espace politique pour permettre la participation pleine et entière des partis politiques, de la société civile et des médias ainsi que la pleine participation des hommes et des femmes dans le processus politique ». Ils ont souligné que la participation des femmes aux processus politiques et de dialogue doit être davantage encouragée.
S’agissant de la situation humanitaire, les membres du Conseil ont exhorté « les gouvernements de la région, ainsi que les partenaires régionaux et internationaux, à continuer de répondre aux besoins humanitaires urgents et croissants et à rechercher des solutions durables pour les personnes déplacées, les réfugiés et les demandeurs d'asile ».

Title: Feature: Peacekeeping's eye in the sky - defenceWeb
The Democratic Republic of the Congo serves as a testing ground for using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance, with the United Nations using UAVs for its peacekeeping mission.
The blue, mineral-rich waters of Lake Kivu separating Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) form a busy trade route. Merchants load goods into canoes, motorboats and ferries. The route is vital to local commerce, but all involved know the risks. The lake is not always calm, and the boats are not all sturdy.
On May 5, 2014, a type of boat known locally as a “canot rapide” capsized in strong winds. About 24 were aboard — most without life vests — and all were thrown into the choppy waters. It was the third such incident on the lake in a month. Typically, this would have meant certain death.
But on this day, two contingents of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) were holding a military exercise nearby. The mission’s unmanned aerial systems (UAS) team and the Uruguayan Riverine Company were practicing coordination between small speedboats and overhead aircraft.
When a distress call came in, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) took off to scan the waters. Remote pilots quickly located the capsized vessel, and the UAV team relayed coordinates to patrol boats. Within 15 minutes rescuers arrived and pulled 14 people from the lake.
This search and rescue operation is not a typical use of a UAV, commonly called a drone, but it helps illustrate why the aircraft are becoming more widely used in peacekeeping missions.“UAVs do a better job in protecting civilians because they provide real-time pictures of situations as they develop on the ground,” said Hervé Ladsous, undersecretary general for peacekeeping operations at the UN. “You can act more quickly and more decisively.”
Help From Above
MONUSCO became the first peacekeeping mission to use UAVs in 2013 when it took delivery of five Italian-made Selex ES Falco aircraft. The UAVs have a wingspan of 7 meters and can fly for 14 hours with a range of 150 kilometres. They are operated remotely by pilots at ground control stations and are never armed.
Painted bright white and emblazoned with the letters “U.N.,” the Falcos have night-vision cameras with electro-optical and infrared thermal technology. They can detect body heat through heavy cloud cover or a forest canopy.
Former MONUSCO UAS Chief Lt. Col. Tony Kerbey said the unmanned devices are ideal for peacekeeping’s most “dull, dirty and dangerous” tasks.“UAS have proven to be part of the solution to an intractable set of problems,” Kerbey wrote. They “save time, energy and money whilst allowing ground forces to concentrate on what’s important and avoid unnecessary deployments into potentially dangerous situations.”
The DRC mission has been a perfect testing ground for unmanned aerial surveillance. The mission is tasked with maintaining peace in a country measuring nearly 1 million square kilometres with a mere 2,250 kilometres of paved roads. The UAVs were first stationed in Goma, in the restive North Kivu province where an assortment of militias fight for control. Belligerents include the FDLR, a group of Hutu extremists who carried out the genocide in Rwanda; the M23 rebels, a group of former Congolese soldiers; and the Allied Democratic Front, a group of Islamic extremists.
Monitoring this area is difficult, and responding to distress calls is nearly impossible. Often, peacekeepers find themselves reaching villages that have already been turned to ashes.
Early on, the UAV programme registered some successes. Between May 2014 and January 2015, 438 FDLR members surrendered to U.N. and Congolese forces. MONUSCO leaders attributed this, in part, to a perception among militants that the peacekeepers had gained a tactical advantage through aerial surveillance. The drones operated “unmuffled,” meaning the loud buzzing sound could be heard from the ground and instilled fear in militia groups.“They have also a psychological effect,” said Martin Kobler, former head of MONUSCO. “Everyone knows they are flying.”
MONUSCO also used the UAVs to track illegal mining operations, illegal weapons smuggling, road conditions and displaced people.
Perhaps most important, the MONUSCO UAVs were paired with the mission’s Force Intervention Brigade. The FIB includes about 3,000 people and represents one of the most active, offensive military efforts in the history of the U.N. Adding the UAVs allowed commanders to monitor rebel groups in remote areas and order rapid response by the FIB when civilians were threatened. FIB commanders have reported that once they locate an enemy position on the ground, they call in the UAV for “target verification” to confirm that the enemy is not embedded in a civilian area. Once they confirm the target, they either call in attack helicopters or ground forces. This eye in the sky helps minimize civilian deaths.“We get much better information about what is happening on the ground,” Ladsous said. “We can see groups on the prowl. We now have a knowledge of what is happening on the ground and how to mitigate or to proactively intervene.”
Rapid and Flexible
UAV use is becoming more common in Africa and only promises to increase. Algeria, Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa are among the countries operating surveillance UAVs in their national militaries. The U.N. mission in Mali flies UAVs over its vast and dangerous north, and the U.N. mission in the Central African Republic uses them to monitor rebel activity and warn civilians of possible attacks.
Peacekeepers see the tools as a low-cost force multiplier. In MONUSCO, for example, the U.N. pays Selex $13 million annually to operate the UAVs. Although this may sound costly, it is a fraction of the mission’s $1.2 billion annual budget.
Dr. Ralph Rotte, a professor of international relations at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, has studied the use of UAVs in Africa. He said UAVs give peacekeepers two main military advantages: First, they offer improved situational awareness of enemy movements and concentrations. Second, they suppress enemy activity in certain areas and may dissuade or demoralize enemy fighters.
The key for peacekeepers, he said, is translating the data collected from UAVs into action.“Data obtained has to be analyzed effectively and fast, and has to lead to rapid, flexible reaction of forces on the ground or in the air by highly mobile and air-deployable forces or attack helicopters,” Rotte said. “So you have to have the analytical capabilities as well as combat forces available to take advantage of superior situational awareness, and certainly the political will and military leadership qualities to act with resolution.”
This has been a challenge in the DRC. Although Selex sent 10 contractors to maintain and operate the UAVs, the U.N. didn’t have enough people to analyze the images. According to a report by African Defence Review (ADR), only about 15 people were reviewing the UAV images and recommending action.“It’s fascinating, but it’s also frustrating,” Lt. Col. Matt White said. “You know you could do more.” White is a British artillery officer who was head of UAS operations for MONUSCO until October 2015.
The mission has suffered other setbacks. Due to logistical and manpower constraints, only one of the five UAVs could be flown at a time, according to ADR. The UAVs cannot fly in bad weather, which has frustrated U.N. personnel who have asked for help only to be told to wait. In 2014, one of the UAVs crashed during landing in Goma and needed significant repairs.
Getting it Right
As UAVs become more common in peacekeeping and military operations in Africa, Rotte said it is imperative to better understand the importance and the limitations of the aerial surveillance systems. He offered several guidelines:
Manage expectations: The announcement that UAVs will take to the skies as part of a peacekeeping mission will generate a lot of hope from civilians. They might expect UAVs to stop every attack or to be used in ways that are not part of the mission mandate. When these hopes are not realized, it may engender anger toward peacekeepers. Therefore, Rotte said, it is important to explain clearly to the public the limitations of UAVs and how they will be used. Transparency is key.
Not a replacement for troops: It is tempting to view UAVs as a substitute for traditional forces. This is not the case. UAVs are only effective when the situational awareness advantage they offer makes traditional forces faster and more effective.
Dialogue on data: Civilians and their elected representatives need to make clear how and when UAVs should be used and how the data collected should be managed. This could come in the form of a national, regional or continental policy on UAV use. Open conversations are needed on the subject. Organizations such as the U.N. and the African Union also must decide whether the increased information provided by UAVs gives them new responsibilities to intervene in more humanitarian events such as the Lake Kivu boat accident. Better situational awareness also will make decisions about the use of force and target selection more complicated.
Mind the civil-mil gap: Rotte said he fears that UAVs concentrated in the hands of elite units within national militaries or foreign peacekeepers will widen a gap between civilians and the military. Furthermore, the high-profile deployment of UAVs in peacekeeping missions could generate an arms race among countries or even between military branches in the same country. Some civilians in the DRC already have come to mistrust UAVs, and some aid agencies have refused offers of assistance from MONUSCO to avoid being linked to the program. This should be addressed, Rotte said.
In the end, the lesson from the first years of UAV use in the DRC is that the information they provide is only valuable when it is acted on. MONUSCO leaders believe the early returns have been positive.“If we are deaf, if we are blind, how can we do our job?” Ladsous said. “It’s simply a matter of acquiring the right tools.”

Title: Five Wildlife Rangers Killed In Virunga National Park – Reports | HuffPost UK News
Senior Editor, HuffPost UK
Five wildlife rangers and their driver have been killed in the Virunga National Park, a haven for endangered gorillas that has been under threat from poachers and rebel fighters for years.
The team in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) came under gunfire around 6 am local time (0400 GMT) while travelling to a base near the Ishasha border crossing with neighbouring Uganda, Reuters reported.
Speaking to the AFP news agency, park spokesman Joel Malembe confirmed: “We have sadly lost six rangers.” He said the gunmen were from one of Congo’s Mai-Mai militias, which first formed to resist Rwandan invasions in the late 1990s.
Located in Congo’s North Kivu province, the park is one of the most important conservation sites in the world, covering 7,800 square kilometres (3,011 miles) — three times the size of Luxembourg.
The park, its rangers and the gorillas they protect are under constant threat from poachers as well as armed groupsvying for power in the aftermath of a devastating civil warthat claimed five million lives from 1994-2003.
Earlier this month, one rangertold the Guardian: “This is not an easy profession. Losing your friends and colleagues is very painful. But we chose to do this, and we know the risks.”
The guards became famous in the 2014 film, Virunga, which followed the stories of four people trying to protect the endangered gorillas from the threats of poaching, war and the destruction of their habitat through oil exploration.
Last month, 11 people were estimated to have been killed by rebels from a Ugandan Islamist group called the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) during a raid on the city of Beni, close to Virunga, Mayor Nyonyi Bwanakawa told Reuters.
The government and United Nations have blamed the spree of massacres near Beni since 2014 on the ADF, but independent experts say some Congolese soldiers have also been involved.
Beni is one of several hotspots in eastern and central Congo where mounting violence has raised fears the massive Central African country could slide back into civil war.

It is important to note that these cases refer to the previous contingent and no cases have been reported with the current contingent of SANDF soldiers
The Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans together with the Joint Standing Committee on Defence conducted a successful joint oversight visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The purpose of the oversight visit was for the two committees to interact with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) peacekeepers in a foreign deployment area.


The visit allowed Members of Parliament to gain insight into the circumstances of deployment, as well as to be briefed on operational achievements and challenges. In the process, the delegation was updated on issues such as reimbursements made by the United Nations (UN) for services rendered, logistical issues relating to procurement and transportation to and from the mission area, the reported sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) cases, and the SANDF’s contribution to the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Monusco), in particular the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB).

The committees were informed that it was largely the contribution of the SANDF contingent to the FIB that contributed to the stabilisation of the eastern part of the DRC in recent years. In particular, their role in the elimination of the M23 rebels as a security threat, with the assistance of South Africa’s Rooivalk attack helicopters, has been widely acclaimed.

The delegation engaged with SANDF representatives on the impact of a reduction in the level of engagement of South African forces, particularly the potential implications of a withdrawal of the Rooivalk helicopters. In the case of a withdrawal, South Africa will have to review the continued deployment of other military components, such as the infantry battalion, which forms a crucial part of the FIB. The delegation agreed with the SANDF’s assessment that the withdrawal of the helicopters is likely to compromise the safety of peacekeepers, mission integrity and sustainability of the FIB, and is therefore unlikely to support such withdrawals.

The delegation also met with the special representative of the UN Secretary-General at the Monusco headquarters and South African embassy staff in Kinshasa. During engagements with the SANDF peacekeepers, they shared their achievements and concerns as experienced in the mission area.

One of the issues highlighted was the alleged involvement of South African peacekeepers in the recently reported SEA cases. The delegation condemned such acts and expressed its discomfort with the manner, timing and reporting of these cases.

It is important that these cases be investigated by the SANDF as well as the UN and both parties have been kept abreast of developments in the outstanding cases. “It is important to note that these cases refer to the previous contingent and no cases have been reported with the current contingent of SANDF soldiers,” said Mr Stan Motimele, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee. The delegation therefore requested the South African embassy in Kinshasa and the SANDF to improve its communication with the UN and the South African public in order to address some of the negativity around these reported cases.

One of the highlights of the oversight visit was the inspection of the Eringeti Company Observation Base at Beni in the North Kivu Province of the DRC, under armed escort. The delegation engaged with South African peacekeepers from 5 SA Infantry Battalion, while the Rooivalk helicopters kept a watchful eye on proceedings on the ground. Members of Parliament were able to experience first-hand the conditions under which South African troops are deployed and made several suggestions to address some of the challenges being experienced by South African soldiers.

The delegation wishes to extend its appreciation and well wishes to South African peacekeepers in the DRC as they assist the Congolese to establish a secure environment to allow for peaceful elections in the country and to continue to exhibit their military prowess in very demanding circumstances.

Title: Calculated destabilisation in the DRC


Title: ISS: Organised crime threatens Uganda's thriving gold trade - defenceWeb
Gold has become one of Uganda’s top exports, but multiple questions surround this glittering trade. On 20 February, Uganda celebrated a year since it officially launched East Africa’s first gold refinery. Inaugurated by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in the lakeside town of Entebbe, the US$15 million African Gold Refinery has since elicited a number of concerns.
A June 2017 report by environmental non-governmental organisation Global Witness titled Uganda: Undermined revealed that minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and South Sudan passed through Uganda on their way to international markets. According to George Boden, Uganda campaign leader at Global Witness, the 18-month investigation exposed ‘endemic corruption and mismanagement in the country’s fledgling mining sector’.‘The gold trade was worth $200 million to the Ugandan economy last year, but there are no official figures on where the gold came from, or where it is going,’ he told CNN shortly after the report was released.
The exploitation of the country’s gold, tin and phosphate riches has seen exponential growth in Uganda’s mineral industry in recent years. With this has come expectations of employment opportunities and economic development due to higher tax revenues. These revenues should be used to improve education, healthcare and infrastructure.
However, the Global Witness report says ‘crooked officials and international investors are profiting at the expense of Uganda’s people, environment and economy’. The report further found that miners worked under unregulated conditions, and that the mining threatened the Bwindi and Rwenzori national parks, home to almost half the world’s remaining mountain gorillas.
A second report, submitted by the United Nations (UN) Group of Experts to the UN Security Council in August 2017, identified Uganda as a major transit route for the illicit smuggling of gold from the DRC to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UN Group of Experts traced the flow of gold exploited, taxed and trafficked by armed groups – particularly the FDLR (the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) and other militia groups operating in eastern DRC.
In June 2017, the Congolese Ministry of Mines estimated that 20 tons of gold from artisanal mining were smuggled out of the DRC every year. Uganda serves as a strategic transit hub linked with dealers operating in the UAE. The UN report says Dubai is the main destination of unwrought gold sourced from artisanal miners in the DRC. It says gold smugglers use loopholes in the UAE control system, where the ‘law does not consider smuggling activity to be a crime’.
Uganda Bureau of Statistics data for 2016 confirms the findings of the two reports regarding the country’s limited local gold production. The Ugandan government also confirmed this to the UN Group of Experts in a June 2017 letter cited in the report.
However, online statistics from the Bank of Uganda show that the country’s official gold exports increased from 11 kg in 2014, worth US$237 000, to 1.1 tons in 2015, and to 8.8 tons, worth US$340 million, the highest ever recorded, in 2016. This makes gold the second largest export after coffee. From January to April 2017, Uganda officially exported 2.9 tons, already surpassing the record for the whole of 2016.
In his 2017 report, Uganda’s auditor-general revealed inconsistencies between gold export permits issued by the country’s Directorate of Geological Survey and Mines, which were only 16.3 kg compared to 8.7 tons valued at about US$340 million recorded by the Uganda Revenue Authority in the financial year 2016/17.
The figures above suggest that official gold exports from Uganda grew exponentially after the launch of the African Gold Refinery, owned by Belgian national Alain Goetz. According to official projections of the refinery, which had been in operation from 2014, it expected to export more than 10 tons of gold in 2017.
This suggests that either the gold exports from Uganda had always been largely underreported; or it originated from outside the country based on the knowledge that only small quantities are produced locally by artisanal miners, and on the findings of the UN report.
According to the UN report, Ugandan officials don’t deny that gold is smuggled from the DRC to Uganda, attributing it mainly to the porosity of the borders. Moreover, it is known that only small quantities are produced locally by artisanal miners. This seems to confirm that smuggled gold and illicit exports might, at least in part, have contributed to the exponential growth of the country’s gold exports.
If it is true that criminal networks in Uganda act with impunity in an ongoing illicit gold trade, they are likely to benefit from links to armed groups in conflict zones of eastern DRC and South Sudan. According to the UN report, the groups involved in the smuggling of gold in turn facilitate access to Congolese artisanal gold, and the flow into the international supply chain of this conflict gold, which is mined under appalling human rights conditions.
To curb this threat and contain the smuggling of gold across these countries, those responsible must be deterred. To this end, individuals and corporate entities implicated in the illicit gold exports by the UN report must be sanctioned.
Further deterrence would be achieved by tightening controls and harmonising laws in the UAE, Uganda, Congolese and other countries that are likely to be involved. This would include working with international transport policy agencies to streamline the transportation of unwrought gold.

Title: This is when and where the M23 will be closed in the next week - Croydon Advertiser
Drivers have been warned to plan ahead
We have more newsletters
We have more newsletters
Drivers who are planning to use the M23 next week have been warned to double check and plan ahead of their journeys next week, as sections of the motorway will be affected by works.
As part of scheduled road improvements, including resurfacing, it is expected that between Monday (April 23) and Monday (April 30) parts of the busy road will be closed so work can be carried out.
The improvements could be subject to change in time or date due to weather conditions or other "unforeseen circumstances," Highways England has advised in a statement, however.
Further advice has also been given to drivers on how to keep safe when travelling near where roadworks are taking place.
Below is a full list of the planned works on the M23:
M23 Junction 10 (Crawley) to Junction 9 (Gatwick Airport) - resurfacing
Works to improve journeys continue this week on the M23 between junctions 10 and 9 for resurfacing.
On Thursday (April 26) the junction 10 entry slip northbound with be closed overnight between 10pm and 6am. A clearly signed diversion will be in place via the adjacent junction. In addition there will be lane closures between junctions 10 and 9 on the northbound carriageway.
On Friday (April 27) there will be a full northbound carriageway closure at junction 10 from 10pm, this will remain in place until Monday (April 30) at 4am.
A clearly signed diversion will be in place via the A264 and A22. Alternatively traffic travelling to Gatwick will use a clearly signed diversion using the A2011 and A23.
M23 Junction 8 (M25) to Junction 10 (Crawley) - smart motorway
Work to improve journeys will continue this week by undertaking early vegetation clearance works.
On Monday (April 23) there will be lane 1 and 2 closures in both directions between junction 8 and 10 for five nights between 9pm and 6am.
Safety at roadworks
Highways England is working with the industry and road users to reduce the risks of working on the roads. For the safety of road workers and all road users, when you are approaching roadworks:


Title: M23 weekend closure: Live traffic and travel updates as motorway shuts near Gatwick Airport - Surrey Live
The motorway will be closed between junction 10 and junction 9 until 4am on Monday (April 23)
Part of the M23 northbound carriageway isclosed near Gatwick Airport all weekendfor resurfacing work.
The closure is in place from Junction 10 (Crawley) and Junction 9 (Gatwick Airport) and will last until 4am on Monday (April 23).
The southbound carriageway remains open and signed diversions for those travelling north are in place.
Traffic heading northbound to Gatwick Airport will need to leave the M23 at Junction 10 and go through Crawley, taking the A2011 Crawley Avenue to the A23 and then Airport Way.
If you want to get to the M25, you will have to go through Copthorne, onto the A22 up to Godstone and get onto the motorway at Junction 6.
We'll be bringing you all the traffic and travel updates over the weekend to help you get where you need to go, and alert you to any other disruption in the area.
The broken down car has been moved and all is well again on the southbound carriageway.
Problems relating to the northbound carriageway’s closure persist, however.
One of the southbound lanes on the M23 has been closed due to a broken down vehicle, but traffic seems to be coping.
Here’s the traffic picture this afternoon.
There’s a stretch of heavy traffic on the A22 just north of Newchapel, where extra cars that would usually take the M23 to the M25 are causing congestion.
There’s also heavy traffic around Gatwick Airport and just before junction 10 of the M23, where the closure starts.
The A23, which is part of the diversion to Gatwick Airport, is very slow due to an earlier accident.
Traffic around the airport is pretty bad in general as well, so make sure you leave enough time to get there before your flight.
Traffic on the A22 between Felbridge and Blindley Heath (on the diversion to the M25) is getting pretty heavy now.
Make sure you leave earlier than usual if you need to make that journey.
B2031ChaldonRoad at B2030 High Street is partially blocked due to an accident.
Heavy traffic building close to The Golden Lion pub.
Traffic appears to be a lot better around Gatwick today than it was yesterday.
There are still queues leading up to junction 10 though.
All quiet on the roads for the time being.
Incidentally, if anybody has taken some awesome footage of the lightning storms that ripped through Surrey last night, please send them in. we would love to use them on the website.
Send them in t surreylive@trinitymirror.com
Videos are even better.
Let’s light up the web.
Good Morning Surrey!
As was the case yesterday, the M23 Northbound will remain closed due to resurfacing work from J10 A2011 / A264 (Crawley) to J9 Gatwick Airport Spur Road.
Closed since Friday night, the route is not expected to re-open until 4:00 on 23rd April.
DIVERSIONS:
Traffic for Gatwick will exit at J10 and divert through Crawley using the A2011 Crawley Avenue and A23.
Traffic for M25 will exit at J10 and divert via A264 and A22 to M25 J6.
We will bring you all the latest traffic and breaking news as it comes in throughout the day.
There are still some heavy queues leading up to junction 10 going north, but the traffic on the diversion to the M25 via Felbridge and the A22 has eased slightly.
The rest of the M23 is fine, with the earlier car fire having been cleared.
Traffic is still queuing as a result of the car fire earlier today.
You can read our full report on the incidenthere.
Highways England has tweeted this snapshot of the southbound carriageway, near where the earlier car fire occurred.
At the other end of the M23, things are also not looking great.
To get to Gatwick, leave the M23 at junction 10 and take the A2011 towards Crawley. Then turn right at either of the roundabouts, which will get you up to the A23 and the airport, though there is some heavy traffic on the A23 in that area.
If you need to get from junction 10 to the M25, take the A264 to Felbridge and turn left onto the A22. That will get you up to junction 6 of the M25 at Godstone.
Unfortunately, there is some heavy traffic on this route as a result of the diversion.
A car fire earlier closed two lanes southbound between the M25 and junction 9 (Gatwick Airport).
The fire is now out and only one lane remains closed, but emergency services remain on the scene and there is some queuing traffic.
There appear to be some delays around junction 10, where the closure starts.
The northbound carriageway between junction 10 and junction 9 will be closed until 4am on Monday for resurfacing works.
Surrey County Council said:
“In order to carry out these works as efficiently and as safely as possible a full road closure will be in place on the London-bound carriageway of the M23 between 10pm Friday, April 20 and 4am Monday, April 23.
Unfortunately weekend closures are unavoidable due to the nature and scale of the work involved.”
