Title: U.N. concerned by military buildup around Goma - 24Tanzania.com
KINSHASA/UNITED NATIONS – Talks to end a two-year insurgency in eastern Congo stalled on Monday after the government rejected a call for amnesty for M23 rebel leaders as the United Nations expressed concern at a military buildup by the group around the provincial capital Goma.M23 rebels in GomaCongolese President Joseph Kabila’s government and the M23 rebels had agreed on two-thirds of a draft deal during recent talks in neighboring Uganda, U.N. special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mary Robinson, told the U.N. Security Council.“However, the parties found it difficult to agree on certain contentious and difficult issues that had remained problematic throughout the talks, namely the amnesty, disarmament and integration of M23,” Robinson told the 15-member council.“They have agreed to reconvene soon in order to overcome their differences,” she said via video link from Addis Ababa.During closed-door Security Council consultations after her public briefing, several diplomats said Robinson told them that Rwandan President Paul Kagame had conveyed a personal message to the M23 delegation to encourage them to reach a compromise.U.N. experts have repeatedly accused Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s neighbor to the east, of supporting the M23 rebellion, a charge Kigali has robustly denied. Kagame did not respond to an immediate request for comment on whether he had contacted the M23.Robinson visited Kagame in Kigali on Friday with envoys from the United States, the European Union and the African Union.“The president believed that while the M23 was not Rwanda’s issue, a peace agreement between the rebel group and the government of the DRC would benefit the entire region,” she told the Security Council during her public briefing.The Congolese government said it strongly opposed a blanket pardon for the commanders of the Tutsi-led rebellion and against reintegrating their fighters into the national army. M23 accused the government delegation of refusing to cooperate with its chief negotiator and of seeking a return to hostilities.Martin Kobler, head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo known as MONUSCO, told the Security Council that in recent days “we have observed considerable military build-up on both sides of the front line.”“At the same time M23 has fired twice at unarmed U.N. helicopters and has strengthened offensive positions threatening U.N. peacekeepers,” he said. “Information gathered indicates the M23 has also strengthened its frontline in the south near Goma.”M23 briefly captured Goma in November, then withdrew to pave the way for peace talks in the Ugandan capital Kampala. The rebellion’s roots lie in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu troops and gangs killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.‘EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT MUST STOP’Eastern Congo has long been one of Africa’s bloodiest battlefields. M23 emerged early last year when former rebel fighters – who were integrated into the Congolese army under a 2009 peace deal to end a previous revolt – staged a mutiny. The group takes its name from the deal on March 23, 2009, which fighters accused Kinshasa of not honoring when they deserted the army in 2012.Kobler said that since the M23 rebellion began, the United Nations had sheltered nearly 200 combatants “who consistently and credibly claim to have been recruited on Ugandan but mainly on Rwandan territory.”“This and other kinds of external involvement must stop,” he said.The United States, which has called on Rwanda to drop its support for the M23 rebels, stepped up pressure on Kigali this month by moving to block military aid over the recruitment of M23 child soldiers in its territory.Congolese forces, with the help of a new 3,000-strong U.N. Intervention Brigade that has a mandate to neutralize armed groups, successfully pushed M23 fighters away from Goma – a city of 1 million people – in August. The military defeat forced M23 to return to the Kampala peace talks.Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Monday there was total disagreement over the amnesty proposed for M23 fighters, while M23 said in a statement that it was waiting for another round of talks to be organized so the remaining points of disagreement could be discussed.Robinson said that in the draft deal under negotiation, amnesty and integration would be granted to all M23 members except those indicted for suspected war crimes, crimes against humanity, acts of genocide or gross violations of human rights.M23 combatants would have to make a written commitment to “refrain from acts of rebellion” and their amnesty would be automatically withdrawn if those pledges were violated, said Robinson, a former Irish president.Reintegration into the Congolese army would be on a case-by-case basis and conditions would include swearing allegiance to the state and constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo and committing to serve in any part of the country, she said.Robinson told Rwanda’s Kagame that a peace agreement between M23 and Kinshasa “will enable the Force Intervention Brigade to deal with other armed groups in eastern DRC including the FDLR and the ADF.”Rwanda and M23 have accused the Congolese army of collaborating with the Hutu-led Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an accusation Kinshasa rejects. The ADF is the Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces, which Uganda says is linked to Somalia’s al Shabaab.Reuters
M23 rebels in Goma
Congolese President Joseph Kabila’s government and the M23 rebels had agreed on two-thirds of a draft deal during recent talks in neighboring Uganda, U.N. special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mary Robinson, told the U.N. Security Council.
“However, the parties found it difficult to agree on certain contentious and difficult issues that had remained problematic throughout the talks, namely the amnesty, disarmament and integration of M23,” Robinson told the 15-member council.
“They have agreed to reconvene soon in order to overcome their differences,” she said via video link from Addis Ababa.
During closed-door Security Council consultations after her public briefing, several diplomats said Robinson told them that Rwandan President Paul Kagame had conveyed a personal message to the M23 delegation to encourage them to reach a compromise.
U.N. experts have repeatedly accused Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s neighbor to the east, of supporting the M23 rebellion, a charge Kigali has robustly denied. Kagame did not respond to an immediate request for comment on whether he had contacted the M23.
Robinson visited Kagame in Kigali on Friday with envoys from the United States, the European Union and the African Union.
“The president believed that while the M23 was not Rwanda’s issue, a peace agreement between the rebel group and the government of the DRC would benefit the entire region,” she told the Security Council during her public briefing.
The Congolese government said it strongly opposed a blanket pardon for the commanders of the Tutsi-led rebellion and against reintegrating their fighters into the national army. M23 accused the government delegation of refusing to cooperate with its chief negotiator and of seeking a return to hostilities.
Martin Kobler, head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo known as MONUSCO, told the Security Council that in recent days “we have observed considerable military build-up on both sides of the front line.”
“At the same time M23 has fired twice at unarmed U.N. helicopters and has strengthened offensive positions threatening U.N. peacekeepers,” he said. “Information gathered indicates the M23 has also strengthened its frontline in the south near Goma.”
M23 briefly captured Goma in November, then withdrew to pave the way for peace talks in the Ugandan capital Kampala. The rebellion’s roots lie in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu troops and gangs killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.‘EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT MUST STOP’
Eastern Congo has long been one of Africa’s bloodiest battlefields. M23 emerged early last year when former rebel fighters – who were integrated into the Congolese army under a 2009 peace deal to end a previous revolt – staged a mutiny. The group takes its name from the deal on March 23, 2009, which fighters accused Kinshasa of not honoring when they deserted the army in 2012.
Kobler said that since the M23 rebellion began, the United Nations had sheltered nearly 200 combatants “who consistently and credibly claim to have been recruited on Ugandan but mainly on Rwandan territory.”
“This and other kinds of external involvement must stop,” he said.
The United States, which has called on Rwanda to drop its support for the M23 rebels, stepped up pressure on Kigali this month by moving to block military aid over the recruitment of M23 child soldiers in its territory.
Congolese forces, with the help of a new 3,000-strong U.N. Intervention Brigade that has a mandate to neutralize armed groups, successfully pushed M23 fighters away from Goma – a city of 1 million people – in August. The military defeat forced M23 to return to the Kampala peace talks.
Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Monday there was total disagreement over the amnesty proposed for M23 fighters, while M23 said in a statement that it was waiting for another round of talks to be organized so the remaining points of disagreement could be discussed.
Robinson said that in the draft deal under negotiation, amnesty and integration would be granted to all M23 members except those indicted for suspected war crimes, crimes against humanity, acts of genocide or gross violations of human rights.
M23 combatants would have to make a written commitment to “refrain from acts of rebellion” and their amnesty would be automatically withdrawn if those pledges were violated, said Robinson, a former Irish president.
Reintegration into the Congolese army would be on a case-by-case basis and conditions would include swearing allegiance to the state and constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo and committing to serve in any part of the country, she said.
Robinson told Rwanda’s Kagame that a peace agreement between M23 and Kinshasa “will enable the Force Intervention Brigade to deal with other armed groups in eastern DRC including the FDLR and the ADF.”
Rwanda and M23 have accused the Congolese army of collaborating with the Hutu-led Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an accusation Kinshasa rejects. The ADF is the Islamist group Allied Democratic Forces, which Uganda says is linked to Somalia’s al Shabaab.

Title: Regional MPs to deploy peace observers in the region - 24Tanzania.com
Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Great Lakes region have resolved to deploy peace observers to monitor peace efforts in the region.
MP Onyango Kakoba (Buikwe North)
Addressing a press conference at Parliament, Uganda’s representative on the executive committee of the Forum of Parliaments for the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (FP-ICGLR), Onyango Kakoba (Buikwe North) said the decision was made at the end of a two-day Seventh Ordinary Session in Kigali, Rwanda recently.
“The executive committee plans, within the framework of the parliamentary diplomacy, to deploy observation missions in member states of the ICGLR where both political and security situations constitute a threat against peace and security in the entire Great Lakes Region,” the MP said.
The main concerns raised during the meeting, he said, were the security situation in the eastern DR Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
“Despite the presence of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in DRC (MONUSCO), security remains extremely poor. We’re worried about the insecurity in the DRC because the rest of the region can’t be at peace when this country is in turmoil,” he noted.
Recent fighting between M23 rebels and the Congolese army, allegedly backed by FDLR militia, has seen thousands of refugees cross into Rwanda over the last few days.
The MPs also called on the 12 member states of the ICGLR, the African Union, and the UN to support the government of the Central African Republic in its efforts to restore peace and security, restore the authority of the State on the entire national territory, alleviate the suffering of civilians, and bring an end to violation of human rights.
Violence erupted in CAR in December 2012 when the Séléka rebels launched attacks on the country’s capital before taking power.
On January 11, now-deposed President François Bozizé and representatives of the Seleka rebels signed an agreement in Libreville, Gabon, after three days of negotiations brokered by regional neighbours.
However, the deal collapsed, and Michel Djotodia, leading thousands of Seleka rebels, captured Bangui and proclaimed himself President on March 24, forcing Bozizé into exile.

Ugandan military to tighten border patrol as rebels kill 10 Congolese civilians - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan military has vowed to tighten border patrol after reports that Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels killed 10 civilians in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Richard Karemire, spokesperson of Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), told Xinhua by telephone on Tuesday that the army is on alert in case ADF rebels try to attack Ugandans.
"On the evening of May 19, ADF attacked a place called Mankoko, between Mbau trading center and Mavivi Airport on Beni Oicha road, about 15 km north of Beni Town, killing 10 civilians and injuring two," Karemire said.
The killed were nine men and one woman, while those injured were two women.
"The UPDF will continue to strengthen border patrols along the border with the DRC to protect Ugandans and their property," Karemire said.
"Security forces will also step up coordination and intelligence exchange with DRC counterparts to eliminate ADF from the region," he added.
ADF rebels launched their first attacks in Uganda in 1996. The UPDF managed to flush them out of the country a few years later and drove them into DRC.
Though some rebels have responded to government amnesty and surrendered to authorities in DRC and Uganda, some pockets remain in the forests and they continue attacking villages in the DRC.
About 100 ADF fighters were killed in combined efforts by the UPDF and the DRC army in December.

Uganda starts pre-trial of former ADF rebel leader - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A court in the Ugandan capital Kampala on Monday started a pre-trial of Jamil Mukulu, a former leader of the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) operating in the jungles of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Mukulu and 33 others who appeared before the International Crimes Division of the High Court are facing charges of terrorism and multiple murders.
Solomon Muyita, a senior judiciary communication officer, told Xinhua that the pre-trial session will last at least 30 days.
Mukulu, whose rebel group carried out several attacks in the capital Kampala in the 1990s, is facing charges of terrorism, murder, kidnapping and recruitment of children.
He is also charged over attacks including the 1998 Kichwamba Technical Institute massacre in the western district of Kabarole, in which about 80 students were killed, and charges of murdering top Muslim leaders in the capital, Kampala.
The former rebel leader, who had evaded arrest for the last 20 years, was arrested in Tanzania in March 2015 where he was applying for a travel document for his child. He was extradited to Uganda in June.
The ADF was formed in the 1990s in Uganda, and has been active in eastern DRC in recent years. It has been accused of killing, kidnapping and recruitment of child soldiers in Uganda and DRC.
The group is blamed for the December 2017 killing of at least 15 United Nations peacekeepers and five DRC soldiers. More than 50 others were also injured in the attack in North Kivu province.

Ten civilians were killed overnight in a flashpoint area in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in an attack by suspected Ugandan rebels, an official said on Monday.
The attack was carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia, said Jonas Kibwana, administrator of the Beni region in North Kivu province.
"The ADF attacked the town of Mbau... 10 civilians were shot dead and two others were wounded," Kibwana told AFP, giving a toll confirmed separately by sources in the armed forces and civil society.
Eastern DRC has been wracked by violence since the mid-1990s. The ADF - created by Muslim radicals to oppose the rule of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni - is one of a number of armed groups fighting over the region's rich mineral resources.
It stands accused of killing hundreds of civilians over the years and of carrying out a deadly attack on UN troops in Beni last December that left 15 peacekeepers dead.

Title: Watu kumi wauawa na waasi mashariki mwa DRC – DW – 21.05.2018
Watu wasiopungua 10 wameuawa na washukiwa wa kundi la waasi wa Uganda ADF mashariki mwa Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasi ya Congo, katika mauaji ya karibuni zaidi kwenye eneo hilo tete. Makaazi ya watu na biashara pia vimeharibiwa
Afisa wa serikali ya jimbo Donat Kibwana, ameliambia shirika la habari la Ujerumani dpa, kuwa waasi wanaoaminika kutoka kundi la ADF walishambulia kijiji cha Manggboko katika mkoa wa Beni Jumapili usiku, na kuuwa watu 10 wakiwemo wasichana wawili.
Mwandishi wa DW katika mkoa wa Beni John Janyunyu ametembelea familia moja iliyopmpoteza baba mzazi ambapo ameelezea huzunu kutawala katika familia hiyo.
"Na unapoingia Mbau, utaona nyuso za watu zikiwa zimekunjana kufuatia mauaji hayo ya jana jioni katika kata ya Mangboko," ameripoti Kanyunyu.
Jeshi lakwepa wajibu wake
Philippe Paluku Bonane, kiongozi wa kiraia, aliiambia dpa kuwa jeshi halikuingilia kati mauaji hayo hadi waasi walipoondoka kijijini hapo. Mashirika ya kiraia katika wilaya ya Beni, yametangaza siku mbili za maombolezo kuanzia Jumatatu.
Aidha mashirika ya kiraia yametoa mwito kwa serikali kufanya juu chini ili kuhakikisha kuwa mauaji na mashambulizi yanayofanywa na waasi wa ADF kutoka Uganda yanakomeshwa.
Makundi mbalimbali ya waasi yanaendesha shughuli zake mashariki mwa Congo, yakipigania hasa udhibiti wa rasilimali za eneo hilo.
Kulingana na Umoja wa Mataifa, kundi la ADF liliundwa mwaka 1995 na wanakutikana kwenye eneo la milima mpakani mwa DRC na Uganda. Kundi hilo linafahamika kwa kutumia wanajeshi watoto.
Kundi hilo limeuawa takribani watu 2000 katika mji na Wilaya ya Beni katika kipindi cha miaka minne, ameripoti mwandishi wa DW John Kanyunyu.

Title: 10 militia killed in DRC: army | News24
Thursday, 29 August
24 May 2018
Ten suspected Ugandan militia members have been killed in an army offensive on a rebel base in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the DRC military said on Thursday.
The early morning operation in the Beni region of North Kivu province targeted the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militia created by Muslim radicals to oppose Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni which also operates in the DRC.
General Marcel Mbangu, operations commander against Ugandan rebels in North Kivu, told AFP that at midday "provisional estimates" showed 10 ADF members had been killed.
Witnesses described hearing explosions from heavy and light weapons.
"This news gives hope - the army has gone on the offensive, even if there are still doubts about the enemy's identity," said Noella Muluwavyo, a civil society leader in the territory of Beni.
The operation follows another flareup of violence in eastern DRC where a number of armed groups fight over the region's rich mineral resources.
On Monday, officials said 10 civilians were shot dead in the regional town of Mbau by ADF militia, some 500 metres (yards) from army position.
The group stands accused of killing hundreds of civilians over the years and of carrying out a deadly attack on UN troops in Beni last December that left 15 peacekeepers dead.

	Mueren diez civiles en un ataque ejecutado por presuntos miembros de las ADF en el noreste de RDC

MADRID, 21 May. (EUROPA PRESS) -
Al menos diez personas murieron el domingo un ataque ejecutado por presuntos miembros del grupo armado Fuerzas Democráticas Aliadas (ADF) en los alrededores de Beni, ubicada en el noreste de República Democrática del Congo (RDC).
Según fuentes locales citadas por la emisora Radio Okapi, el ataque fue ejecutado en la localidad de Mangboko, tras el cual los milicianos saquearon varios comercios.
El secretario de la sociedad civil en el territorio de Beni, Janvier Kasayiryo, ha indicado que las ADF "saquearon dos tiendas y atacaron una farmacia, de donde robaron todos los medicamentos".
Asimismo, ha resaltado que el Ejército intervino para repeler el ataque, desencadenando unos enfrentamientos que se extendieron durante cerca de tres horas.
Kasayiryo ha afirmado además que la Misión de Naciones Unidas en República Democrática del Congo (MONUSCO) envió una patrulla para reforzar el despliegue del Ejército, si bien la misión no se ha pronunciado por el momento.
Las autoridades locales han declarado dos días de luto en memoria de los civiles muertos en este ataque.
La milicia actúa en RDC desde la década de los noventa y, a pesar de las reiteradas ofensivas lanzadas contra ella, sigue generando violencia en la zona. Está considerado uno de los grupos armados más peligrosos de las varias decenas que operan en el país africano.

Title: Congo’s Kabila wants to conclude talks with rebels - 24Tanzania.com
Congo’s president wants talks with rebels in the country’s east concluded as soon as possible, Ugandan and Congolese statements said, although there was no sign of a breakthrough on the wording of an accord that scuppered a signing last month.DRC president Joseph KabilaKinshasa and Congo’s M23 rebels failed to seal the deal after squabbles over what it should be called – the insurgents were ready to sign a peace agreement but Congo wanted to call it a declaration that reflected the rebels’ military defeat.M23 are the latest incarnation of Tutsi-led insurgents who have battled Congo’s government in eastern regions for more than two decades.The cycle of conflict fuelled by competition over land and mineral wealth has undermined the stability of the surrounding region and Congo had regularly accused its eastern neighbors Rwanda and Uganda of backing the insurgents – a charge they both deny.After the November 11 signing ceremony in Uganda fell through, the Democratic Republic of Congo said Uganda, which was mediating the talks, had favored the rebels.Congolese President Joseph Kabila and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni met on Monday in Uganda’s capital to discuss the deal.“The two presidents agreed that the Kampala dialogue between the government of the DRC and M23 should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible,” the Congolese statement said.

DRC president Joseph Kabila
Kinshasa and Congo’s M23 rebels failed to seal the deal after squabbles over what it should be called – the insurgents were ready to sign a peace agreement but Congo wanted to call it a declaration that reflected the rebels’ military defeat.
M23 are the latest incarnation of Tutsi-led insurgents who have battled Congo’s government in eastern regions for more than two decades.
The cycle of conflict fuelled by competition over land and mineral wealth has undermined the stability of the surrounding region and Congo had regularly accused its eastern neighbors Rwanda and Uganda of backing the insurgents – a charge they both deny.
After the November 11 signing ceremony in Uganda fell through, the Democratic Republic of Congo said Uganda, which was mediating the talks, had favored the rebels.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni met on Monday in Uganda’s capital to discuss the deal.
“The two presidents agreed that the Kampala dialogue between the government of the DRC and M23 should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible,” the Congolese statement said. The Ugandan announcement repeated the message, with minor variations in the text.
They did not say what a final deal should look like.
The statements also said a swift conclusion to the talks would “facilitate the peaceful return of M23 ex-combatants and the completion of the process of demobilization. This would further create appropriate conditions for the return of Congolese refugees living in neighboring countries.”
When the signing fell apart, Uganda said wrangling was over the title of the document rather than its content, which addressed issues such as offering an amnesty for those involved in the act of rebellion but not for war crimes.
It tackled the reintegration of rebels into the army as well as some of the root causes of the unrest, including issues surrounding the return of Tutsi refugees to Congo.
Congo’s failure to sign raised questions over its willingness to reach a political deal with a rebel force it has defeated militarily, analysts said.

Title: Ugandan leader of shadowy rebel group in court over mass murder charges | News24
Thursday, 29 August
15 May 2018
The Ugandan leader of a shadowy rebel group operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo appeared in court Monday on charges of mass murder and crimes against humanity.
Jamil Mukulu, leader of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), has been in detention since he was arrested in Tanzania in April 2015 and extradited to Uganda later that year.
The ADF is a Ugandan Muslim rebel group whose basic motives and ideology remain unclear but regional governments have alleged links to international jihadist movements.
The start of the pre-trial hearing marks the first time Mukulu has appeared in court since he was charged in July 2015.
In the court precinct Mukulu protested his innocence and blamed the Ugandan government for a series of murders of prominent Muslims that authorities have pinned on the ADF.
"I'm not a murderer. They want to kill us," Mukulu shouted to journalists.
He appeared alongside 34 handcuffed and shackled co-accused who all alleged via their lawyers that they had been tortured while in detention.

The hearing marks the start of a convoluted judicial process at the Ugandan High Court's International Crimes Division - which was specially set up a decade ago to try crimes allegedly committed by the Lord's Resistance Army, another rebel group.
The ADF started out in 1989 with the aim of overthrowing Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, who was seen as hostile to Muslims. It absorbed other rebel factions in its ranks and started carrying out attacks in 1995.
Forced westwards by the Ugandan army, the group relocated most of its activities to the DRC, finding a lucrative niche in its lawless, resource-rich east.
Its rollcall of crimes includes mass killings and maiming using machetes, the use of child soldiers and rape, according to the UN.
While regional governments and the UN have blamed the ADF for a number of attacks on civilian and military targets, independent researchers say the group is often used as a cover by armed actors with an ulterior motive, including Congolese soldiers.
Kristof Titeca, an academic at the University of Antwerp who specialises in the ADF, is one of several who argue that the group is not responsible for all the violence blamed on them.
"The violence and attacks attributed to the ADF in the DRC have always been part of a very murky situation, in which a variety of armed actors attribute and cover up their actions as 'ADF' actions," he told AFP.

BENI, DR Congo: Ten civilians were killed overnight in a flashpoint area in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in an attack by suspected Ugandan rebels, an official said on Monday.The attack was carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia, said Jonas Kibwana, administrator of the Beni region in North Kivu province.

Title: New Force Intervention Brigade boss is South African - defenceWeb
Newly minted South African brigadier general Patrick Dube has taken over command of the tri nation Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The FIB was created by the UN and is the first ever force to be deployed as blue helmets with an offensive mandate in its efforts to keep the population safe from rebel groupings operating in the country.
Dube took up position in the mission area in the third week of April and the first official confirmation of his deployment came in Parliament last week during the Defence Budget Vote.
He was previously in the DRC as second-in-command of the FIB in 2013/14 when the UN mandated force supported the DRC military – FARDC – to defeat the M23 rebel group utilising the Rooivalk combat support helicopter.
Fifty-two-year-old Dube is a former Umkhonto we Sizwe operative who joined the then newly established SA National Defence Force (SANDF) following integration in 1994.
He received his MK military training in Angola, Tanzania and various eastern bloc countries including the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Dube was a former liberation movement armed wing member who integrated to form the SANDF. He entered the new force as a lieutenant.
An infantry officer through and through, Dube was a young officer in an operational unit – 2 SA Infantry Battalion – which exposed him as a platoon commander on his first deployment in Lesotho in 1998/99 during Operation Boleas. He also served as a company commander in internal operations, as a battalion second-in-command in 2003 in the DRC and battalion logistics officer in 2004.
Dube was appointed as the Officer Commanding 21 SA Infantry Battalion in 2006. During two years in charge he presided over unit relocation to new premises in Doornkop, south of Johannesburg. He also took charge of preparation and employment of his unit for a number of successful internal operations.

Title: Electric vehicle market exposed to risk from violence - UPI.com
May 31 (UPI) --The global electric vehicle market is expanding, but the supporting metals and refining markets are exposed to risk, an IEA report found.A report from the International Energy Agency onthe global outlookfor electric vehicles found sales passed 1 million last year, a record level and a 54 percent increase over 2016. Norway has the largest concentration, with EV sales accounting for 39 percent of new vehicle sales. Whileelectric carsmake up only 2.2 percent of the Chinese market, the volume means the country leads in terms of global sales.Advertisement"So far, EV deployment has mostly been driven by policy," the IEA's report read. "The main markets by volume - China -- and sales share - Norway -- have the strongest policy push."Ten countries, which combine to represent more than 60 percent of the global EV market, last year endorsed a push to reach a 30 percent market share for electric vehicles by 2030. In order to make further advances, the IEA said battery chemistry needs to evolve because of supply issues with elements like nickel, lithium and cobalt, which provide the backbone for the batteries used in electric vehicles.Advertisement"The supply of cobalt is particularly subject to risks as almost 60 percent of the global production of cobalt is currently concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo," the report read.The U.N.

May 31 (UPI) --The global electric vehicle market is expanding, but the supporting metals and refining markets are exposed to risk, an IEA report found.
A report from the International Energy Agency onthe global outlookfor electric vehicles found sales passed 1 million last year, a record level and a 54 percent increase over 2016. Norway has the largest concentration, with EV sales accounting for 39 percent of new vehicle sales. Whileelectric carsmake up only 2.2 percent of the Chinese market, the volume means the country leads in terms of global sales.Advertisement
"So far, EV deployment has mostly been driven by policy," the IEA's report read. "The main markets by volume - China -- and sales share - Norway -- have the strongest policy push."
Ten countries, which combine to represent more than 60 percent of the global EV market, last year endorsed a push to reach a 30 percent market share for electric vehicles by 2030. In order to make further advances, the IEA said battery chemistry needs to evolve because of supply issues with elements like nickel, lithium and cobalt, which provide the backbone for the batteries used in electric vehicles.Advertisement
"The supply of cobalt is particularly subject to risks as almost 60 percent of the global production of cobalt is currently concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo," the report read.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugeesin Marchsaid refugees fleeing DRC to neighboring Uganda were relaying stories of "horrific inter-ethnic violence and sexual abuse." More than 75 percent of those displaced by violence in the DRC are women and children who are providing accounts of widespread rape and murder.
Regional conflict in part stemmed foran uprisingby M23 rebels in DRC, former soldiers who accuse the government on reneging on a 2009 peace agreement. More recently, DRC has been plagued by an outbreak of Ebola.
Outside of the region, cobalt refining and processing is limited almost exclusively to China.
"Even accounting for ongoing developments in battery chemistry, cobalt demand for EVs is expected to be between 10 and 25 times higher than current levels by 2030," the IEA's report read.
Lithium-ion batteries used in newer vehicles are approaching the performance level of internal combustion engines.

Title: Two UN peacekeepers missing in DRC | News24
Thursday, 29 August
15 May 2018
Two United Nations peacekeepers in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are listed as missing after their convoy came under attack in the country's restless southeast, the UN mission said on Tuesday.
"A peacekeeping convoy was attacked by mai-mai on Friday in Tanganyika (Province)," Florence Marchal, MONUSCO's spokesperson, told AFP, referring to one of the many so-called self-defence groups operating in southeastern DRC.
"Two troops in the Benin contingent have since been listed as missing. The whole mission is mobilised to find them."
Eleven other troops who were in the two-vehicle convoy are safe, Marchal said.
On December 15, 15 Tanzanian members of MONUSCO were killed in the northeastern region of Beni when their position was attacked by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel militia.
MONUSCO is the UN's biggest peacekeeping force, with its deployment dating to 1999. Today, it comprises more than 16 000 troops, 660 military observers and more than 1 450 police.
DRC's government wants the force to leave the country in 2020.
