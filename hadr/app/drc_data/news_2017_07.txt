Title: Kampala to host crisis summit over DR Congo - 24Tanzania.com
An emergency regional Heads of State and Government summit on the latest flare up of hostilities in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is scheduled on Thursday in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
Sam Kutesa, Uganda’s Foreign Affairs minister
The summit was called by the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in his capacity as the Chairman of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), a grouping of 12 countries.
Both the ICGLR Secretariat in Bujumbura and Uganda’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed the extraordinary meeting, which will be preceded by the joint meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence due tomorrow.
The extraordinary summit, the seventh such gathering of IGCLR leaders in a space of just over a year, is expected to provide a “lasting solution” to the ongoing conflict, which last month threatened to spill over to Rwanda, after 36 mortar bombs landed into the border district of Rubavu.
In one of the bombs, which Kigali blamed on the Congolese army (FARDC) and FDLR, a militia largely responsible for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, killed a woman and seriously injured her two-month baby when it landed in Mugangari market in Rubavu town last Thursday.
Rwanda responded by warning that the continued violation of its territorial integrity by the Congolese forces and the genocidal militia, which is said to be co-located with FARDC in several parts of eastern DRC, was no longer tolerable.
“The persistent shelling of Rwandan territory is unacceptable, as it would be to any sovereign nation. Rwandan civilians are being targeted by DRC forces. We have remained restrained for as long as we can but this provocation can no longer be tolerated,” Foreign Affairs minister Louise Mushikiwabo said in a statement.
The Rwanda Defence Forces then moved heavy arsenal and amassed troops in Rubavu, sparking fears for a possible all-out war between Rwanda and DRC.
Congo’s M23 rebels have over the last one week engaged in a fierce battle against the FARDC and the UN peacekeepers in the Congo, particularly a newly deployed offensive brigade, known as the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB).
In Kampala, Foreign affairs minister Sam Kutesa said in a statement on Saturday that the upcoming summit was “very urgent” given the “deteriorating situation” in eastern DRC in recent days.
“This coming extra-ordinary summit should be seen as an effort by the Chair to bring all parties to the conflict and all regional leaders to help find a lasting solution to the conflict, aimed at creating stability in eastern DRC and the region as whole,” Minister Kutesa said in the statement.
The summit is also expected to be attended by the UN Special Representative to the Great Lakes Region, former Ireland president, Mary Robinson, who last week urged calm and reiterated the need for a political settlement of the crisis.
Robinson was yesterday in Kinshasa as part of a regional tour aimed at defusing tension.
Barrel of the gun
According to Aloys Mahwa, the Executive Director of the Interdisciplinary Genocide Studies Centre, based in Kigali, the upcoming ICGLR summit is a litmus test for regional leaders and the western players with regard to their commitment to resolve the Congo issue once and for all.
He said the M23 grievances can only be resolved politically and not through the barrel of the gun.
“The people of this region are tired of wars. An escalation in the conflict in eastern DRC has great potential to roll back the impressive economic gains and stability the peoples of this region have enjoyed in the recent years,” he told The New Times.
Talks between the Kinshasa government and M23 rebels which had been ongoing in Kampala have stalled for months, with the rebels accusing the government of acting contrary to its pledge during an ICGLR Heads of State summit that it would address the rebels’ grievances once the latter withdrew from Goma last November.
Previous rebel gains on the battlefield have fuelled accusations that they have the support of Rwanda, allegations Kigali has strenuously denied.
Instead, the Rwandan government has accused Congo of working closely with and in some cases embedding the FDLR fighters in FARDC units deployed close to the Rwandan border.
M23 was created by mutinous Congolese soldiers, who broke ranks with the regular army in April 2012 accusing the government of President Joseph Kabila of breaching the terms of a March 2009 peace accord that had ended a previous rebellion.
US diplomat visits
In a related development, the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Rwanda during which she discussed with Rwandan officials to deteriorating security situation in eastern DRC, according to a statement from the US embassy in Kigali.
Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that the Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework (for DRC and the region) and provides the best chance in decades to bring stability to the Great Lakes region through a comprehensive political and development process supported by the UN and the World Bank, the statement said in part.
Thomas-Greenfield urged the Framework signatories to “engage directly in a political process to diplomatically de-escalate the situation and address the underlying causes of conflict in the region and their legitimate security concerns”.
Rwanda is a signatory to the peace framework signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by 11 regional countries, with the UN, African Union, ICGLR and SADC signing as guarantors.The US diplomat was expected to proceed to Kinshasa.
Thomas-Greenfield’s visit came before a visit scheduled for later this week by the United States’ newly-named Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Russell Feingold, the statement said.
Representatives of the European Union and African Union are visiting the region over the Congo crisis.

Title: Open Letter to the UN Secretary-General on Peacekeeping in DRC - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
While the presence of the UN peace operation MONUSCO in the DRC is crucial, it needs to adapt to the deepening crisis as violence escalates in parts of the country, and recognise President Kabila’s role in the country’s instability. The UN should use its forthcoming strategic review to adjust the mission to these challenges.
Your Excellency,
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is facing its deepest crisis since the end of the 1998-2003 war. Prospects for a peaceful transfer of power, on which the country’s stability depends, look increasingly remote, as President Joseph Kabila appears to be moving ever further from elections. Several areas of the country, most notably the Kasai, are descending into violence and the potential remains high for clashes in major cities and towns. The presence of the UN peace operation, MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo), is critical. But it needs to adapt to meet these new challenges. This means moving from joint military operations with the government and stabilisation activities in eastern DRC toward a role more focused on deterring and documenting violence country-wide and stimulating greater consensus among regional and major powers on efforts to end the crisis. The UN’s forthcoming strategic review offers an opportunity to reorient the mission accordingly, all the more important in view of further mandate discussions early next year.
Last December, a deal between President Kabila and main political opposition groups provided for an election delay of a year and offered some hope that the DRC might find a way out of its latest political crisis. Since then, however, implementation of the agreement has faltered. Successive rounds of talks before and after the signing of the deal, which saw President Kabila repeatedly attempt to split and co-opt his opponents, also contributed to the fragmentation of the political class and further divided and weakened the opposition.
Electoral delays also mean that the president, provincial governors and national and provincial legislatures have outstayed their mandates, further eroding their authority. Numerous political actors and armed groups are now more openly challenging the state, provoking an increasingly violent response from the government. This trend has been documented by the UN’s human rights office, whose data shows over the past months and years a dramatic uptick in violent incidents perpetrated by security forces. The government’s use of the Congolese justice system against rivals has undermined any confidence it enjoyed and its role as a credible umpire. Repeated prison breaks over recent months, massive in scale, further contribute to the image of a state on the verge of collapse.
Popular anger at both government and political elites in general is widespread. It has found expression in several riots since January 2015, all repressed by security forces. A deepening social and economic crisis, affecting a population already suffering from endemic poverty, further aggravates unrest. But with civil society crushed by government crackdowns and the opposition in disarray, discontent is disorganised, without clear leadership or representation.
Local conflicts and inter-communal bloodshed are also on the rise. These include the violence in the Kasai, where reports have emerged of the Congolese government backing armed groups and aUN Human Rights Council resolution expressed concernover reports of
a wave of violence, serious and gross human rights violations and abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law...perpetrated by all, including those involving recruitment and use of child soldiers, sexual and gender-based violence, destruction of houses, schools, places of worship, and State infrastructure by local militias, as well as of mass graves.
Armed group activity in the Kivus and Ituri has also flared up. These conflicts affect not only local and national dynamics. Through refugee flows, the presence of foreign militias and trans-border community ties, they also risk renewed regional intervention.
The current forum for regional and international engagement in the DRC is the Peace Security and Cooperation Framework (PSCF). Established in 2013, it was the result mostly of mobilisation within the South African Development Community (SADC), supported by Western powers, to fight the M23, an armed group plaguing parts of eastern DRC, and halt the associated meddling from the M23’s main sponsor, Rwanda. The new political framework was accompanied by a military component, the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), integrated into MONUSCO’s command but with SADC members providing the troops, and with a more assertive posture against armed groups in the east.
The PSCF has since ossified, however, and been overtaken by the now national-level crisis. After fighting the M23, the FIB has shown none of the same determination against other armed groups. Even the limited consensus between Western and SADC powers has collapsed. The DRC’s relations with its main donors have frosted over, with Western powers, in particular the EU and the U.S., attempting to increase pressure on Kinshasa, notably through sanctions on individuals seen as responsible for violent repression of protests and the clashes in the Kasai. [The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also has been critical]9http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21797&LangID=E), calling for an international investigation of alleged government support for Kasai militias. Kinshasa’s diplomacy on the continent has, however, won it public support from some African leaders. This backing is far from unanimous: some African leaders, including within SADC and the Great Lakes region, recognise that the president’s determination to stay in power lies at the core of the crisis and are more critical behind closed doors. But generally supportive public statements diminish pressure on President Kabila to compromise.
The forthcoming UN strategic assessment, with a UN Secretariat team traveling to the DRC this week and reporting back to the Council in September, presents an opportunity for new thinking on the mission’s role. The overarching challenge – given that President Kabila’s government is now, in effect, the principle source of the country’s instability – will be to redefine the mission’s relationship with Kinshasa. After a decade supporting state institutions, striking the right balance between distancing itself from the government while still maintaining sufficiently good relations to operate in the country will be a tough balancing act. Certainly, it is not one the mission can perform without the active support of, and a reasonable degree of coherence among, international and regional diplomats in the DRC.
For now, the threat of drastic reductions in MONUSCO appears off the cards. The new U.S. administration, which had suggested that it would seek deep cuts in line with its lobbying for reductions across UN peace operations signed off, in June, on a mission budget only slightly smaller than that proposed by the Secretariat. This is fortunate, given the detrimental impact such a signal of UN disengagement would have on the calculations of communities and leaders across the DRC.
But the Secretariat and other Security Council members would be remiss to see this as a vote for the status quo and to back away from serious reform. The U.S. is certain to push again for greater cuts, whether this year or next. It would be better to base reform on a strategic reorientation now rather than on budget pressure later. Plus, more importantly, the mission needs to adapt if it is to remain effective. The priorities should include:
Beefing up the mission's deployment across the country of integrated, mobile teams comprising political affairs officers, human rights officials, military observers and members of the Joint Mission Analysis Centre (JMAC), ensuring a regular presence of such teams in all of the country’s 26 provinces. Such teams can deter, as best as possible, and document violence and human rights violations, including cases of sexual and gender-based violence, through engagement and good offices with local officials, civil society and local actors. They could also act as an early warning mechanism.
Reversing the mission’s concentration in the Eastern provinces. The situation today requires the UN to effectively cover other parts of the country and adjust its approach to protection based on varying levels of violence in different areas. A lighter but more agile military footprint, that would mean protecting civilians by projection more than presence, would allow the mission to address increased militia violence in areas like the Kasai, while retaining a presence in the east to focus on threats of a more strategic nature and deter regional conflagration. Such an approach would require increased mobility, flexibility and logistics capacity. European troop contributors could offer surge logistics support to assist this move.
Integrating the Force Intervention Brigade more fully into MONUSCO. The FIB serves an important function by ensuring some regional involvement occurs under UN auspices. It also deters neighbours’ meddling. But ideally, its operations – namely protection of civilians and a coercive approach toward militias – would fit within MONUSCO, without the need for a separate structure. In this context, the secretariat should consider abolishing the FIB and integrating its forces within the UN mission, ensuring that all force components fulfil their robust mandate. Such a move would provide the mission's leadership with increased flexibility. If this is not feasible, then at a minimum the mission and FIB troop contributors should better allow the FIB to operate outside the east in kinetic operations against armed groups together with other MONUSCO units as required.
Reviewing the mission's military cooperation with the government. Large-scale, joint operations with DRC forces against armed groups, long inappropriate, are now not even defensible. Such offensives only make sense as part of a comprehensive stabilisation strategy, and such a strategy cannot be developed in partnership with a government whose objectives now contrast dramatically to those of the UN.
Reviewing MONUSCO’s long-term stabilisation and developmental activities, and dropping security sector reform altogether. While much good has been done in these areas, political actors at the provincial and national levels now tend to enjoy insufficient public trust to serve as effective partners.
Investing in effective communication between the mission and humanitarian actors, given the critical role they will play as the crisis deepens. This would include better relaying plans for troop presence and posture in conflict-affected areas in which humanitarians operate. Such communication will help further the common goal of civilian protection.
Ensuring the mission’s leadership continues to look for opportunities to nudge forward the transition in Kinshasa, while recognising that its influence over President Kabila is limited. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, together with the Great Lakes envoy, should also push regional and major powers toward more convergence on their engagement in the DRC, building on the PSCF. While it may not overcome divergent positions toward President Kabila on the continent and further afield, it might stimulate new opportunities for diplomacy, moving away from a sterile debate on sanctions. The strategic review might also offer an opportunity for a frank conversation with FIB troop contributors on their response to the crisis, as effective UN diplomacy requires greater regional support.
The peaceful transfer of power that the DRC needs to escape its current crisis appears ever more remote, given President Kabila’s determination to remain in office, the incoherence of regional and major actors and, therefore, their lack of leverage. But the challenge is not limited to the stalled transition. The whole country faces security threats reminiscent of the 1990s, territorial administration is in chaos, social services are collapsing and state institutions violently contested. The crisis today is national and arguably poses a graver threat to both the country and region than that provoked by the M23 that motivated the PCSF in the first place. Yet regional and international engagement appears to be fading as the danger grows. While MONUSCO alone cannot resolve the DRC’s crisis, it can play a critical role in deterring violence, preventing the worse ravages of the crisis and corralling regional and major powers toward renewed engagement and consensus. The strategic review is an opportunity to shift its mandate in this direction.

The Framework was signed in Addis Ababa in February this year.
Mushikiwabo made the remarks ahead of the UN Security Council Debate on ‘Supporting the Great Lakes Framework’ scheduled for Thursday, July 25 in New York.
She is expected to take part in the debate, to be chaired by US Secretary of State John Kerry, where she will discuss what Rwanda has done towards the implementation of the framework.
The debate will focus on building on several events that have brought renewed efforts to establishing lasting peace that tackles the underlying causes of conflict in the region.
“We have made progress toward the Framework but what we need to see is the situation on the ground changing beyond the frameworks and the documents,” Mushikiwabo told The New Times in an interview on Friday.
“Different countries have done what they are supposed to do.”
The Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the Region was signed on February 24 by Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo, DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.
The accord aims at a complete restoration of peace in the region mainly in the eastern DRC.
It also seeks to end instabilities by use of a holistic approach that addresses the multifaceted root causes of the conflicts in the region.
Although efforts are being invested in realising the objectives of the Framework, concerns remain about warring parties’ commitments in supporting the process.
Rwanda optimistic
“As part of implementing the framework, Rwanda received refugees and disarmed them, collaborated with the US in sending Bosco Ntaganda to the International Criminal Court (ICC), participated in the technical committee meetings establishing the evaluation mechanism of the framework and many more,” Mushikiwabo said, adding that; “However, we would want to see progress happening on the ground but we are very optimistic.

Although efforts are underway to ensure stability mainly in the DRC, violence continues to escalate.
The latest surge in violence culminated recently with a fight between the DRC government forces and the M23 rebel group.  In March, about 700 rebel fighters led by ex-political leader Jean-Marie Runiga fled into Rwanda following the fierce fighting between two DR Congo rebel factions of M23.
The recent violence has resulted into the United Nations and the UN Mission in DRC (MONUSCO) reconsidering their relations with President Joseph Kabila’s government following the army’s desecrating of corpses belonging to rebel fighters.

Title: DRC: Release our colleagues abducted by ADF four years ago - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
On 11 July 2013, four members of a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team conducting an exploratory mission to assess medical needs in Kamango in North Kivu province inDemocratic Republic of Congo(DRC) were abducted during an attack on the village by the armed group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
The ADF continues to fuel a climate of terror in this region wedged between the Rwenzori Mountains and the dense forests of Virunga National Park where abduction is commonplace. Like the MSF team, hundreds of people, most of them Congolese but also Ugandans, Burundians and Tanzanians, have disappeared, giving the conflict a regional dimension.
The day following the abduction, MSF set up a special unit to find our colleagues. On 29 August 2014, taking advantage of military operations launched by the Congolese army against the ADF, one of the MSF team taken hostage in Kamango - Chantal Kaghoma - managed to flee after over 13 months of detention. Very sadly, while many other hostages escaped their jailers during the same period, we are still without news of Philippe Bundya Musongelwa, Richard Muhindo Matabishi and Romy Ya-Dunia Ntibanyendera.
Despite our efforts, and the escalation in violence in DRC and more particularly in North Kivu, MSF has still not ascertained the whereabouts of our three colleagues. We continue our investigations, not only in DRC but also across its borders, and to support the families of our three missing colleagues.
That ADF - as well as other armed groups in the region - continue to exist after so many years cannot be explained solely by geographic remoteness or the group’s modus operandi. It could neither subsist nor operate without intermediaries and outside support. MSF continues its inquiries but, without the help of local as well as regional social, economic and political stakeholders, the fate of our colleagues and hundreds of other people remains uncertain. We call on decision-makers and those with influence in both DRC and across the region to commit to obtaining the hostages’ release and bring this matter to a swift and positive conclusion.

Title: Kagame calls for end to genocide militia group - 24Tanzania.com

His remarks followed a discussion and presentation of various reports, including the report by the Peace and Security Council.
“Despite the welcome agreement signed between the government of DRC and M23, an armed group behind the 1994 Genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, the FDLR, remains untackled, even though it is the bedrock of instability in our region.

Title: Kampala to host crisis summit over DR Congo - 24Tanzania.com
An emergency regional Heads of State and Government summit on the latest flare up of hostilities in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is scheduled on Thursday in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
Sam Kutesa, Uganda’s Foreign Affairs minister
The summit was called by the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in his capacity as the Chairman of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), a grouping of 12 countries.
Both the ICGLR Secretariat in Bujumbura and Uganda’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed the extraordinary meeting, which will be preceded by the joint meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence due tomorrow.
The extraordinary summit, the seventh such gathering of IGCLR leaders in a space of just over a year, is expected to provide a “lasting solution” to the ongoing conflict, which last month threatened to spill over to Rwanda, after 36 mortar bombs landed into the border district of Rubavu.
In one of the bombs, which Kigali blamed on the Congolese army (FARDC) and FDLR, a militia largely responsible for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, killed a woman and seriously injured her two-month baby when it landed in Mugangari market in Rubavu town last Thursday.
Rwanda responded by warning that the continued violation of its territorial integrity by the Congolese forces and the genocidal militia, which is said to be co-located with FARDC in several parts of eastern DRC, was no longer tolerable.
“The persistent shelling of Rwandan territory is unacceptable, as it would be to any sovereign nation. Rwandan civilians are being targeted by DRC forces. We have remained restrained for as long as we can but this provocation can no longer be tolerated,” Foreign Affairs minister Louise Mushikiwabo said in a statement.
The Rwanda Defence Forces then moved heavy arsenal and amassed troops in Rubavu, sparking fears for a possible all-out war between Rwanda and DRC.
Congo’s M23 rebels have over the last one week engaged in a fierce battle against the FARDC and the UN peacekeepers in the Congo, particularly a newly deployed offensive brigade, known as the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB).
In Kampala, Foreign affairs minister Sam Kutesa said in a statement on Saturday that the upcoming summit was “very urgent” given the “deteriorating situation” in eastern DRC in recent days.
“This coming extra-ordinary summit should be seen as an effort by the Chair to bring all parties to the conflict and all regional leaders to help find a lasting solution to the conflict, aimed at creating stability in eastern DRC and the region as whole,” Minister Kutesa said in the statement.
The summit is also expected to be attended by the UN Special Representative to the Great Lakes Region, former Ireland president, Mary Robinson, who last week urged calm and reiterated the need for a political settlement of the crisis.
Robinson was yesterday in Kinshasa as part of a regional tour aimed at defusing tension.
Barrel of the gun
According to Aloys Mahwa, the Executive Director of the Interdisciplinary Genocide Studies Centre, based in Kigali, the upcoming ICGLR summit is a litmus test for regional leaders and the western players with regard to their commitment to resolve the Congo issue once and for all.
He said the M23 grievances can only be resolved politically and not through the barrel of the gun.
“The people of this region are tired of wars. An escalation in the conflict in eastern DRC has great potential to roll back the impressive economic gains and stability the peoples of this region have enjoyed in the recent years,” he told The New Times.
Talks between the Kinshasa government and M23 rebels which had been ongoing in Kampala have stalled for months, with the rebels accusing the government of acting contrary to its pledge during an ICGLR Heads of State summit that it would address the rebels’ grievances once the latter withdrew from Goma last November.
Previous rebel gains on the battlefield have fuelled accusations that they have the support of Rwanda, allegations Kigali has strenuously denied.
Instead, the Rwandan government has accused Congo of working closely with and in some cases embedding the FDLR fighters in FARDC units deployed close to the Rwandan border.
M23 was created by mutinous Congolese soldiers, who broke ranks with the regular army in April 2012 accusing the government of President Joseph Kabila of breaching the terms of a March 2009 peace accord that had ended a previous rebellion.
US diplomat visits
In a related development, the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Rwanda during which she discussed with Rwandan officials to deteriorating security situation in eastern DRC, according to a statement from the US embassy in Kigali.
Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield reiterated that the Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework (for DRC and the region) and provides the best chance in decades to bring stability to the Great Lakes region through a comprehensive political and development process supported by the UN and the World Bank, the statement said in part.
Thomas-Greenfield urged the Framework signatories to “engage directly in a political process to diplomatically de-escalate the situation and address the underlying causes of conflict in the region and their legitimate security concerns”.
Rwanda is a signatory to the peace framework signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by 11 regional countries, with the UN, African Union, ICGLR and SADC signing as guarantors.The US diplomat was expected to proceed to Kinshasa.
Thomas-Greenfield’s visit came before a visit scheduled for later this week by the United States’ newly-named Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Russell Feingold, the statement said.
Representatives of the European Union and African Union are visiting the region over the Congo crisis.

Rwanda’s Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo
The Framework was signed in Addis Ababa in February this year.
Mushikiwabo made the remarks ahead of the UN Security Council Debate on ‘Supporting the Great Lakes Framework’ scheduled for Thursday, July 25 in New York.
She is expected to take part in the debate, to be chaired by US Secretary of State John Kerry, where she will discuss what Rwanda has done towards the implementation of the framework.
The debate will focus on building on several events that have brought renewed efforts to establishing lasting peace that tackles the underlying causes of conflict in the region.
“We have made progress toward the Framework but what we need to see is the situation on the ground changing beyond the frameworks and the documents,” Mushikiwabo told The New Times in an interview on Friday.
“Different countries have done what they are supposed to do.”
The Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the Region was signed on February 24 by Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo, DRC, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.
The accord aims at a complete restoration of peace in the region mainly in the eastern DRC.
It also seeks to end instabilities by use of a holistic approach that addresses the multifaceted root causes of the conflicts in the region.
Although efforts are being invested in realising the objectives of the Framework, concerns remain about warring parties’ commitments in supporting the process.
Rwanda optimistic
“As part of implementing the framework, Rwanda received refugees and disarmed them, collaborated with the US in sending Bosco Ntaganda to the International Criminal Court (ICC), participated in the technical committee meetings establishing the evaluation mechanism of the framework and many more,” Mushikiwabo said, adding that; “However, we would want to see progress happening on the ground but we are very optimistic. The UN Secretary General Special Envoy to the Great Lakes, Mary Robinson is doing a great job. She’s a good broker for the region.”
During the ministerial debate, participants are expected to address key challenges to the implementation of the framework and recommendations for addressing them, including ensuring civilian protection and human rights and steps to deal with any actors that impede these objectives.
According to Minister Mushikiwabo, “the main challenge is the convergence of various interests in the DRC and the historical budget constraints but regardless of the difficulties, we, especially as immediate neighbours, are going to do whatever it takes to find a way to stabilise the region regardless of the difficulties because DRC is right next to us.”
Meanwhile, the United States has expressed keen interest in implementation of the Framework.
“The US’s interest is very welcome. I had the opportunity to meet with United States Special Envoy to the Great Lakes, Russ Feingold, and we agreed to work closely. We also agreed on moving beyond resolutions and documents and see some real progress on the ground. This includes pacifying the Kivu region and quickly getting to the better solutions for the communities,” said Mushikiwabo.
Although efforts are underway to ensure stability mainly in the DRC, violence continues to escalate.
The latest surge in violence culminated recently with a fight between the DRC government forces and the M23 rebel group.  In March, about 700 rebel fighters led by ex-political leader Jean-Marie Runiga fled into Rwanda following the fierce fighting between two DR Congo rebel factions of M23.
The recent violence has resulted into the United Nations and the UN Mission in DRC (MONUSCO) reconsidering their relations with President Joseph Kabila’s government following the army’s desecrating of corpses belonging to rebel fighters.
Reports have also emerged, that the DRC government forces are fighting alongside militiamen of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a terror group composed of elements responsible for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.

Title: RPF chose dignity of all Rwandans over dependency - 24Tanzania.com
President Kagame today urged the RPF National Executive Council to examine both the path and methods used towards achieving its goal of development for all and the impact geopolitics continues to have on Rwanda.Speaking to the extended RPF National Executive Committee, President Kagame told all present that RPF had made a choice:
“We can choose to be satisfied with making the least effort, staying where we are and remaining dependent for the rest of our lives even if that means being mistreated. You can choose to be defined by others or you can choose to be who you deserve to be. Our history has taught us the right choice. RPF made the choice to work hard to achieve the dignity Rwanda wants and deserves. We will only be able to benefit from hard work.”
President Kagame added that Rwanda cannot afford to move at a slow pace:
“Our situation does not allow us to take our time. We must work with a sense of urgency to achieve our goals.”
Addressing the issue of those who speak of negotiations with FDLR or blame Rwanda for the conflict in Eastern DRC, President Kagame stressed that this was evidence of those who have the luxury of speaking but suffer no consequences:
“When people continue to uphold genocide ideology, it is a reminder that the path ahead is still long. We cannot take anything for granted. For Rwanda, this is not just about a discussion. The consequences are a death or life issue for Rwanda.”
Speaking on the topic of reconciliation and forgiveness, President Kagame challenged those who claim that all Hutus were forced to apologize for the Genocide against the Tutsi during YouthConnekt event held on 30thJune:
“Why should you have a problem with someone asking for forgiveness on your behalf but not with the one who killed in your name. We are not putting the blame on you, it is those who perpetuated crimes in your name who put the blame on you. The crime was not simply the killing but the silence of many in the face of the persecution of the innocent. Asking for forgiveness for choosing silence while a crime was committed in your name is the right thing to do.”
President Kagame concluded by reminding the RPF National Executive Council of their responsibility as leaders to deliver results and put the interest of Rwandans above any other:
“We want to build a new Rwanda. One that is not just based on empty words but on achievements.”

Title: Former FDLR Combatant Campaigning for RPF – KT PRESS
In 2003, Laurence Mujawayezu returned to Rwanda after several years of hiding in the bushes of Democratic Republic of Congo.
She was part of the so called Front Democratique pour la Liberation du Rwanda FDLR. It is an armed group that participated in the 1994 genocide against Tutsi.
In the aftermath of the genocide, Ngororero was known for having many members in the group whose leaders on United States blacklist of terrorists.
In this life, the maternity was cumbersome for Mujawayezu. In labour, she could not manage the harsh life she was living in DRC bushes.
One morning, she decided to sneak out of her group and returned to Rwanda. But her mission was ‘the last escape to nowhere.”

She told thousands of Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) Inkotanyi supporters gathered at Ngororero stadium where Paul Kagame – party flag bearer was campaigning on Tuesday, that her decision to come back to Rwanda was ‘simply to die in my country.’
“I very well knew I would be killed on arrival to Rwanda,” Mujawamariya said. But when she arrived in the country, she was shocked by the cordial reception she received at Nkamira reintegration camp in Nyabihu district – then in Mutobo, the training center for ex-combatants.
“I had one message; that RDF soldiers were serial killers who would live no one alive. But I got shocked with a reception I had never seen in my life,” she said.
One of the memorable moments, she told RPF supporters, is when she was given food by RDF officers.

“At first I thought that food was poisoned. But I was proved wrong when I shared it on the same plate with RDF soldiers,” Mujawayezu said amidst applause from RPF supporters.
More miracles were still coming. When pregnant Mujawamariya reached delivery period, while at Mutobo demobilization camp.
She asked authorities to give him a chance to deliver at her native area.
“I was taken back home and reunited with my parents and had my delivery at the beautiful Muhororo hospital,” she said.
“Later on, I was thrilled by one of RDF soldiers who approached me and proposed to me to be his lifetime partner. I immediately accepted,” Mujawayezu said amidst laughter from the audience.

Today, Mujawamariya and her happy family are part of a farmer’s association that is worth over Rwf80 million.
When he took the microphone, RPF candidate Paul Kagame said Mujawamariya is a living example of where Ngororero has come from.
He promised more if elected in the next 7 years. According to Kagame, “There is no measurement for development without considering people. And this what RPF puts first.”
Kagame told his supporters in Ngororero district that: “Voting RPF means choosing a determined nation built on a strong foundation.”

Title: Looking for Peace on a Forgotten Island in DRC - Fair Observer
We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.

This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks.
An island on Lake Kivu provides a sanctuary from war in the region.
It only takes one hour to reach the island of Idjwi by speedboat that sails between two of the main cities in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) South Kivu region, Goma and Bukavu. The lush green landscapes and relaxed, smiling faces you see when entering Idjwi could not represent a bigger contrast to Goma, where people are hardened by the everyday prospect of insecurity from crime, volcanic eruptions and violent conflict.
Idjwi is home to around 260,000 people and is located on the Congolese side of Lake Kivu. The population mainly speaks their own language, Kihavu, and apart from a few diesel generators and solar panels on the island, there is no electricity. Life in the small villages and communities evolves around the fertile green fields that make up the island and from fishing in the lake that surrounds it. Poverty is a reality, but so is the laid-back, relaxed atmosphere.
The South Kivu region is in many ways defined by wars and violence over access to power and minerals—the broken-down communities, decimated families, traumatized individuals. Prince Lubambo, one of the six local chiefs on Idjwi, is obviously proud when he explains how his community is nothing like that: “Idjwi does not know war. It’s a peaceful place. That is why when there is war and conflict in other areas, people like to come here.”
When things explode on the mainland, refugees find their way to the isolated and forgotten island, looking for a secure place to stay until peace prevails or to start a new life in safe surroundings.
“We don’t have money to buy land, send our kids to school, and we can’t plan for the future,” says Bernadette who came to Idjwi from Rwanda for the first time in 1994. After losing her former husband in one of the refugee camps that was set up on the island during the genocide against the Tutsis, she continued to the neighboring Kalehe region in 1996. She returned to Idjwi looking for peace in 2009 after her current husband lost eight close family members to the fighting among local militias in Masisi, Kalehe. Despite the tough living conditions, Bernadette sees the family’s future on Idjwi, where they feel welcomed by the community and occasionally find work in the fields.

According to local journalist Yves Minani, 1994 to 1996 was an unusual period when the island received thousands of Rwandan refugees. The refugee camps on the island were infiltrated by Hutu soldiers who were still fighting the war in Rwanda. It was probably the first time the islanders heard gunshots. In spite of this, the local communities welcomed Rwandan refugees who were not involved in fighting and looting.
Butanda, another Rwandan refugee, quickly discovered that it was safer for him to move from the refugee camp to the local village. The chief made sure that he did not have to pay any rent to the family he stayed with. He decided to start a new life on Idjwi and has since made a living for himself and his family—a wife and nine children—from cultivating other people’s land and brewing the local banana wine,kasiksi. For Butanda it was an easy decision to stay in Idjwi: “I do not own any land back in Rwanda, so there was not a lot to return to. As I felt the love and hospitality of the local community here I decided that this was my new home.”
Despite having lived on the island for more than 20 years, Butanda still lives in poverty. He cannot afford to send his kids to school and sometimes receives help from neighbors to make sure his family has something to eat.
These days there are no refugee camps on Idjwi, and the island receives little support from the DRC government. This leaves a lot of responsibility to the chiefs in the local community who are required to report about refugees on the island to the authorities on the mainland, and organize that they are properly welcomed and introduced to the rules of the society. “The refugees have the same rights as everyone else on Idjwi. No discrimination,” says Prince Lubambo. “They are under the Congolese law. If someone behaves badly, they are punished.”
But the refugees don’t commit crimes. They live quiet lives and try to find work, so they can pay rent and provide food for their families. Often, they do not dare to dream of a bright future for themselves or their children. Peace is all that matters for now.
“The eruption of the volcano in 2002. The constant fighting among militias in Kalehe. WhenM23 entered Goma in 2013.”These are the first events that come to Prince Lubambo’s mind when asked about some examples that has led to a large influx of refugees coming to Idjwi. Many refugees’ stay is only temporary, as they want to return to their homes and lives on the mainland. Other refugees have fled from a past they cannot return to and do not have much choice other than to remain at Idjwi.
Florence had never heard of Idjwi when she was sent there in around 2009. She is a small, soft-spoken woman wearing a long brown skirt, matching shirt and a colorfulkitengescarf on her head. Her troubles started when the feared Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia attacked her village close to Walungu in South Kivu. After hiding in the bush, the men in the village decided to take up the fight, and four people, including Florence’s husband, died in the battle.
Immediately after, Florence’s father-in-law wanted her to marry her husband’s younger brother, which she refused. The father-in-law then demanded that she should leave the house and took over all of their land. Florence did not have any land to cultivate and live from. She was alone and pregnant, with six children to care for. A local priest, and a man Florence had never met before, offered to send her and her children to Idjwi and to pay the rent for one year.
Florence felt abandoned and the initial arrangement did not work out well. Eventually she was taken in and given a job by nuns on the island, who are also helping two of her daughters to get an education. She still dreams of returning to her old community, but she has been advised against it by the local priest who believes her husband’s family would see Florence and her children’s return as a threat to their family land. So she stays in Idjwi despite being confused, lonely and constantly worried about her future: “Idjwi is a safe place, but it is not easy to live here. I don’t have my own place and will I ever be able to get any land? I worry what will happen when the nuns leave the island. Will the new nuns accept and support me?”
Both in the DRC and Rwanda, Idjwi is surrounded by mystery. There are rumors that rituals frompowerful sorcerersare part of everyday life on the island. People visit from Bukavu and Goma to seek advice and instructions from spiritually gifted men and women in order to find solutions to their personal problems. According to Yves Minani, witchcraft is not the reason that the population on Idjwi continues to live in relative harmony and have avoided to be part of any conflicts. It is the lake that protects the island. “People don’t want to fight on Idjwi. They fear the lake, just as there is no base to fight from or any places to hide,” he says.

According to astudypublished in 2012, the population on Idjwi rose from 112,000 in 1993 to an estimated 220,000 in 2010, due to one of the world’s highest fertility rates and the large influx of Rwandan and Congolese refugees settling on the island. With the large majority of people living off subsistence farming, it would be natural if the population worried about whether there will be enough space and resources to welcome more people. Minani is confident that this is not the case. “We know about the difficulties that refugees have, so there is solidarity in the society. Perhaps it will be people from Idjwi who need help another day. A lot of people are Christians out here, or follow other religions of love, and we want to do good.”
There are a lot of untold tragic stories on Idjwi, but the refugees do not meet to share their grief and receive support from each other. Some mention the expenses from cooking and providing drinks to guests as a reason why refugee gatherings are not organized, while others seem more comfortable with mourning their loss by themselves.
As the proud woman Kizenyi, who decided to stay on Idjwi after having lost her husband and three out of her four children in the refugee camps, explains it: “No one can know what another person is thinking.”
Kizenyi is now married and lives with a man from the local community who took her in when she had nowhere else to go. The house is modest, but the two of them look happy and relaxed as she tells her story. It’s a painful one, but it could have been much worse if the population of Idjwi had not provided her and other refugees a shelter from the storm.
