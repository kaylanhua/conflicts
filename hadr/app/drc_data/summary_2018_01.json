Below is a summary of key violent incidents, their locations, and estimated casualties.\n\n1. **Beni Region (North Kivu):**\n   - **Incident:** On January 15, 2018, three Congolese soldiers were killed during an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group. The attack took place at the Muzambay military base and involved heavy fighting.\n   - **Casualties:** Three soldiers killed; several more wounded (exact numbers not specified).\n\n2. **Burundi Border (South Kivu):**\n   - **Incident:** From January 24 to 26, 2018, nearly 7,000 refugees crossed into Burundi amid intense fighting between DRC government forces and the Yakutumba militia in South Kivu. Clashes were reported along the DRC-Burundi border.\n   - **Casualties:** Specific casualties from this incident were not detailed, but living conditions for refugees were described as dire, with shortages of food, water, and sanitation.\n\n3. **General Fighting in Kivu:**\n   - **Incident:** An overarching military campaign was declared against the ADF and Yakutumba militia across North and South Kivu provinces, with government forces intensifying military operations following the murder of 14 UN peacekeepers by the ADF in December 2017.\n   - **Casualties:** Reports vary widely, with over 700 civilians and combatants suggested to have been killed by the ADF during 2014-2016. Recent military offensives have also resulted in additional military and civilian casualties, with conflicting eyewitness reports claiming heavy losses for both sides.\n\n4. **Kisangani Region:** \n   - **Incident:** A human rights organization condemned the denial of humanitarian assistance to ex-combatants from the Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de la Lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda (FDLR) in various camps, highlighting ongoing conflicts affecting their families and the broader regional security context.\n   - **Casualties:** While exact figures on casualties from this specific situation were not provided, the lack of humanitarian aid has contributed to deteriorating living conditions for affected individuals and families.\n\nThese incidents underline a complex web of violence involving multiple militia groups, government forces, and civilian casualties. They reflect an ongoing cycle of conflict that has led to mass displacement and significant humanitarian challenges in the DRC, especially in the Kivu regions. The situation remains precarious with potential for further escalation as armed groups vie for control over resource-rich territories amidst a backdrop of political instability."}
