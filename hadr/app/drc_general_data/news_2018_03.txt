UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Monday urged the international community to help carry forward the political process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The international community should continue to work to push parties in the DRC toward a peaceful solution through political consultations and dialogue, and support the mediating role of regional and subregional groups such as the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
He asked the international community to ensure the leadership of the DRC government in solving the crisis, and fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
The DRC government holds the primary responsibility in protecting civilians, he said, the international community should help the DRC government enhance security capacity.
The international community should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the DRC to help the country tackle such challenges as food insecurity and displaced persons. He also asked the international community to help advance socio-economic development in the DRC and invest more in agriculture, infrastructure and other areas.
He said China has always supported the peace process in the DRC and actively participated in peacekeeping in the country. China has also provided humanitarian assistance and has actively participated in the country's socio-economic development.
He said China is ready to work with the international community to paly a constructive role in the DRC's peace, stability and development.

Title: Regional Humanitarian Outlook for the Great Lakes: January - June 2018 - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 9 more
INTRODUCTION & KEY TAKEAWAYS
This Outlook provides an overview of the anticipated humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region from January to June 2018. It focuses on Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and neighbouring countries—including Angola, Kenya and Zambia—that have received refugees and asylum-seekers due to the DRC crisis.
The report covers: drivers of humanitarian crises in the region, particularly the intensification of violence in the DRC; manifestations of humanitarian needs, including record levels of displacement and food insecurity; and constraints to meeting humanitarian needs, including obstacles to humanitarian access and inadequate funding.
The report’s key takeaways are as follows:
• Conflict and internal violence in the DRC have intensified and spread in multiple locations, driving a severe deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the DRC and causing massive displacement, both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region.These trends are expected to continue in the months ahead. Conflict in the neighbouring states of the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan is also expected to continue to impact the humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region.
• The Great Lakes region is experiencing economic slowdown, rising poverty and increasing costs of basic goods as a result of conflict and political instability. Unless political solutions are found to reverse the current trends, levels of vulnerability and humanitarian needs are expected to rise in the first half of 2018.
• Several locations in the region—western Uganda, north-eastern Rwanda and southern Tanzania—are expected to face higher chances of above normal to normal rainfall from March to May 2018, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides.
• Displacement of populations is increasing at an alarming rate. Nearly 2.8 million people were newly displaced inside, into or from the Great Lakes region in 2017, including about 2.1 million newly internally displaced in the DRC following an escalation in conflict and internal violence in multiple locations. There are now about 7.4 million people internally displaced or living as refugees/ asylum seekers in or from the region1—primarily as a result of the conflicts in CAR, the DRC and South Sudan, and the situation in Burundi—and displacement is expected to rise in the months ahead.
• There is a deepening food insecurity and nutrition crisis in the region, largely driven by conflict, leaving some 10.9 million people severely food insecure at the end of December 2017 across the DRC (7.7 million people), Burundi (2.6 million), Uganda (441,000) and Tanzania (120,000). Over 2.2 million children are estimated to be severely malnourished in the DRC and an estimated 70,000 children under age 5 require treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Burundi. Food insecurity could deteriorate in the coming months if fall armyworm is not contained.
• The region is battling simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases. The DRC is facing its worst cholera epidemic in 15 years, and cholera cases have also been reported in Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. A high malaria burden— especially in Burundi—is expected to worsen during the upcoming rainy seasons in the region.
• Humanitarian access continues to be impeded by direct attacks and widespread insecurity in the DRC, with this trend expected to continue in the months ahead if violence intensifies and spreads.

Nearly 2,500 Burundian refugees cross DR Congo border for Rwanda - Xinhua | English.news.cn

BUKAVU, DR Congo, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,500 Burundian refugees from a transit camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Wednesday crossed the border to arrive in Rwanda, according to DRC border authorities.
An official from the DRC's migration service said the Burundian refugees, previously settled in Kamanyola in South Kivu, are currently in Bugarama, Rwanda.
The UN mission in the DRC claimed to have escorted these Burundian refugees to the border with Rwanda for the crossing.
"They told us that they wanted to leave the Kamanyola transit camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and asked the MONUSCO force to accompany them to the border with Rwanda, which we accepted in accordance with our mandate of protection of civilians on Congolese soil," said MONUSCO spokesperson in the DRC, Florence Marshall.
In a statement on Wednesday, an adviser to DRC President Joseph Kabila said Rwanda had agreed to host these refugees on its territory.
"They were not refugees but asylum seekers, and they did not escape. The reality is that the Congolese government has decided not to grant them asylum following their refusal to comply with certain requirements on this matter," the adviser said.
The presence of these Burundian refugees in the province of South-Kivu has been at the root of several controversies between the authorities and the local population. The Burundian government has also repeatedly requested their extradition to Burundi.
According to sources close to the UN Mission in the DRC, these Burundian refugees had decided to go to Rwanda for fear of being forcibly extradited to Burundi by the DRC authorities.

Title: The 758th meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
The Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU), at its 758th meeting, held on 14 March 2018, followed a briefing on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC):
Council took note of the statements made by the Acting Director, Peace and Security, on behalf of the Commissioner for Peace and Security, Ambassador Smail Chergui, and by the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission and Head of the AU Liaison Office in the DRC, Ambassador Abdou Abarry. Council also took note of the statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration of the DRC, H.E Mr. Leonard She Okitundu, the Republic of the Congo, in its capacity as Chair of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), South Africa, as Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Executive Secretary of SADC, Dr. Stergomena Lawrence Tax, and the United Nations (UN).
Council recalled its previous decisions on the situation in the DRC, particularly communiqués PSC/PR/COMM (DCCXII) and PSC /PR/COMM (DCCXXX), adopted respectively on 23 August and 7 November 2017.
Council reaffirmed its commitment to the independence and sovereignty of the DRC, in conformity with the relevant instruments of the AU.
Council reaffirmed the need for the full implementation of the Political Agreement of 31 December 2016 and urged the political stakeholders to comply strictly with the provisions of the Agreement, the only consensual and inclusive framework that would enable the DRC to organise peaceful, free and fair and credible elections. In this regard, Council welcomed the steps taken so far by the Government of the DRC, since the announcement made on 5 November 2017 to organise the Presidential, Legislative and Provincial elections on 23 December 2018. Council took note of the progress made, in particular the completion of the registration of voters by the National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI), resulting in the registration of over 46 million eligible voters, as well as other activities including the approval by the Parliament and promulgation by the President of the Electoral Law in December 2017. Council looked forward to the vote of the National Assembly on the law relating to the allocation of the seats in that body.
Council took note of the commitment made by the DRC to finance the electoral process with its own funds. Council, once again, called upon the countries of the region, other African countries and the international community as a whole to provide the necessary technical, logistical and financial support for the smooth organisation and holding of the elections in the DRC. In this regard, Council requested to expedite the finalisation of the required steps for the speedy operationalization of the International Group of Electoral Experts, which should provide technical support to the CENI in the conduct of the electoral process.
Council welcomed the various initiatives of the countries of the region to assist the DRC in these efforts to ensure the peaceful conduct of the electoral process. Council took note with appreciation of the efforts of SADC, in particular the appointment of a Special Envoy, in the person of His Excellency Hifikepunye Pohamba, former President of Namibia, as well as the opening of a SADC liaison office in Kinshasa. Council also welcomed the mission of the SADC Electoral Technical Committee, which was dispatched to the DRC from 25 November to 3 December 2017, as well as the Political Assessment Mission undertaken by the Executive Secretary of SADC from 30 January to 2 February 2018. Council further welcomed the efforts of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), including initiatives taken by the Tripartite (Republic of the Congo, Angola and the DRC), Gabon, Zimbabwe and whose Presidents recently visited the DRC, to support the momentum in preparation for the election in the DRC. In this respect, Council reaffirmed the need for enhanced coordination of efforts and initiatives of the various actors in the promotion of peace, security and stability in the DRC.
Council deplored the loss of lives, injuries and arrests recorded during various incidents and appealed to the Congolese authorities to investigate the events of 31 December 2017, 21 January and 25 February 2018 and bring perpetrators to account. In this respect, Council welcomed the establishment of a Joint Commission of Inquiry to conduct the necessary investigations into these incidents, including those of 25 February 2018. Council urged the Congolese political actors to show more responsibility and the defence and security forces to demonstrate utmost restraint, at a time when no effort should be spared to establish the conditions for the organisation of free, fair and credible elections, in a peaceful climate.
Council reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the Region of February 2013. Council welcomed the measures considered by the AU, SADC, the ICGLR and the UN, at the meeting of the Guarantors, held in Addis Ababa, from 24 to 26 February 2018. Council encouraged the countries of the region to honour their commitments and to pursue the efforts aimed at contributing to the overall stabilisation of the DRC, within the context of the implementation of the Framework Agreement.
Council expressed its concern about the continuing insecurity and violence in Eastern DRC, as well as in the centre of the country, particularly in the provinces of Kasai and Ituri. In this regard, Council took note of efforts of the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) in restoring security in the areas concerned. Council recalled Paragraph 3 of the communiqué of its 712th meeting and urged the Congolese authorities to take the necessary steps to strengthen security throughout the territory, including with the support of the forces of the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO).
Council, in anticipation of the forthcoming renewal of the mandate of MONUSCO, by the UN Security Council, stressed the need to do everything to ensure that the Mission’s mandate is renewed, taking into account also of the electoral context in the DRC and the expected support of MONUSCO to the FARDC’s operations against the negative forces in Eastern DRC. Council also stressed the need for the operational capabilities of MONUSCO’s Force of the Intervention Brigade (FIB) to be enhanced and to ensure that it is equipped with the necessary resources for the effective implementation of the tasks defined in its mandate.
Council, reaffirming paragraph 8 of the communiqué of its 712th meeting held on 23 August 2017, underlined once again its decision that unilateral decisions to impose sanctions on personalities in the DRC would not provide the environment conducive for the resolution of the crisis in the DRC.
Council remains deeply concerned at the worsening humanitarian situation in several areas of the Congolese territory and appealed to the international community to provide the necessary support to meet the needs of millions of internally displaced persons and refugees. To this end, Council requested the Chairperson of the Commission to take the necessary steps to enable the AU and its Member States to participate actively in the Round Table of Donors on the humanitarian situation in the DRC, scheduled in Geneva, on 13 April 2018.
Council, recalling the Communiqué of its 747th meeting on the organisation of elections in Africa and the Decision of the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union on the Report of the PSC on the State of Peace and Security in Africa, called upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to coordinate the multifarious support that AU member states could provide for the organisation of elections in the DRC. Council welcomed the support provided by MONUSCO to the development of the electoral register and encouraged all partners to extend support to the electoral process in the DRC, without precondition.
Council decided to remain actively seized of the matter.

DR Congo+ 2 more
HIGHLIGHTS
• Conflict continues to displace populations within DRC and to neighboring countries
• UN requests nearly $1.7 billion to meet humanitarian needs in DRC during 2018
• Cholera and polio type 2 remain critical health concerns
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
• The 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requests nearly $1.7 billion to provide humanitarian assistance to 10.5 million of the estimated 13.1 million people in need in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The 2018 appeal is the largest to date for DRC and reflects the widening scope of emergency needs in the country.
• Conflict continues to drive population displacement in DRC, with the UN projecting up to 2.4 million new internally displaced persons (IDPs) by the end of 2018. As of December 2017, approximately 4.5 million IDPs were sheltering across DRC, an increase of more than 100 percent from the estimated 2.2 million IDPs in December 2016, according to the UN.
• Conflict-related disruptions to agricultural and livelihood activities, combined with widespread fall armyworm (FAW) infestations, could reduce harvests in areas of DRC during 2018, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports. FEWS NET projects that displaced and vulnerable populations across central and eastern DRC will likely experience acute food insecurity through at least September 2018.

Title: UPDATE: GITA: Registration opens today for Happy Valley and Petesa residents | American Samoa | Samoa News


Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —Residents of two subdivisions of Tafuna village impacted by Tropical Storm Gita are next on the list of those to register today, Thursday, at the Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) inside the Pago Pago Community Youth Center for disaster assistance.
The DRC, operated jointly by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), opened for registration this past Monday, with registration for Ottoville residents. Yesterday, registration continued for Tafuna village with individuals from Fagaima.
For today, it's for two subdivision of Tafuna:
•     Happy Valley numbers 0001 – 0084; and
•     Petesa numbers 0001 – 0165
Tomorrow, Friday is registration for Kokoland numbers 0001 – 0121.
Saturday is the make-up day for all Tafuna residents that need to register with FEMA.
ASG and FEMA remind the public that only heads of household need to attend the registration. For future village dates and times to register for federal assistance at the DRC, a schedule will be provided by ASG and FEMA.
Another reminder, is for applicants to have on hand the following information when registering at the DRC:
•     Social Security number
•     Address of the damaged primary residence
•     Description of the damage
•     Information about insurance coverage, if applicable
•     A current contact telephone number
•     An address where they can receive mail
•     Bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit of funds
According to the ASG/FEMA notice, individuals with access and functional needs who are heads of household and still need to register should call the Crisis Hotline at (684) 633-9017.
FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance (DSA) Teams will then come to your home to register you — you do not need to come to the DRC. Additionally, those in Ottoville already visited by DSA, with slips that have DSA written on them, do not have to come to the DRC, as they are already registered with FEMA.
And if you have been seen at the DRC and have completed all the requirements, “please make sure you are at home when FEMA inspectors come to inspect your place,” says ASG/FEMA.
Meanwhile, many residents, whose homes and personal property were either destroyed or damaged by Gita, have told Samoa News — over the past couple of days — that they are very pleased with how the registration process is being conducted, with numbers assigned to people during pre-registration.
“If you’re a full time worker, like myself, at least I know there is a certain day for me and others to show up, and not for everyone on island to show up at the DRC all in one day,” said a local resident, who is a private sector employee.
Others workers agreed, saying that at least the person knows when to show up at the DRC so that appropriate time is taken off work to get the registration done and get financial assistance.
So far the registration process has gone well, according to ASG officials and those who have already registered. “Everyone is very patient and there are also Samoan translators on hand to help our people,” said an ASG official.

Title: Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (January - February 2018) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 5 more
OVERVIEW
Since the beginning of 2018, conflict and internal violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has intensified and spread, driving a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the DRC and causing displacement to neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region. More than 59,000 Congolese, 70 per cent of whom are women and children, crossed into Uganda from 1 January to 16 March 2018 in the wake of new violence in the Ituri and North Kivu regions of DRC. Meanwhile, at least 532 Congolese refugees in Angola were reportedly sent back to Kasai region in the DRC in February under unknown circumstances. In early March, some 2,600 Burundians, previously sheltered near Kamanyola in DRC, arrived in Rwanda through Bugarama border, reporting that they feared being forcibly extradited to Burundi.
There is a deepening food insecurity and nutrition crisis in the region, largely driven by conflict, with some 10.9 million people severely food insecure at the beginning of 2018 across the DRC,Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania. Over 2.2 million children are estimated to be severely malnourished in the DRC and an estimated 70,000 children under age 5 require treatment for severe acute malnutrition in Burundi.
The region is battling simultaneous outbreaks of communicable diseases. At the end of 2017,DRC was facing its worst cholera epidemic in 15 years. However, the number of reported cases declined in January and February 2018 compared to previous months. A new outbreak of cholera started on 12 February 2018 in Kwangwali refugee settlement in Uganda, mostly impacting newly arrived refugees from the DRC. Tanzania is also tackling cholera outbreaks in multiple locations.

Title: US Foreign Policy and the Crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo
The United States has a longstanding relationship with theDemocratic Republic of Congo(DRC) that dates back to 1960. The current foreign policy consists of environmental protection and healthcare solutions for Congolese people, but recently, the U.S. has held more interest in the DRC because of its ongoing political and humanitarian turmoil. Members of Congress have urged Presidents Trump and Kabila to address the crisis in the Democratic Republic for the following reasons:
Although the U.N. has sent thousands of peacekeepers, the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues through terrorism. Several armed terrorist groups have been exploiting the DRC for its natural resources, which displaces and abuses Congolese people — an issue that has continued since mid-1990.
Thesearmed militia groupsuse funds from illegally extracting minerals to take over weakly governed sections of the nation and terrorize its citizens; the DRC has an estimated $24 trillion worth of unmined resources.
Political instability has added more tension in the DRC when President Joseph Kabila postponed the 2016 election and continued as president after his term ended. President Kabila has stated the need for “political dialogue,” yet the police force in DRC have discouraged protesting, political expression and political gatherings.
Protesters have experienced extreme action against them by DRC police including the 2015 tear gassing of student protesters and the mass murder of over 40 protesters in January 2016.  The following September, the opposing political headquarters was burned down and an additional 44 protesters were killed.
The crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused Congolese citizens to suffer from extreme poverty, murder and sexual violence because of the ongoing terrorism and political instability. The lack of governance has created an environment in which radical groups are able to freely commit these acts against Congolese people.
On top of the ongoing crimes against DRC citizens, the U.N. and African Union have not promoted sustainable development within the nation.
And add fuel to the issues of development, disease, malnutrition, lack ofeducationand poverty that the Congolese people face every day; many multinational companies have withdrawn their business of buying minerals from the DRC, which in turn has caused multiple job losses and contributed to the nation’s ongoing poverty issue.
Democratic Senators Cory Booker (NJ), Benjamin Cardin (MD), Richard Durbin (IL), Christopher Coons (DE), Elizabeth Warren (MA), Edward Markey (MA), and Sherrod Brown (OH) have urged President Donald Trump to address the crises going on in the DRC.
In a letter to the U.S. President, the six senators urged Trump to improve the implementation of the Coal Minerals Rule, enacting stronger sanctions and nominating key senior State Department posts, all to help resolve the conflict within the nation.
These U.S. Senators addressed the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis as “increasingly worrisome” and requested action if the DRC government refuses to comply.
President Kabila also received a letter from concerned U.S. Senators from both parties, which requested and encouraged the DRC leader to allowpeaceful protestsand political gatherings, to release the political prisoners who are being held, and respect freedom of the press. The letter stated:

“If the [DRC] government continues to refuse to implement the spirit and letter of the [December 31st agreement between the Presidential Majority and a coalition of political opposition parties], the U.S. should use the means at our disposal—including sanctions designations under Executive Order 13671 on DRC, anti-money-laundering regulations, and additional tools available under the Global Magnitsky Act—to affect the incentives of individuals who have strong influence over President Kabila to incentivize them to urge him to change course.”
The U.S. has consistently held a relationship with the DRC, withforeign policiesthat focus on developing the nation and promoting democracy.
Because of the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the United States has goals to encourage development, and USAID has invested in the DRC to promote the following: implementing mandates, the improvement of Congolese livelihood by regional developments, and root for peace should begin in eastern DRC.
More action from the U.S. government, the United Nations and foreign aid to the suffering Congolese people will help the nation tackle these severe issues and ideally promote the growth it needs for success.
