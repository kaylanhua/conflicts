LUAPULA PROVINCE, Zambia, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has started an emergency plan to help asylum seekers from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as their number grows each day.
Zambian President Edgar Lungu on Tuesday toured a transit center for asylum seekers in Luapula province and appealed to the international community to do more to support the government's efforts.

Lungu said while the government and its partners were doing everything possible to take care of the people, there was the need for more support.
"The needs of the refugees and the host community are many. This is a big challenge," Lungu said when addressing the asylum seekers.
The Zambian leader said the country expects to receive more asylum seekers from the DRC as indications so far show that the situation in DRC was likely to worsen.

He further said the country will face challenges to take care of the asylum seekers when they are moved to a permanent settlement.
The number of asylum seekers has now reached 6,009, according to latest figures released on Tuesday by theUnited NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
