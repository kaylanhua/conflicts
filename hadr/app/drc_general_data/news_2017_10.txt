In a deft move to grow its banking franchise across Africa, First Bank Holding Company (FBNH) has increased equity stake in its Congo DRC subsidiary.
FBNH, Nigeria’s foremost  financial holding company, announced the acquisition of the remaining shares in FBNBank DRC Limited (FBNBank DRC), making it FBNH’s wholly owned Subsidiary.
FBNH said this follows its initial investment in FBNBank DRC (formerly Banque Internationale de Credit) in 2011, when the Bank acquired a 75 per cent stake in FBNBank DRC.
Following the acquisition, FBNBank DRC has continued to expand its product offerings, deepen its customer base, and is currently ranked amongst the top five banks serving the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country with a population of more than 82 million.
Commenting on the acquisition, the Chief Executive Officer of FirstBank, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, was quoted in a statement: “This transaction underscores our belief in Sub-Saharan Africa’s growth and our focus on providing a differentiated banking experience throughout Africa. This acquisition further consolidates our already robust African footprint and positions FirstBank to take advantage of emerging opportunities in DRC and the sub-region. This increased investment by FirstBank in FBNBank DRC – the 3rd largest banking entity in the Group, will surely accrete value for shareholders.”
In his remark, the CEO, FBNBank DRC, Akeem Oladele, said: “With 100 per cent holding by FirstBank, FBNBank DRC now has much greater flexibility to deliver differentiated propositions by fully tapping into the resources and innovative capabilities of FirstBank in 8 countries, on three continents.
“FBNBank DRC is also now uniquely positioned to deepen customer reach, broaden offerings and accelerate its growth from top five to top three in DRC.”
The premier Nigerian bank had recorded a strong gross revenue growth of 16 per cent in 2016, from ₦463billion in 2015 to ₦536billion in 2016, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Similarly, FirstBank recorded a 10 per cent growth in profit before tax.
FirstBank provides an array of world-class financial services to both corporate and individual customers, serving over 12 million customers in Nigeria, and more than 300,000 customers outside the country.
Recently, the bank was named the first financial service institution in Nigeria and the West Africa sub-region to have issued 10 million cards, making FirstBank one of only two banks in Africa to have achieved this feat.
The bank and its subsidiaries make up the banking group – with international presence in DRC, Ghana, Guinea, The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Senegal, as well as the United Kingdom and China.
First Pension Custodian Limited, the non-bank subsidiary of FirstBank, is a market leading player in the Nigerian pension industry with assets under custody of about ₦2.6trillion as at December 2016.

Title: 2 dead amid anti-government protests in eastern DRC | News24
Sunday, 22 September
31 Oct 2017
Beni - A Democratic Republic of Congo police spokesperson says at least two people, a police officer and citizen, have been killed in clashes between police and protesters in eastern DRC.
Col. Pierrot Mwanamputu said the two died early on Monday amid demonstrations in Goma to protest President Joseph Kabila's continued rule and the delay of elections.
The protesters are demanding that Kabila step down at the end of the year if new elections are not held.
North Kivu commissioner Gen. Nyembo Placide said investigations are underway to determine who organised the march.
DRC has seen widespread anger over Kabila's extended stay in power after his mandate ended in December and elections were delayed.
The US has warned that DRC will not have the support of the international community if elections are not held in 2018.

LAS VEGAS,Oct. 2, 2017/PRNewswire/ --Decision Research Corporation (DRC), the software solutions provider for the P&C insurance industry, today announced at InsureTech 2017 the immediate availability of its new Rating Engine and Analyzer solutionRS X. The new platform derives its name from its role as the 10thgeneration of the industry-leading enterprise solution, now with entirely new code, advanced automation and functionality and unprecedented speed.
DRC RS X technology offers the fastest, most accurate and cost-effective path to transform insurance products from concept to production. Starting with Excel®, RS X allows analysts, actuaries and product managers to dramatically accelerate the rating development cycle, enabling users to rate, quote and bind faster than ever before.
"RS X is a next generation new product, with a much smaller and efficient technical footprint designed to give business users improved results," noted DRC PresidentKaren Yamamoto. "Our customers told us they were looking for a fast, flexible and more secure way to automate and advance their rate calculation process. RS X Rating offers all this and more, bringing P&C personal, commercial and specialty lines unprecedented versatility in bringing new products to market with improved accuracy and dramatic cost savings over traditional 'load and code' processes."
The new rating engine represents the latest example of DRC developing breakthrough technologies. From the first release seventeen years ago, DRC's rating engine and its components have advanced the industry state of the art for insurance ratings. Today, customers using the RS X Platform enjoy a 90% savings in labor costs and time reduction when going to market.
Cloud-ready RS X runs natively on Windows and Linux to process new programs faster, and features enhanced testing capabilities and metrics for more precisely calibrated results. The new RS X Analyzer now offers a modern user interface, multiple configurable output options and the ability to compare and run multiple programs on one platform.
"The code is entirely new, harnessing the power and efficiency of Go, the programming language developed at Google, but that's simply a means to an end," addedLes McElhaney, VP of Product and Technology at DRC. "The new system brings a logarithmic vs. incremental increase in speed and performance: it's a 100 times faster than before. This allows our customers to model, analyze and implement rating changes ahead of the market vs. reacting to it as they face even more rapidly changing and emerging market opportunities."
