"International partners should help with the DRC's effort to make sure that armed groups in the DRC to abandon the military solution and instead resolve the issues through dialogue and consultation," he added.
Wu also said that efforts must be made to "continue providing necessary humanitarian assistance and economic support to the DRC government."

Title: WHO chief says much larger Ebola outbreak averted | CIDRAP
MONUSCO, Alain Coulibaly / Flickr cc
Today World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, in a press conference on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), said, "We have averted a much larger outbreak, and we will not leave when the outbreak ends."
Tedros, who goes by his first name, said, "We will stay and work with communities and government to stay and provide services for all health needs. This is what the community is asking for."
The press conference came on the heels of Tedros's visit to the DRC last week with Robert Redfield, MD the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also comes on a day DRC officials added 5 new cases to the outbreak total and reported new acts of violence.
At the start of the visit, Tedros said he spoke with health workers in Butembo who were targeted by violence. Their commitment to staying and fighting the outbreak gave him hope that the people on the ground in the DRC will be able to end the outbreak, and he confirmed that security is the number one challenge facing health workers in the DRC.
Throughout the press conference, Tedros said the acts of violence and resistance are not coming from the community, but rather are being inflicted upon the community by rebel forces, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Mai Mai.
"We see more community cooperation and increasing acceptance," Tedros said; "87% of families agree to safe and dignified burials, and over 90% of people have accepted vaccination."
What the community has asked of the WHO, Tedros said, is support in building a health system after Ebola transmission ends. He pledged as much, saying, "Leaving the area is not an option, evacuation is not an option" for the WHO.
In contrast to recent remarks from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) International President Joanne Liu, MD, who said the strategies being used in the DRC were not adequate to end the outbreak, Tedros described signs the virus was on the retreat in DRC.
"There's half as many new cases per week now as there were in January," he said. January saw an average of 50 cases per week, which is now down to 25 cases per week.
Additionally, Tedros said the outbreak has been contained in 11 of 28 communities that have reported Ebola.
Today the DRC's ministry of health recorded five new Ebola cases, three in Mandima and one each in Kalunguta and Lubero. Three deaths were also recorded, including a community death in Mandima.
The cases bring the outbreak totals to 932, including 587 deaths. A total of 210 suspected cases are under investigation.
Also today, both the DRC and Tedros mentioned a new attack in Biena. A mob attacked Biena's General Reference Hospital and a local transit center, and all outbreak activities are stopped for at least today, the DRC said.
Finally the DRC updated its vaccination campaign totals: 87,985 people have been vaccinated since August with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, including 22,336 in Katwa, 20,849 in Beni, and 10,939 in Butembo.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
Wastewater levels are still high, but like other markers are showing a downward trend.

Title: UF’s Disability Resource Center recognized as No. 6 for student access options - News - University of Florida
The University of Florida’s Disability Resource Center (DRC) has been ranked No. 6 in College Magazine’s “Top 10 Campuses for Students with Physical Disabilities.”
Campus-wide efforts, including but not limited to, lift systems across campus, Electronic Information Technology and Accessibility policy development, adaptive yoga and several DRC scholarships, have helped to get the university noticed.
Gerry Altamirano, director of the DRC, said that the center strives to develop new ideas that will continue to make the university accessible, as they see disability as a valued aspect of diversity. He said the DRC aims to make a top 10 collegiate education a reality for students with disabilities.
“There are so many bright and talented future Gators with physical disabilities that we hope will learn about the University of Florida and our commitment to inclusion,” Altamirano said. “We hope this recognition of being named a top institution for accessibility will send the message to future students that there is a place for them at the gator nation.”
The University of Florida’s Information and Technology team shares the DRC’s dedication to campus-wide accessibility, Altamirano said. He said UFIT has created a tool to ensuring all website content is easily accessible.
“The DRC envisions a universally accessible UF community,” Altamirano said. “Through campus partnerships we aim to create equitable learning opportunities by addressing attitudinal, physical and technological barriers.”
As well as being ranked, UF has been recognized as a Gold Standard campus for American College of Sports Medicine’s Exercise is Medicine. The recognition highlights the university’s work with CHANGES, which is part of UF RecSports, DRC fitness assessments and adaptive yoga classes.

Title: Trucks start moving after protests at Zambia-DRC border entry - China.org.cn

CHILILABOMBWE, Zambia, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Truck drivers from southern African countries have started entering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after ending a three-day protest over insecurity, a government official said Thursday.
The drivers had parked their trucks at Zambia's Kasumbalesa border post to protest over insecurity in the neighboring country.
Paul Mulenga, Chililabombwe District Commissioner, said hundreds of trucks were marooned at Zambia's busiest entry point after five drivers were attacked and beaten by unknown people while on transit in DRC.
He said among the attacked drivers were two from Tanzania, two from Zimbabwe and a Zambian, a situation that forced their colleagues to stage a three-day protest, resulting in hundreds of truckers being marooned.
Mulenga said the drivers ended their protest on Wednesday after they were assured of security by the DRC government.
"We held a meeting with our counterparts in DRC and the drivers have been assured of security," he said.
The district commissioner said it will take three to four days to clear hundreds of trucks delivering various good stuffs into the DRC, with trucks stretching 50 kilometers.

Title: DRC is back in the NFC East - Bleeding Green Nation
Filed under:
Retirement was short.
Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie— who turns 33 in April — is coming out of retirement to play for theWashington Redskins, according to a report fromNFL insider Ian Rapoport.
Washington marks DRC’s third stop with an NFC East team. TheEaglesobviously traded for him back in 2011. He spent two seasons with Philadelphia before joining theBroncosin 2013. DRC then signed with theGiantsin 2014 and remained with New York through 2017. DRC signed with theRaidersin 2018 butretired halfway through the seasonsince Oakland was terrible.
In Washington, DRC will be reunited with former Giants safety Landon Collins. Maybe they can relive the glory days of winning 20 out of 48 games during their three seasons together in New York.
Maybe DRC can sign with theCowboysnext year to make a full cycle through the division. He’s a few years younger thanJason Witten, after all.
UPDATE:It’s funny becauseBGN’s Dave Mangels wrote this about Washingtonback on Monday:
Did they sign a retired guy?
Not yet but never count out Bruce Allen.

Title: Democratic Republic of the Congo: Food Assistance Fact Sheet - Updated March 5, 2019 - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 1 more
SITUATION
• Approximately 13.1 million people will face Crisis (IPC 3) or Emergency (IPC 4) levels of acute food insecurity in the DRC through June, according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment.* • The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports that violence, displacement and disease outbreaks continue to contribute to food insecurity in the DRC. In addition to prompting population displacement, conflict in Ituri since September has limited households’ access to fields, undermined agricultural livelihoods activities and restricted access to food. FEWS NET anticipates that vulnerable Congolese populations will experience up to Crisis levels of acute food insecurity in much of southern and eastern DRC through May 2019.
• Nearly 374,000 Congolese nationals have returned to the DRC from Angola, following an expulsion order by the Government of Angola in October, according to the UN. According to relief actors, the population influx has exacerbated humanitarian needs in the greater Kasaï region.
• Intercommunal violence in western DRC’s Mai-Ndombe Province in December resulted in the deaths of at least 890 people and displaced an estimated 16,000 people to neighboring Republic of the Congo.
• An outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease and high level of insecurity in Ituri and North Kivu provinces continue to disrupt normal agricultural and market activities, resulting in a deterioration of food security for affected people.
RESPONSE
• USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide emergency food assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, returnees and vulnerable host communities in the DRC. With FFP support, WFP is also providing food assistance to Ebola survivors and other populations impacted by the disease outbreak. In addition, FFP partners with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to treat severe acute malnutrition in children in eastern and central DRC.
• With USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, FFP jointly funds several non-governmental organization (NGO) partners to provide a multisectoral package of humanitarian assistance in eastern DRC.
• Separately, FFP is responding to the emergency in the Kasaï region by supporting NGO partners to distribute life-saving food to food-insecure and conflict-affected IDPs, returnees and host communities. Additionally,FFP is working with NGO partner, ACTED, to provide emergency assistance to refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) in northwestern DRC.
• Furthermore, FFP collaborates with NGOs Catholic Relief Services, Food for the Hungry and Mercy Corps on multi-year food assistance and resilience activities among vulnerable communities in South Kivu, Tanganyika and Kasaï-Oriental provinces.
