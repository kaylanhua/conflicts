UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on the international community to increase its input to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to overcome its challenges in security, humanitarian development, and others fields.
Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told a Security Council meeting on the situation concerning the DRC that the situation in the DRC is stable on the whole at present, with the national and provisional legislative and executive institutions installed and its economy enjoying steady development.
These positive developments demonstrate that the DRC government has the ability and will to maintain the stability of the country and the effectiveness of the work of MONUSCO -- the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, he said.
Meanwhile, the DRC is still facing challenges, said Wu, adding that the security situation in the eastern region is still grim. It is necessary to assist the DRC with security capacity building.
Peace and stability are the foundation and guarantee for the DRC to advance its political process and realize economic and social development, he said.
The government of the DRC bears the primary responsibility for safeguarding its national security and stability, said Wu, adding that the international community should respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the DRC and fully respect the leadership of the government in handling its own affairs.
All international partners should help to push the armed groups in the country to give up military options and find solutions through dialogue and consultation, he said.
Wu also warned the Ebola outbreak in DRC has worsened, saying it has a great risk of spillover.
There is a need to help the DRC government bring the Ebola outbreak under control as soon as possible, Wu said, adding economic support should continue to be provided to the DRC government.
"International partners should focus on increasing investment in education, health care, infrastructure, and other sectors to help the DRC to increase employment, to improve people's livelihood, to restore its economic development, and to tackle the root causes of the conflict," the Chinese envoy said.
On July 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola in the DRC as a public health emergency of international concern.
Speaking at the same meeting Wednesday morning, Leila Zerrougui, the UN secretary-general's special representative for the DRC, said that the Ebola epidemic has now claimed the lives of more than 1,700 people.
Talking about the UN mission in the DRC, the Chinese envoy said that "sanctions are not an end, but a means to an end".
The UN Security Council on June 26 extended the sanctions regime on the DRC until July 1, 2020. The resolutions impose an arms embargo on armed groups in the DRC, a travel ban on individuals and asset freeze on individuals and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee.
"We hope that the panel of experts will continue to work strictly within the parameters of its mandate supporting the efforts of the DRC government to strengthen weapons management and eliminate the threat of armed groups," Wu said.
China hopes that MONUSCO will continue to increase coordination and communication with the DRC government and actively fulfill its mandated functions, said the envoy, adding that the international community must continue to lend active support to the work of the mission.
According to Wu, since last year, China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance for the prevention and control of Ebola in the DRC through bilateral and multilateral channels, and sent expert groups to the DRC and Uganda to support their anti-epidemic efforts.
China will continue to provide all necessary assistance to the best of ability to Ebola prevention and control in light of the Ebola dynamics on the ground and the needs of the African countries, he said.

Title: Ebola case identified near South Sudan border | CIDRAP
World Bank, Vincent Tremeau / Flickr cc
An Ebola case-patient has been identified just 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) border with South Sudan, the Associate Press (AP) reported today. The story cited South Sudan's health ministry as the source of information.
Officials said the case is a contact of a known Ebola patient from Beni.
Last month, a 5-year-old boy found in Uganda became the first international case of Ebola in this 11-month long outbreak that has otherwise stayed confined to the DRC‚Äôs North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Uganda had in place for months an extensive surveillance and response protocol for Ebola border crossings, but officials in South Sudan told the AP they were not as prepared for the virus.
Today the DRC health ministry confirmed another 16 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), raising outbreak totals to 2,354. Officials also confirmed 15 new case deaths, raising the fatality total to 1,586. A total of 402 suspected cases are under investigation.
Yesterday marked the first time a case has been confirmed in Ariwara health zone, which is located in Ituri province. The Ariwara patient is a mother of five sickened children, who traveled to Ariwara from Beni to hide from surveillance teams. Today the DRC confirmed she had died from the virus.
"To date, 177 family contacts have been listed in Ariwara and 40 contacts have already been vaccinated," the DRC said yesterday.
Today the DRC said an unvaccinated health worker in Beni is among the newly confirmed cases. This lifts the total number of healthcare workers infected to 127, including 40 deaths. Health workers represent 5% of cases in this outbreak.
"New EVD cases continue to occur in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with continued fluctuating transmission intensity, reducing in previous hotspots, but increasing in areas with previously relatively low transmission rates," the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office said yesterday in a weekly bulletin on the outbreak.
In the last 21 days, Mabalako, Beni and Mandima have been the main hotspots, with 33%, 24%, and 9% of newly confirmed cases. Transmission in these towns outpaces transmission in Katwa and Butembo, the main hotspots for the first half of 2019.
The WHO's regional office also highlighted the number of investigations currently undertaken in the DRC, including more than 16,000 case contacts followed up daily, and more than 1,500 alerts assessed in the past week, resulting in 309 suspected cases.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir¬†don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
Wastewater levels are still high, but like other markers are showing a downward trend.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.
Tests are under way on samples from five contacts who reported symptoms.

AU, WHO urge countries to refrain from restrictions on travel, trade from Ebola-affected countries - Xinhua | English.news.cn

ADDIS ABABA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The African Union (AU) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday urged countries to refrain from closing borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade from the Ebola-affected countries.
The urgent call was made by the AU's Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Africa in a statement issued Tuesday, as they reiterated the need for all AU member countries to adhere to recommendations, emphasizing against possible restrictions on travel and trade with the Ebola-affected countries.
According to the AU, as of July 18, 2019, the Ministry of Public Health of the DRC reported 2,532 cases, in which some 2,438 confirmed and 94 probable, with 1,705 deaths and 718 cured, in an outbreak that is the second largest in the history of Ebola since it was discovered in 1976.
"No country should close its borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade, including general quarantine of travelers from the Ebola-affected countries, currently the DRC," the joint AU-WHO statement read.
According to the AU and WHO, such measures on restrictions on travel and trade from the Ebola-affected countries "compromises economies and impede response operations."
"There should be no requirement of certificates of Ebola vaccination for any movement across borders or for issuance of visas, as there is currently no licensed vaccine against Ebola," the joint statement read.
Noting that exit screening is recommended at international airports in affected countries, the two organizations also stressed that "entry screening at international airports or other ports of entry outside countries neighboring the DRC is not recommended as it is not effective and involves large amounts of resources."
"National authorities should work with airlines, airports and other transport and tourism industries to encourage communication and collaboration, and to ensure that the measures adopted are in line with WHO guidance for travel and transport during outbreaks," the joint statement read.
The joint call came after the WHO last week declared the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in DRC as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).
The WHO, in declaring the DRC Ebola virus disease outbreak as PHEIC, mainly took into consideration the first confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost two million inhabitants and close to the border with Rwanda, and the gateway to the rest of DRC and the world, it was noted.
Noting that there have been five PHEIC declarations between 2009 and 2019, the two organizations also stressed that "the declaration of a PHEIC is a call to action."
"It is time for the African continent and indeed the world to redouble our efforts in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a stronger health system," the joint statement read.
The AU, following the WHO's categorization of the Ebola virus outbreak as PHEIC, also on Saturday revealed its decision to deploy more healthcare experts to respond to the Ebola virus outbreak in the DRC.
"The AU will reactivate the African Voluntary Health Corps (AVoHC) and deploy them not just in the DRC but also in other countries within the region," John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa CDC, told a press conference at the AU headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.
Africa CDC, which has been supporting response efforts in the DRC since August 2018, presently operates with 41 experts who were deployed in the field, some of whom are said to be AVoHC members.
The AU, which had previously deployed the AVoHC in West Africa to respond to the outbreak back in 2014 to 2015, said that the AVoHC "will be very useful in the current outbreak."

DR Congo+ 5 more
HIGHLIGHTS
Health actors confirm first EVD case in Goma
Insecurity in Beni continues to result in EVD responder deaths and hamper EVD response activities
More than 140 new confirmed cases recorded in Beni during past 21 days; the highest number of cases in affected health zones
MoH requests $287.6 million for EVD public health response activities
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
From June 30‚ÄìJuly 14, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (GoDRC) reported confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in three previously unaffected health zones, including Ituri Province‚Äôs Ariwara Health Zone‚Äîlocated near the DRC‚Äôs border with South Sudan and Uganda‚Äîand North Kivu Province‚Äôs capital city of Goma‚Äîlocated on the DRC‚ÄìRwanda border. On July 17, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) declared the EVD outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), citing recent events, including active transmission of EVD in eastern DRC and the first confirmed case in Goma.
As the EVD outbreak continues to spread, relief actors have bolstered EVD preparedness activities in eastern DRC and the neighboring countries of Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda. In July, USAID-supported EVD response partners trained health care workers on effective infection control and prevention protocols in North Kivu‚Äôs Beni Health Zone, as well as bolstered screening of populations traveling between the DRC, South Sudan, and Uganda for EVD symptoms, referring individuals to health facilities, as necessary.
Since the start of the EVD outbreak in August 2018, USAID has provided more than $127.8 million in preparedness and response funding in the DRC and more than $8.6 million in preparedness funding to neighboring countries. USAID funding provides life-saving assistance‚Äîincluding infection prevention and control activities, training for health care workers, community engagement interventions, promotion of safe and dignified burials, and food assistance‚Äîto EVD-affected communities in the DRC.

Uganda, DR Congo launch regional cargo tracking system - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Tax authorities of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Tuesday launched a Regional Electronic Cargo Tracking System (RECTS) to reduce the risk of freight diversion between the place of origin and checkpoints.
Dickson Kateshumbwa, commissioner of customs at Uganda Revenue Authority, said the DRC is a strategic market for Uganda and therefore the RECTS is important in regional trade facilitation.
"This system enables revenue authority officers to know the goods in transit, and the tracking of the cargo from Mombasa (Kenyan seaport) will be very easy and goods will be cleared at the border of Uganda and the DRC once," said Kateshumbwa.
Aime Nzoyihera, country director of an aid-for-trade organization TradeMark East Africa (TMEA), which is implementing the project, said the RECTS will be implemented in three phases: the launch of the Uganda office, the opening of the Goma office in eastern DRC, and the launch of the Kinshasa command center.
"TMEA remains committed to facilitating reduced barriers to trade in the region, particularly through enhancement of digital infrastructure which will promote increased trade in the Eastern African region," Nzoyihera added.
The RECTS is now operational in four countries in the East African region, namely Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC.

Title: Joint press release between Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization on the situation of Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic Of Congo - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia & Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, 19 July 2019.
On 17 July 2019, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Director General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, ‚Äúan extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response‚Äù .
As of 18 July 2019, the Ministry of Public Health of the DRC reported 2,532 cases (2,438 confirmed and 94 probable) with 1,705 deaths and 718 cured. In declaring the DRC EVD outbreak a PHEIC, the WHO took into consideration the first confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost two million inhabitants and close to the border with Rwanda, and the gateway to the rest of DRC and the world.
Between 2009 and 2019, there have been five PHEIC declarations.  Declaration of a PHEIC is a call to action. Therefore, it is time for the African continent and indeed the world to redouble our efforts in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a stronger health system.
In view of the PHEIC declaration, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Africa would like to reiterate the need for all Member States to adhere to the recommendations made, emphasising the following:
No country should close its borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade, including general quarantine of travelers from the Ebola-affected countries, currently the DRC. Such measures compromise economies and impede response operations.
There should be no requirement of certificates of Ebola vaccination for any movement across borders or for issuance of visas, as there is currently no licensed vaccine against Ebola.
Exit screening is recommended at international airports in affected countries (currently only the DRC).
Entry screening at international airports or other ports of entry outside countries neighbouring the DRC is not recommended as it is not effective and involves large amounts of resources.
National authorities should work with airlines, airports and other transport and tourism industries to encourage communication and collaboration, and to ensure that the measures adopted are in line with WHO guidance for travel and transport during outbreaks.

Africa CDC and WHO express their gratitude to all AU Member States for the close collaboration with and support to the EVD outbreak response. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that interfere with international traffic to and from the DRC.
Under the leadership of the government of the DRC, Africa CDC and WHO are committed to continuing to coordinate their efforts together with other partners to increase support and control of this outbreak.
Ever since the current outbreak was declared in August 2018, Africa CDC has supported the efforts of the Government of the DRC in several ways. These include deployment of 41 multi-disciplinary public health experts, training of more than 800 local healthcare workers and community volunteers, contributions to surveillance and investigations, and provision of personal protective equipment and GeneXpert machines to health facilities.
Alongside the Ministry of Public Health of the DRC, WHO is leading the coordination of the public health response. WHO is also providing technical leadership in the areas of surveillance, vaccination and case management. WHO has mobilised and deployed over 700 international experts as part of the surge capacity needed to respond to the outbreak.
Africa CDC and WHO strongly call for member states in Africa and the international community to adhere to the requirements of the International Health Regulations (2005) including ensuring that national capacities to prevent, detect and respond to public health emergencies are strengthened.
About Africa CDCThe mission of Africa CDC is to strengthen the capacities and capabilities of Africa‚Äôs public health institutions and partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks based on science, policy and data-driven interventions and programmes.

Title: Ebola outbreak reaches 2,338 cases among violence in Ituri | CIDRAP

Over the weekend and through today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) ministry of health recorded 41 more cases of the deadly disease, including another case detected in a vaccinated health worker.
The continued spread of the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has been marked in recent days by increased cases in Beni, Mabalako, and Masereka. These are the towns and villages where the outbreak began 11 months ago. The health worker who was infected is the outbreak's 126th and was also from Mabalako.
Late last week, the United Nations (UN) voiced concerns about ongoing massacres and ethnic violence in the DRC's Ituri province, according to UN News.
At least 94 people were killed in Djugu territory and 23 in Mahagi territory, including an as-yet undetermined number of women and children, officials said. The violence could influence the Ebola outbreak, as it may prompt more migration into neighboring countries such as Uganda, which a few weeks ago confirmed its first cases linked to the outbreak, in a family traveling from the DRC.
The UN also said the disease was moving into small, forest-based villages such as Alima, where access is "more challenging."
According to the latest updates to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, the DRC will likely confirm 13 more cases of the viral disease today, raising outbreak totals to 2,338 cases. As of yesterday, 1,563 people had died in the outbreak, and 309 suspected cases are under investigation.
Over the weekend the DRC health ministry described a cluster of five cases from Beni, including a mother who fled Ituri province with her children. The family was transferred back to Ituri province for care.
Late last week, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the minister of health in the DRC, held a meeting in Kinshasa to review experimental Ebola vaccine candidates.
Since Aug 8, 2018 ‚Äî 8 days after the outbreak began ‚Äî only Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV has been deployed in a ring vaccination strategy. As of yesterday, 146,316 people had been vaccinated with Merck's product.
During the meeting, Kalenga and other officials considered experimental vaccines from Merck, Johnson & Johnson, CanSino Biologics Inc, and Rospotrebnadzor. Leaders and researchers from the pharmaceutical companies, as well as international experts from the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Bank, among others, also attended the meeting.
"Recognizing that Ebola is an emerging disease and in order to help advance science, the Ministry of Health is open to the option of starting new clinical trials with one or more of these on the sidelines of the current epidemic," the ministry said. DRC officials, however, did not opt to approve any other vaccine for use in the outbreak at this point.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir¬†don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
The case follows two local cases reported in 2023, one in Pasadena and the other in Long Beach.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.
Tests are under way on samples from five contacts who reported symptoms.
