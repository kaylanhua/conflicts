Repatriation of Congolese refugees from Angola to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
• The fourth convoy of the organized voluntary repatriation departed from Lóvua settlement on 7 November at 9:05am, in the direction of Nachiri, Kasai Province, DRC.
• The convoy consisted of nine trucks, seven for passengers and two for luggage. Of the nine trucks that crossed the border, three were hired by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
• Eight of the nine trucks reached Kandjadji, the way station in DRC, on 7 November and due to mechanical faults, the ninth truck arrived in DRC on 8 November 2019.
• 395 refugees were part of this convoy including 228 children.
• The road conditions remain precarious and this delayed the arrival of the trucks in Lóvua settlement. Due to this, refugees spent two nights in the departure center in Lóvua settlement and Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) provided meals as well as breakfast on the day of repatriation as well as snacks and water for the journey;
• The refugees were transported by UNHCR with the assistance of all partners from Lóvua settlement. The convoy went via the Nachiri border to Kandjadji, where refugees spent one night before going to Mungamba, the transit center in DRC.

Title: UPDATE: Return of Congolese refugees from Angola, 11 November 2019 - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 1 more
From 18 August, thousands of Congolese refugees spontaneously left Lóvua refugee settlement in Angola to make their way back home in the DRC.
A Tripartite Agreement was signed on 23 August between UNHCR and the Governments of Angola and DRC, in order to start organized Voluntary Repatriation movements.
On 9 October, the first organized convoy movement left Lóvua settlement with 218 persons on board.
On 14 October, 177 arrived in Tshikapa, and 41 in Kamonia. Since then, two additional convoys have been organized, bringing the total to 844 repatriated so far by UNHCR and partners.
In addition, UNHCR has provided cash and transportation assistance to 15,255 returnees in Kasai and Kasai Central provinces.
Background
Back in 2017, the outbreak of violence in the Kasai region of DRC triggered the displacement of some 1.4 million people, and the flight of over 35,000 refugees to Lunda Norte Province, in Angola. After presidential elections in DRC in early 2019, some refugees approached UNHCR, expressing their wish to return home. UNHCR and partners subsequently conducted “intentions surveys” in May, showing that 85% of the refugees in Lóvua settlement wanted to come back to DRC. On 23 August, UNHCR signed a Tripartite Agreement with the Angolan and DRC Governments to put in place mechanisms for dignified and sustainable returns. Briefed in July by visiting DRC officials about improved living conditions in the Kasais, refugees decided to respond en masse and started to return immediately.
Current situation
Organized repatriations: Organized voluntary repatriation started on 9 October. As of 30 October, 844 Congolese refugees were repatriated in three successive convoys to Tshikapa and Kamonia, in Kasai Province. Repatriates are being transported from Lóvua settlement (Angola) to the border crossing point of Kandjaji, then onto Mugamba Transit Center (where they receive return packages), and then to Tshikapa or Kamonia. Difficult road and weather conditions are posing challenges, nevertheless convoy movements continue. The first convoy to Kananga is planned for mid-November, through Kalamba Mbuji and Bilomba (a way station between Kalamba Mbuji and Kananga).

Title: Consortium readies for launch of 2nd Ebola vaccine in DRC | CIDRAP
© Dominic Chavez, World Bank / Flickr cc
A global consortium that includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ministry of health, Doctors without Borders, the Wellcome Trust, and CEPI (the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), among other groups, is preparing for the introduction of a second Ebola vaccine to be used in the DRC in the coming days.
And in disease transmission developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning about a woman who apparently survived the disease but contracted it again, as DRC officials note three new cases today.
Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, the developers of the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine, will donate 500,000 doses of the vaccine to the consortium, which will distribute and study the tool as part of a large-scale clinical trial in the DRC sponsored by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
Although Janssen's two-dose vaccine has proved to be safe and capable of eliciting an immune response in more than 6,500 humans, there are no human data on its efficacy in preventing Ebola virus infection in an outbreak setting.
Richard Hatchett, MD, CEO of CEPI, said in a press release, "In the midst of this devastating outbreak we welcome the announcement by the Government of DRC to introduce a second experimental Ebola vaccine as part of a clinical trial protocol…. In terms of future global health security, having more than one licensed Ebola vaccine is crucial. It will help improve future supply and enable different vaccines to be used in different outbreak settings and populations, as needed."
The vaccine targets Ebola Zaire, the strain of the virus that's behind the current outbreak in eastern DRC, the world's second largest. Though the outbreak has slowed in recent weeks, it's moving into its 15th month. In May 2019, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended introducing the Janssen vaccine into the DRC outbreak.
Earlier this year researchers in Uganda launched a 2-year clinical trial of the vaccine among healthcare and frontline workers. CEPI also said the vaccine is being studied alongside the Merck vaccine as part of a large phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in West Africa, called PREVAC, that began in 2017.
In the DRC, the vaccine will be given to adults and children over 1 year in two doses (one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV, and the second of MVA-BN-Filo), spaced 2 months apart. According to Bavarian Nordic, which partnered with Janssen in 2014 to develop the vaccine regimen, the first dose primes the immune system, and the second aims to enhance the duration of the immune response.
"No single entity can solve this outbreak which has continued for more than a year," said Paul Stoffels, MD, the Chief Scientific Officer of Johnson & Johnson, in the CEPI release. "The global health community has come together in support of this initiative using Janssen's investigational Ebola vaccine regimen to help prevent its further spread."
In an update today, the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said immunization efforts with the second vaccine will start in Karisimbi health zone in Goma and will progress from there. Goma is in North Kivu province.
To date 245,085 in the current outbreak have been vaccinated with Merck's VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Early clinical data on that vaccine shows it prevents Ebola infection in more than 90% of recipients.
Today Reuters reported that WHO and DRC officials are changing rules about who provides care to Ebola patients after the death of a woman who may have contracted the virus a second time. The case challenges the accepted medical theory that Ebola survivors are immune to reinfection.
The WHO said the woman worked as a caregiver in the high-risk "red zone" of a treatment center in Beni. She was assigned to work with Ebola patients because of her assumed immunity to the virus, officials said. She tested positive for Ebola in July and died before she could be readmitted for treatment. She was pregnant at the time of her death.
Reuters said the WHO and DRC officials have crafted new guidelines that warn of the possibility of "incomplete immunity" among survivors who had mild cases of Ebola, low viral loads, or have compromised immune systems because of pregnancy or other illnesses. They also suggest the woman could have tested as a false-positive the first time she was diagnosed as having the virus.
Ebola survivors have been a vital part of the response effort in the DRC, Reuters said, often spending time and providing extended care to children. Their protective gear is less restrictive than other health workers'.
If confirmed, this would be the first case of reinfection with Ebola since the disease was discovered in 1976.
Finally, the WHO's Ebola dashboard shows three new cases today, raising the outbreak total to 3,272, including 2,183 deaths. Five hundred suspected cases are still under investigation.
The WHO also noted a newly confirmed fatality, bringing the death total to 2,183.
In an update published today, the DRC CMRE revealed a location for yesterday's single case: Mambasa.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
Wastewater levels are still high, but like other markers are showing a downward trend.
The case follows two local cases reported in 2023, one in Pasadena and the other in Long Beach.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.

Title: Russia will continue working with DRC to defeat Ebola epidemic — foreign ministry -  World - TASS
MOSCOW, November 12. /TASS/. Russia hopes to continue cooperating with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to finally defeat the Ebola virus epidemic, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
The foreign ministry said that Moscow follows with concern the developments in the DRC, where 2,192 people died from the Ebola virus. "Despite decreasing rates of the spread of the virus, the relevant committee of the World Health Organization stated on October 18 that the epidemic still represents a public health emergency," the foreign ministry said. "Considering the complicated epidemiological situation in this African country and the request received from DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, the Russian government ordered on September 28 to assist the DRC in the fight against the Ebola virus. Around 398.5 million rubles will be allocated for that in 2019-2020," the ministry added.
"We hope for continuing fruitful cooperation with the Congolese authorities with the aim of finally defeating the Ebola epidemic and of generally improving the epidemiological situation in the DRC," the foreign ministry noted.

Title: Ebola vaccines donated to Democratic Republic of Congo

Posted: 1 November 2019 |Rachael Harper (European Pharmaceutical Review)|No comments yet
500,000 regimens of Janssen’s investigational Ebola vaccine are to be donated to support the Ebola outbreak response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The government of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) has decided to use the investigational Ebola vaccine regimen currently being developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies ofJohnson & Johnsonas part of an expanded public health initiative to help contain the country’s Ebola outbreak.
To helpprotect people at risk of Ebola, Janssen has committed to donate up to 500,000 vaccine regimens in support of a new clinical study in the DRC.
“Johnson & Johnson has been working to provide solutions to the world’s unmet healthcare needs for over a century and the threat of Ebola is one of the most urgent challenges we’ve ever encountered,” saidAlex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “The fact that we’re in a position to help the people of the DRC protect their communities from such a serious threat – just a few years after we pledged to accelerate vaccine development efforts – is a testament to both the ingenuity of Janssen’s scientists, and the power of close collaboration between partners committed to working for the greater good of all.”
Optimal vaccine strategies that have maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak… should be implemented rapidly”
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola outbreak in DRC aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)in July, stating that “optimal vaccine strategies that have maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), should be implemented rapidly.”
In line with recent recommendations from SAGE, the new vaccination initiative in the DRC will offer the Janssen investigational vaccine regimen to individuals at some risk of Ebola infection who live in areas close to the current outbreak zone, with the goal of preventing the further geographic spread of the virus.
The DRC Minister of Public Health, Dr Eteni Longondo, recently announced the country’s decision to introduce Janssen’s investigational vaccine alongside other tools as part of an expanded public health response to fight the Ebola outbreak.
Additionally, the DRC’s Ebola response coordinator, Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe, has shared that the country plans to begin using the vaccine in the border city of Goma, which is a trading hub for the DRC and neighbouringRwanda.
The first batches of vaccine have been shipped to the country.

Title: SeedCLIR: Democratic Republic of the Congo - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo
The SeedCLIR: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) study assesses the enabling environment for seed across six provinces in eastern DRC. Applying theSeed Commercial, Legal, and Institutional Reform(SeedCLIR) analytical tool, the study evaluates the challenges facing eastern DRC’s informal seed sector and the prospects for transforming it into one supportive of reliable access to affordable, quality seed for smallholder farmers.
Central to this goal is developing an enabling environment for private sector investment. An overreliance on donor interventions, weak public sector institutions, significant problems with quality and reliability due to counterfeits, and other issues inhibit or dis-incentivize private investment in eastern DRC’s seed sector.
Accounting for these enabling environment challenges, the study provides a roadmap for developing a commercially driven seed sector in eastern DRC. Sequenced reforms include strengthening and expanding the legal framework governing the seed sector, supporting institutional capacity building, and proposing regulatory measures to support regional integration and promote seed exports, such as accreditation to ensure quality control.
The study is a valuable examination of the challenges and opportunities for developing a supportive enabling environment for seed in fragile, chronically insecure country contexts.

The opportunity to quickly end the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo could be lost due to violence in the country's east, the United Nations said Friday.DRC's President Felix Tshisekedi said earlier this month that the end of the year was a realistic target to stamp out an epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people since it began in August 2018."We're so close to finishing," the World Health Organization's emergency response chief, Mike Ryan, told reporters.But Ryan said he was "alarmed...that the lack of access and a lack of security is now preventing us ending this outbreak.""If we lose this opportunity, we're going to be dealing with that reality for months to come," he said.The affected eastern DRC provinces of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu, suffer from chronic insecurity, with various militia groups operating in the region.Insecurity has complicated the Ebola response since the outbreak began.The use of two new vaccines has helped contain the virus, but WHO has repeatedly stressed that vaccines alone are not sufficient without reliable access to communities affected by the virus."We need security. We need an enabling operation that can provide access for our staff to the front line in a secure manner," Ryan said.

Title: Mnangagwa Denounces Killing Of Civilians – ZimEye



ZimEye
Emmerson Mnangagwa, in his capacity as the chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation has denounced attacks on civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) a rebel group in Uganda and DRC.
Reports suggest that the attacks resulted in the death of about 80 civilians thereby triggering the violent demonstrations against United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) peacekeepers.
In a statement, Mnangagwa expressed condolences to the government and the People of DRC, as well as the bereaved families. Part of the statement reads:
The attacks in Beni have resulted in the death of approximately 80 people, as well as the injury and displacement of many people.
SADC is resolute in voicing its condemnation of the attacks that the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) continue to perpetrate on the civilian population in the DRC.
These remarks have attracted criticism from Zimbabwean observers who said that Mnangagwa was “hypocritical” since he “unleashed a reign of terror” on civilians back home.Analysts also observed that the democratic space in Zimbabwe has been diminishing lately.Credit:NewsDay
