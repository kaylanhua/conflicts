Ugandan president meets UN special team probing killing of peacekeepers in DR Congo - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Tuesday met with the UN special team investigating the recent attacks on peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that left 15 Blue Helmets dead.
In state house statement issued here on Wednesday, Museveni told the team led by Dmitry Titov ofRussiathat the UN is responsible for preserving terrorism in the neighboring DRC.
"The UN operation in DRC and to some extent in Somalia was conservation of terrorism. The terrorists are weak. They have had freedom of movement and space but made no progress in their ventures. If they were strong they would have made a big impact," said Museveni.
The president observed that DRC has a combination of conventional, irregular and terrorist groups, like Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) blamed for the deadliest attack on peacekeepers serving under the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in DRC (MONUSCO) last month.
"It must be the people of the affected country to fight and defeat terrorism within their territory, friendly forces, like the UPDF [Uganda People's Defense Forces], should come in not to replace the people but to strengthen them," he said.
Titov said that the UN looked forward to Uganda's assistance in finding answers into the killing of the Tanzanian peacekeepers in eastern DRC's North Kivu Province.
"He [Titov] observed that the terrorist ADF is a common enemy adding that MONUSCO has got the task of eliminating ADF rebels," said the statement.
Titov's team is visiting DRC and relevant countries in the Great Lakes region in their probe into the Dec. 7 attack, which left 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers, 5 DRC soldiers killed and 53 others wounded.
The UN probe team will examine the circumstances surrounding attacks, evaluate MONUSCO overall preparedness and response to the events and provide recommendations on how to prevent such attacks from occurring in the future.

UN agency for children (UNICEF) on Tuesday requested 268 million dollars to provide vital humanitarian aid to 6.3 million children in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
According to a statement by the agency, the call comes in the context of UNICEF’s 3.6 billion global appeal to provide humanitarian assistance to 48 million children in 51 countries affected by conflicts, natural disasters and other emergencies in 2018.
“The exceptional height of the appeal for humanitarian support in the DRC underscores the extent to which children in the DRC today suffer from the consequences of conflict and epidemics,” said Tajudeen Oyewale, the Representative of the agency in the DRC.
The DRC has become the most affected African country by population movements, with 4.3 million internally displaced persons, including more than 2.6 million children.
These children and their families are dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival.
Provinces of Kasai, North Kivu, South Kivu and Tanganyika are the most affected.
“Violence against children must stop and health services and schools can function normally again,” said Oyewale.
In the DRC, more than two million children suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which is 12 per cent of the number of cases in the world.
Added to this are the cholera and measles outbreaks that hit a record number of children in 2017 and whose impact is likely to expand without an adequate response.
“In order to be able to provide a humanitarian response to meet the needs of children in the DRC in 2018, donors must mobilize.
In 2017, donors have funded only 51 per cent of funds.
If the international community does not take immediate steps to protect and provide life-saving assistance to children in the DRC, an increasingly dark future awaits them, ” said Oyewale.

Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's long-standing winemaker and cellarmaster, Bernard Noblet, is to retire at the end of this month.
Bernard Noblethas been winemaker and cellarmaster at Domaine de la Romanée-Conti since the 1986 vintage, having joined the world-renownedBurgundywine producer in 1978.
Noblet will retire at the end of this month, confirmed DRC’s exclusive importer in the UK, Corney & Barrow – after the news was first reported in French publicationBourgogne Aujourd’hui

He will be replaced by Alexandre Bernier, who has shadowed Noblet in the past few years.
‘It has been planned these last three or four years, with Alexandre Bernier working very closely alongside Bernard Noblet as part of a seamless evolution,’ said Corney & Barrow in a statement.
Noblet took over from his father, André Noblet, who had been head winemaker at DRC since 1946.

Together, they have overseen the rise of DRC as producer of some of the most in-demand wines around the world.
Bernard Noblet, in particular, has witnessed meteoric rises in the price of DRC wines, alongside a broader expansion of the fine wine market to include collectors all over the globe.
For example, DRC Romanée-Conti 1990 has risen in price by around three thousand percent in the past two decades, according to Liv-ex data.

Title: UN appoints ex-Military Adviser special investigator for Burundians’ killings | Pulse Nigeria
Mr Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General in New York announced this in a statement issued in New York.
No fewer than 35 Burundian refugees were killed and more than 100 others wounded by security forces in eastern DRC Sept. 15, 2017 at Kamanyola, South Kivu.
The special investigation will look into the challenges facing the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) in discharging its mandate to protect civilians and provide recommendations on improving the performance of its troops.
Obiakor has had a long and distinguished career in the Nigerian Army and was the Force Commander of the UN Mission in Liberia from 2006 to 2008.
He also served as Military Adviser for Peacekeeping Operations at UN Headquarters in New York from 2008 to 2010.
The refugees were killed in Kamanyola area in South Kivu province’s Walungu territory after they allegedly rioted and the Congolese army made an attempt to control the situation.
Reports said no fewer than 18 Burundian refugees were killed on the spot and the others died the following day from the wounds they sustained.
The refugees were protesting against the decision ofDRCofficials to extradite two other refugees arrested for allegedly making weapons.
There are over 400,000 Burundian refugees in DRC who fled after violence erupted in their country in April 2015 when incumbent President Pierre Nkurunziza refused to leave power after serving two terms and stood in elections for a third term.
The opposition in Burundi had gone on a rampage, attacking police and army while also killing supporters of Nkurunziza.
Thousands of Burundian refugees had fled to neighbouring countries, including DRC, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda.
Out of 40,000 Burundian asylum-seekers, 28,000 who fled hostilities in their country were identified by the DRC’s National Commission for Refugees in Kamanyola.
