Photo courtesy Sotheby’s
Billed as the closest thing to an ex-cellar sale from the famed Burgundian estate there has ever been, the sale will take place on 13 October in New York and feature 100 lots spanning 1937-1964.
The wines were all acquired by the Drouhin family during their time as the exclusive distributor of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti in France and Belgium.
In addition to the DRC, the sale will also feature several bottles of Drouhin’s own grands crus wines from 1959, 1961 and 1962.
Notable highlights are listed below but include three magnums of 1937 Romanée-Conti as well as bottles from 1938, 1945, 1959 and 1964; bottles of La Tâche 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1945 and a magnum of 1959 and bottles of Richebourg 1947, 1959 and 1961.
The magnums of Romanée-Conti has the auction’s highest pre-sale estimate of US$30,00-$40,000 apiece.
Robert Drouhin said: “It is a great pleasure to offer these 100 lots at auction with Sotheby’s Wine in October. These wines span four decades and are filled with remarkable and historic vintages from one of the world’s greatest Domaines. I have had access to these remarkable wines for many years, given that Maison Drouhin was the exclusive importer of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti in France and Belgium from the late 1920’s to the early 1960’s.
“The wines being offered have never left Beaune and have been in my private cellar, undisturbed, for more than 50 years. I have been fortunate to enjoy many of these exceptional bottles with friends and family over the years, and now it is time to share them with others. I hope that the buyers of these wines will know how scarce they are, how good the wines should be, and drink them with friends and family who can appreciate and enjoy them the right way.”
Serena Sutcliffe, MW, honorary chairman of Sotheby’s Wine, added: “It is a great privilege for us to offer this historic collection of wines from the Drouhin family’s legendary cellar. This is an enchanted kingdom in the realm of wine and we are honoured to be asked to bring these precious bottles to auction. The vintages are among the greatest ever made in Burgundy, both extremely rare and gloriously individual.
“The perfect provenance stems from the long relationship between the Domaine de la Romanée Conti and the Drouhin family, two of the most respected names in Burgundy. The breathtaking line-up of DRC’s stunning vineyard sites brings back memories of vocabulary-defying wines that are imbued with the excitement and complexity of tasting at its pinnacle. One can hardly believe that these wines still exist – but, happily, they do!
“The icing on the proverbial cake is in the Drouhin grands crus from three show-stopping years, a complement to the DRC treasures. This is Burgundy’s Gift to the World.”

Title: The Democratic Republic of the Congo Situation: UNHCR Regional Update (July 2018) - Uganda | ReliefWeb
Uganda+ 11 more
The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the world’s most complex and challenging yet forgotten crises. As of 31 July 2018, 782,363 Congolese refugees are being hosted in African countries.
From 1 January to 31 July 2018 alone, some 121,618 Congolese fled to neighboring countries, with a particularly significant increase in refugee flows to Uganda, Burundi and Zambia.
On 17 July 2018, UNHCR together with 43 humanitarian and development partners launched the revised Regional Refugee Response Plan for $547 million to help respond to the needs of Congolese refugees in neighboring countries.
Regional Highlights and Operational Context
A total of 782,363 Congolese refugees and asylum-seekers are being hosted in countries in Africa, that have generously maintained an open door policy in granting asylum to old and new population groups.
The security conditions in the DRC, especially in the eastern and central provinces, remains volatile with sporadic outbreaks of violence leading to displacement of civilians within the country, and across borders to neighboring countries. This has placed the DRC refugee population among the ten largest in the world.
As of the end of July 2018, UNHCR received $37.5 million for the DRC situation, representing only 10 per cent of the total requirements for 2018.
The interagency Regional Refugee Response Plan for the DRC situation has received $59.6 million, as at 17 July 2018, representing only 11 per cent of the total requirements for 2018.
The DRC Humanitarian Pledging Conference was held in Geneva on 13 April 2018. Donors pledged USD $528.1 million. The total requirement is USD $ 1.7 billion.
The first UNHCR - UNDP Joint-Programming Workshop on the RRRP for the DRC Situation, was held on 02-03 July, at the UN Office in Nairobi, Kenya, organized by the Regional Refugee Coordinator for the DRC Situation, Ann Encontre and the UNDP Sub-Regional Platform Coordinator, David Clapp. The joint workshop aimed to strengthen the coordination of humanitarian and development assistance in hosting and return areas of Congolese refugees, as well as other displaced populations of concern, and to start the process of identifying other potential partners, including national and bilateral actors, as well as international and multilateral humanitarian, development and peacebuilding organizations. This initiative encapsulates a new way of working and has brought a new dimension to the concept of interagency cooperation through a coordinated response, as a basis for working as One UN with development actors.

Title: SA says hopeful of peaceful DRC vote | News24
Sunday, 22 September
27 Aug 2018
Continental powerhouse South Africa on Monday expressed confidence that upcoming elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would be peaceful after assurances from the authorities in the troubled country.
Foreign Affair Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said that DRC President Joseph Kabila and the electoral commission had given guarantees to the regional SADC bloc that the country was ready to hold the delayed vote.
"We called the president of the DRC. We called in the electoral commission... by the time they left, we felt very comfortable that they had the situation under control," Sisulu told AFP in an interview in Pretoria.
"From the assurances that we got... we have no reason to doubt that they are not telling us the truth," she said.
The delayed elections are now due on December 23 and Kabila is not standing for re-election.
Kabila took over from his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, after he was assassinated by a bodyguard.
His tenure over the vast mineral-rich country has been marked by corruption, inequality and unrest.
Out of 25 applications, the electoral commission has rejected six presidential aspirants, including ex-warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba.
The DRC has declined offers of advice, oversight and funding to help organise the election in the impoverished country nearly five times the size of France.
Sisulu dismissed reports that South Africa had tried to appoint former president Thabo Mbeki as a "special envoy" to DRC ahead of the elections.

NAIROBI, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) -- Neighboring countries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are tightening preventive measures over an Ebola outbreak in which 10 people have died in eastern DRC.
Tanzanian Minister for Health Ummy Mwalimu said Friday the east African nation was on the highest alert after reports of fresh outbreak of Ebola in the DRC.
"People could be at risk of the deadly Ebola disease owing to interaction with those of neighboring DRC," Mwalimu said. "Tanzanians need to take the highest precaution in order to prevent contracting the disease."
According to her, the ministry had put the people on high alert, particularly those living in regions bordering the DRC, Uganda and Rwanda.
"Precautionary measures need to be taken at all border posts when interacting with passengers who get in and out of the country," she said.
Rwanda's health minister Diane Gashumba has urged hotel managers and transport companies to be the at the front line and part of strategies of Ebola prevention and response.
She met religious leaders, hotel owners and transport companies in Kigali, capital city of Rwanda, where she updated them on the ongoing Ebola outbreak of Ebola in the DRC.
In Uganda, the ministry of health said it was on high alert following the Ebola outbreak, saying all travelers from DRC will be screened before being allowed into the country.
"Our rapid response teams have started training health workers on how to identify potential risks, enhance infection control and increase their level of awareness," Uganda's health minister Ruth Aceng said.
She said apart from a screening center which has been set up at Entebbe International Airport, others have also been put in border districts.
Rwanda has started Ebola screening of travelers entering the country to ensure that any Ebola cases can be detected and isolated.
"Everyone coming in is requested to go through the screening processes for Ebola prevention as per measures set up at borders with DRC and Uganda, Kigali International Airport and ports," said Malick Kayumba, the head of Rwanda health communication center, to Xinhua. "No one will proceed for entrance unless she or he is screened.
He said any person with fever of 37.5 degree and above is requested to go for isolation in the nearest health facility for further checks and follow-up. Enditem

Title: UN Security Council to discuss electoral process in DRC - China.org.cn
视频播放位置
UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council is expected on Monday to discuss the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), particularly the electoral process, which has been at the center of the country's political crisis.
The council will be briefed via video teleconference by the head of the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC, Leila Zerrougui, and the president of the DRC's Independent National Electoral Commission, Corneille Nangaa Yobeluo, diplomats said.
The Security Council meeting comes after DRC President Joseph Kabila has made clear he will not seek another term.
Kabila, who came to power in 2001 after the assassination of his father, President Laurent Kabila, by law cannot run again after his mandate ended in December 2016.
Elections had originally been scheduled to be held in November 2016 to determine a successor to Kabila, but were delayed with a broken promise to hold them by the end of 2017. The polls are finally set to take place on Dec. 23 this year. Enditem

Title: ISS: Is SADC's work in the DRC over? - defenceWeb
President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) told heads of state at the recent 38th Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in Windhoek that he wondered about the purpose of a farewell speech. ‘Is it because I will miss you or is it because you will miss me?’ he asked, provoking much laughter.
Kabila’s second mandate expired at the end of 2016. He has agreed to hand over power at the end of this year. Kabila went on to thank SADC leaders for helping his country over the past 20 ‘long and difficult’ years, notably during the 2006 and 2011 elections. Congolese people would forever be grateful for all the sacrifices ‘including the blood of the sons and daughters of the SADC countries that was spilt on Congolese soil’, he said.
Several thousand soldiers from the region were deployed in the DRC following the ousting of former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in the late 1990s. The SADC intervention by Namibian, Angolan and Zimbabwean troops in 1998 was to protect the regime in Kinshasa against Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
More recently South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi deployed soldiers as part of the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade in the eastern DRC. SADC’s role in the current trajectory to cajole Kabila to step down is however still a matter of debate.
According to the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, the organisation has played a major role in ensuring that the December 2016 agreement leading up to elections in the DRC has been respected and that elections are now on the cards for 23 December 2018. Most elements of this agreement, such as the ending of political repression, do however remain outstanding.
Congolese officials insist that Kabila’s stepping down was an internal matter. In fact, the country doesn’t want any external interference in its affairs. Asked about a possible appointment of former South African president Thabo Mbeki as special envoy to the DRC, a high-ranking DRC official at the summit told ISS Today that the country was refusing any further international mediation and ‘doesn’t need any babysitting’. Kabila also said the electoral process wasn’t the result of ‘any kind of blackmail’.
Whatever the case may be, most SADC leaders, having congratulated Kabila with a sigh of relief, seem to believe the organisation’s task in the DRC is now over. In its final statement of the summit, SADC simply congratulated Kabila and said ‘the government of the DRC will continue to provide the necessary funding and logistical requirements to enable the conduct of peaceful and credible elections’.
When asked about this, Namibia’s President Hage Geingob, the new SADC chair, said despite fears that he would not step down, Kabila had appointed a candidate of his party and even gave a farewell speech. ‘To us this is good news, what more do you want?’ he said. Geingob said SADC couldn’t interfere in a sovereign country such as the DRC and that it was up to the citizens of that country to ‘work for democracy’.
According to DRC experts, logistical support will have to come from somewhere if the elections in this vast country of 46 million voters and very little infrastructure are to be free, fair and democratic. But the DRC has turned down external help. Does this mean the end of the road for SADC in the DRC? And could the DRC’s insistence on self-funding the elections be a stumbling block that could delay the process?
Geingob has been outspoken in favour of democracy, inclusivity and good governance in the region. He also has good credentials on this score in his own country. However, his stance on the DRC might not bode well for the future.
Asked about the troubles in SADC’s newest member the Comoros, where a controversial constitutional referendum took place on 30 July, Geingob reiterated his stance on state sovereignty. He said SADC was there only to help the country be more inclusive, but it couldn’t dictate to it.
Going forward, Geingob and SADC will have to show that it is committed to upholding democracy in the region, given its rather dismal track record. At the 38th summit, for example, little was said about the Zimbabwe situation, except to congratulate the country for ‘peaceful’ elections. In Madagascar, SADC has been fairly successful in mediating behind the scenes, but will have to stay involved to make sure elections in that country in November are inclusive and democratic.
The only firm stance by SADC on a crisis in the region was regarding the situation in Lesotho. In uncharacteristically harsh terms the organisation said it ‘will not entertain any further delays’ in the implementation of the reforms and national dialogue drawn up by SADC several years ago. Ensuring stability in Lesotho and the island states in SADC is important, but ensuring the DRC is placed firmly on the road to fair and democratic elections is even more so.
SADC has various tools and instruments to make sure this happens. This includes the SADC principles and guidelines governing democratic elections. It also has a mediation unit at its secretariat. Kabila’s entertaining speech in Windhoek shouldn’t deter the organisation from using these to continue being involved in the DRC.
