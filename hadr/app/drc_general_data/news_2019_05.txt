Title: What Are The Biggest Industries In The Democratic Republic Of The Congo? - WorldAtlas
TheDemocratic Republic of Congo(DRC) is a country located inCentral Africa. Itscapital cityis Kinshasa. DRC is thesecond largest countryin Africa after Algeria with a total land area of 905,568 square kilometers. It isborderedby South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Angola, Zambia and the Central African Republic. The country has a population of about 91 million people.
It is believed that the net worth of the DRC in terms of mineral resources is US$24.5 trillion. Some of these minerals include copper, cobalt, silver, gold, diamonds, zinc, uranium, tin, manganese, tungsten and cadmium. DRC is popular worldwide for being the largest producer of copper and cobalt. It is also the world’s second largest producer of diamonds. DRC also has hydrocarbon reserves estimated to be around 1.6 billion barrels of oil and 90 billion cubic meters of natural gas. The minerals found in DRC have been underexploited for several reasons such as frequent civil wars, political instability, lack of proper infrastructure, as well as corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Nonetheless, the mineral resources have contributed greatly to the economy of the county. The GDP of the DRC as of 2018 was around US$77.486 billion.
The rich deposits of minerals in the DRC have attracted a lot of foreign investments to the mining industry. Consequently, several mining companies have been set up and operate across the country. The Kinsevere mine, located in the north of Lubumbashi in the Katanga province, is one of the largest copper mines in the world. In 2017, the company led the mining of 80,186 tonnes of copper resulting in three consecutive years of producing over 80,000 tonnes of the mineral. The mining sector accounted for an estimated 11.5% of the GDP of the DRC in 2012. The top mineral exports as at 2017 were refined copper (US$1.9 billion), copper ore (US$960 million), cobalt oxides and hydroxides (USD$721 million), and cobalt ore (US$512 million).
The agricultural industry is amajor sectorin the economy of DRC as it contributes about 21.6% of the value of the country’s GDP. The agricultural sector also employs about 70% of the country’s population. The country has the secondlargest rainforestin the world covering very fertile lands. Over 80 million hectares of DRC’s land is arable with about 4 million under irrigation. The major cash crops grown in DRC are cocoa, coffee, cotton, palm oil, tea, rubber, sugar cane, corn, peanuts, and cinchona tree. On the other hand, the crops cultivated for local consumption include maize, rice, potatoes, cassava, plantains, and cashew nuts. Agriculture is a fast-growing industry which is responsible for the mass production of food consumed by the citizens of DRC. Due to its significance to the economy of the country, the government of DRC has launched a program focusing on the training of farmers, storage of farm produce, and the marketing of agricultural produce. It also collaborates with other non-governmental organizations to educate farmers on modern farming methods in order to increase crop production.
Many rivers and lakes are used for fishing purposes. Fishing in the DRC is divided into two: marine and inland fishing. The country has a very small coastline meaning that marine fishing is only practiced by the artisanal fishermen. Marine fishing contributes to around 4% of the total national fish harvest. Fishing in the lakes and rivers within the country form the inland fishing. Some of these lakes are Lake Tanganyika, Lake Kivu, Lake Edward, Lake Albert, the Congo River Basin, Lake Tumba, and Lake Mai Ndombe. Marine, lake, and river fishing, as well as aquaculture, contributes 12% of the GDP of DRC. The total fish production is estimated to be more than 240,000 metric tonnes per annum. The inland fishing contributes 96% of the annual fish caught. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization’s (FAO) report of 2009, 39.6% of the total animal protein consumed in DRC came from fish. The fishing sector has also created over 700,000 jobs either directly or indirectly.
The manufacturing industry in DRC is not very well developed. However, most of the factories in the country are located in urban centers. The manufacturing industries mostly deal with agricultural products such as sugar, flour, and beverages. Other industries manufacture beer, textile, and clothing, footwear, processing of wood and paper, industrial manufacture of chemicals, cigarettes, glassware, nails, and variety of metal furniture, cement, bricks, and petroleum refining.

Title: Ebola cases top 1,700 in DRC as 4 health workers infected | CIDRAP
World Bank, Vincent Tremeau / Flickr cc
Editor's Note:The original headline for this story was incorrect. Four new cases involve healthcare workers, not necessarily doctors. The headline was corrected later on May 13.
Once again, violent clashes in the Ebola outbreak region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have resulted in a spike of cases. Over the weekend and through today, the DRC's ministry of health recorded 56 new Ebola cases, including 4 in healthcare workers, and 19 new deaths.
The new cases bring the outbreak total to 1,705, including 1,124 deaths. A total of 251 suspected cases are still under investigation. The total number of health workers infected during the outbreak is now 101.
All newly infected health workers, from Mabalako, Kalunguta, Butembo, and Manugurujipa, were unvaccinated. The DRC health ministry reported 13 new cases on May 11, 18 yesterday, and 25 today.
As of today, 114,553 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, including more than 28,000 front-line health workers.
Several cities and villages reported new cases over the last 3 days, including 14 in Kalunguta and 13 in Mbalako. Of the 19 deaths, 15 took place in the community, which raises the risk of further disease transmission.
Two months ago, Doctors without Borders (MSF) withdrew staff from Butembo and Katwa amid increasing security threats, and the operation of Butembo and Katwa's Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) transferred to the ministry of health, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF.
Yesterday the ministry of health published an evaluation of ETC activity, which showed that the average duration of hospital stays has decreased since MSF left the region, with lengths of stay in Butembo going from an average of 9 to 7 days, and stays in Katwa shortening from 7 to 5 days.
The ETCs are now more heavily staffed, the ministry of health said.
"From now on, the whole of the medical staff is Congolese and has been recruited locally," the ministry said. A dedicated admissions staff, more psychologists, and a nutritional care team have also been added to the ETCs.
Moreover, survival rates increased at both ETCs. Excluding patients who die within 48 hours of admission, the case-fatality rate for confirmed patients decreased from 43.4% to 31.1% in Butembo, and from 43.2% to 33.8% in Katwa.
The DRC health ministry yesterday also noted a different success story. Officials said a 42-day-old baby was discharged from the Katwa ETC that day. The baby girl was admitted to the treatment center on Apr 11 with her mother, who died the next day.
"After 30 days of treatment with mAb 114 [a monoclonal antibody', Daniella was cured," the DRC said. "She survived thanks to the work of the health staff and the nannies who took turns at her bedside 24 hours a day but also because she was taken care of as soon as she became ill."
And the health ministry today in its daily report confirmed the death of a man in Butembo who was a suspected member of a local militia group attacking a treatment center. He was killed by security forces.
Also today, the European Union announced it would be donating another €5 million ($5.6 million) to the DRC, raising the total number of funds to the outbreak to €17 million ($19.1 million), the European Commission (EC) said in a news release.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
The case follows two local cases reported in 2023, one in Pasadena and the other in Long Beach.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.
Tests are under way on samples from five contacts who reported symptoms.

Title: EBOLA WARNING: Crisis at MAXIMUM LEVEL, UN warned | World | News | Express.co.uk
Charities are urging authorities to increaseEbolaprevention work to the highest level of emergency response in the DRC as the disease continues to spread at a rapid rate. More than 1,200 people have died from Ebola in the DRC with almost 2,000 reported cases since the outbreak began in August. Yemen, Syria and Mozambique have all been categorised as level-three response countries, and charities are urging authorities to do the same with the DRC. Whitney Elmer, country director of DRC for Mercy Corps, said that declaring the equivalent of a level-three emergency would bring “manifold benefits” to helping authorities control the Ebola outbreak.
She told the Guardian: “There has never been an epidemic of this complexity or size in the DRC.”
She said the crisis required a new structure in line with the scale of the outbreak.
The global humanitarian coordination body, Inter-Agency Standing Committee will meet on Wednesday to consider increasing the emergency response to the Ebola threat in the DRC.
They will study the scale and complexity of the epidemic and assess the risk of failure in responsiveness to the outbreak.

A level-three emergency is implemented when agency responses do not equate to the severity of the crisis.
Last week, the UN announced measures to increase their responsiveness to the Ebola epidemic, including appointing a new emergency coordinator, David Gressly.
Tamba Emmanuel Danmbi-saa, Oxfam’s humanitarian program manager in the DRC said the announcement was a step in the right direction.
He told the Guardian: “This demonstrates the importance that is being placed on the response. Now having this translated into concrete actions to enable to us to deliver services and access funds as required will be critical. The profile of the response needs to be raised.

Speaking about how to increase responsiveness, he added: “The approach does not have to be a normal approach … if it means engaging with leaders of militias, we need to do that.”
Mr Danmbi-saa also said that more funding needs to be given to humanitarian and community work, and stressed the need to help charities safely access Ebola-stricken region.
The risk of Ebola spreading to other provinces in eastern Congo and to other countries remains very high.
Russell Geekie, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement: “A tenth of the global caseload of people in need of humanitarian assistance is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”
