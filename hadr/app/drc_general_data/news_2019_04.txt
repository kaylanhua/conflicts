The Salvation Army Western Division will open a third metro-area Disaster Resource Center this week.

This DRC will join two other area DRCs already in operation, near 84th and Center in Omaha and another at 715 N. 16th St. in Council Bluffs, to make for the total of three distinct operations providing people in need with flood-relief items.
The Sarpy-Cass DRC will serve as a distribution center where people in need can come to pick up flood-relief items. Plus, the Bellevue Christian Center will be partnering with The Salvation Army starting Thursday as the Christian Center is relocating its ongoing disaster-relief operation and inventory to the Sarpy-Cass DRC.
The Sarpy-Cass DRC’s operating hours will be as follows:

Title: Man who fled to UK as child has deportation to DRC halted | Immigration and asylum | The Guardian
Habib Bazaboko is returned to removal centre instead of boarding a flight at Heathrow in apparent U-turn by Home Office
A man who has lived in the UK since childhood and was due to be deported on Saturday on a 6.55pm flight to theDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a country with one of the worst human rights records in the world, has been given an eleventh-hour stay of execution.
Habib Bazaboko, a stonemason, fled to the UK at the age of 11 after his father was murdered in his home country. He has previous convictions, including for grievous bodily harm, but has not committed any crime for nine years.
Speaking earlier in the day from Colnbrook immigration removal centre, where the Home Office detained him two weeks ago, he told the Guardian the prospect of returning to the DRC had him fearing for his life.
“I have no family in [the] DRC, I don’t speak the language, my life is here in the UK. I don’t know why they are forcing me to go back there. I’m so scared of what will happen to me I haven’t been able to sleep.”
He was taken to Heathrow in handcuffs on Saturday afternoon but the Home Office appears to have done a U-turn because when the time came to board the flight the escorts who accompanied him told him he would not be put on the plane and instead returned him to Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, which is next door to Colnbrook.
“My head is pounding, I don’t fully understand what is happening,” said Bazaboko, who has mental health problems. “The escorts told me I would be getting on the plane and then suddenly I wasn’t. I’m so relieved that I’m not on that plane but I don’t know what will happen next.”
The Home Office removes very few people to the DRC – there were just 46 forced removals in the past three years. But recently there has been an increase in attempts; this is at least thethird casein just over a week where the Home Office has tried to deport someone to the country.
Evidence of torture in the DRC has been widely documented. The Human Rights Watch 2019world reportnoted serious human rights violations against opposition supporters, peaceful protesters and human rights activists. The charity Freedom from Torturehas documentedmultiple accounts of torture in the DRC, including a high incidence of rape.
Home Office officials have beentrying to persuadetheir Foreign Office (FCO) colleagues to say publicly that it is safe to return people to the DRC. Internal emails obtained by the human rights organisationJustice First, and seen by the Guardian, show Home Office officials requesting that their British embassy colleagues in Kinshasa issue a statement saying they have no information that people are being persecuted after returning from the UK to the DRC.
FCO officials replied that they did not monitor the treatment of returnees and did not have the resources to do so. They said that to investigate this properly they would need to speak to key officials in the DRC, at the airport in Kinshasa, other embassies, UNHCR, other human rights organisations and returnees, but that they were unable to do this.
Catherine Ramos, from Justice First, obtained the emails disclosed in a freedom of information response and has published a dossier of evidence including references to the emails and 18 cases where people have been deported from the UK to the DRC and suffered ill-treatment including imprisonment, torture and disappearance.
Bazaboko’s solicitor, Toufique Hossain from Duncan Lewis, welcomed the stay of execution and said that further evidence of the risk on return for Bazaboko would be urgently submitted to the Home Office.“We are very concerned that despite the new evidence of persecution of people returned to DRC the Home Office is continuing to try to remove people there,” he said.
A Home Office spokesperson said:“We only return those with no legal right to remain in the UK, including foreign national offenders and failed asylum seekers, where it is safe to do so. We carefully consider all asylum claims, including those made by foreign national offenders, on their individual merits and on the evidence available against available country information and relevant case law.
“Those found to be in need of protection are not expected to return to their country. Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, removal is only enforced when we conclude that it is safe to do so, with a safe route of return.”

Title: Ebola cases grow by 37 in 3 days as DRC has record day | CIDRAP

With 37 Ebola cases reported in the past 72 hours, the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) raged on this weekend and today, and the 16 cases reported yesterday are the most for a single day during this 8-month outbreak.
The new cases raise the outbreak total to 1,154, including 731 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 63.3%. Nineteen of the recently reported cases were in Katwa, the main hot spot of virus activity since Jan 1. Butembo recorded 6 cases, Vuhovi 5, Mandima 4, Beni 2, and Oicha 1.
Beginning Apr 6 and through today, 29 deaths were recorded, including 13 community deaths. Community deaths, which take place outside of Ebola treatment centers, increase the risk of transmission to family members and funeral attendees. Today, the DRC said that, in North Kivu and Ituri, 53% of patients have been infected by family members.
Yesterday the DRC health ministry published details about the laboratory units used by Ebola response teams in the region in an effort to fight the perception held by some local communities that labs were taking too long to give results.
The laboratories used in the outbreak are managed by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB.)
"To date, seven mobile laboratories have been established in Beni, Bunia, Butembo, Goma, Katwa, Komanda and Mangina. This is the first time that the INRB has had the technical capacity to deploy as many mobile laboratories in the field as part of an active Ebola outbreak," the DRC said. The labs in Beni, Butembo, and Katwa handle hundreds of samples collected each day.
Also over the weekend, the DRC health ministry took action to correct one of the common refrains heard in community outreach meetings held in recent weeks: The DRC and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not do enough to invest in the outbreak zones outside of Ebola response efforts.
On Apr 6, DRC's Minister of Health, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, said he had initiated discussions with the federal government to establish a medium- and long-term development plan to "restore the region socially and economically."
The first phase of the plan was implemented this week, with the recruitment of 1,000 people for road maintenance jobs in Butembo and Katwa.
Finally today, the WHO tweeted that, beginning on Apr 15, 8,000 health workers in Rwanda will be vaccinated with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Rwanda, like Uganda and South Sudan, will vaccinate at-risk populations near the DRC border in an effort to protect against the virus.
As of today, 96,664 people have received the vaccine in the DRC, including 24,136 in Katwa and 21,582 in Beni.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
Wastewater levels are still high, but like other markers are showing a downward trend.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.
Tests are under way on samples from five contacts who reported symptoms.

Title: Ivanhoe Mines and the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Reaffirm Joint Commitment to Support the Development of the Country's Unrivalled Mineral Potential and to Accelerate Economic Growth and Employment

Washington, April 8, 2019 - Robert Friedland and Yufeng "Miles" Sun, Co-Chairmen of Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN) (OTCQX: IVPAF), announced today that they were very honoured by the warm welcome that they received from President Félix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during his official state visit to Washington, D.C. last week. Mr. Friedland and Mr. Sun expressed strong support for the president's commitment to attract foreign investment and to accelerate the development of the DRC's unparalleled mineral potential for the benefit of all stakeholders, as a key element of the country's economic transformation.
On April 6, Mr. Friedland and Mr. Sun, along with senior Ivanhoe executives ─ Egizio Bianchini (Executive Vice Chairman), Louis Watum (Managing Director, DRC Operations), Matthieu Bos (Vice President, Corporate Development), Peter Zhou (Vice President, Chief Representative China) and Lily Tshimpumpu (Director of DRC Government Relations) ─ met with the newly elected president. Michael Hammer, United States Ambassador to the DRC, as well as other US and DRC government officials, also were in attendance.
Discussions were focused on updating the president on the rapid progress being made in the development of the Kamoa-Kakula Project, a joint venture between Ivanhoe, Zijin Mining Group and the DRC government, and the Kipushi Project, a joint venture between Ivanhoe and La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines), the DRC state-owned mining company. In addition, Ivanhoe updated the president on the company's exploration programs in the DRC's Lualaba Province (part of the former Katanga Province), that may be expanded to include prospective areas of the country's Kasai Province.
Mr. Friedland and Mr. Sun committed to introduce the president and the DRC government to CITIC Group's broad capabilities to engineer, construct and finance major infrastructure projects, including highways, railways, ports, bridges and agricultural development that could assist with the economic transformation of the DRC. The president extended an invitation to the senior leadership of CITIC Group to visit the DRC for further meetings to discuss a deep and long-term cooperation.
"We share President Tshisekedi's determination to develop a strong partnership between international mining companies and the Democratic Republic of Congo," said Mr. Friedland. "This is a time of historic opportunity for responsible development of the mining sector in the DRC. We look forward to working with all members of the newly-elected government to introduce the Democratic Republic of Congo to investors around the globe. With the continued support of the government, Kamoa-Kakula is on track to become one of the world's greatest copper mining complexes, helping to cement the DRC as a global, top tier copper producer. The Kipushi Project will benefit from similar support and propel the DRC to become a significant zinc producer as well.
"We are confident that CITIC Metal and its parent CITIC Group have the experience, financial resources and a shared commitment to our objective of advancing these world-class projects to production as quickly as possible, and that they have the skills and capability to assist with the country's rail, road and power infrastructure redevelopment and expansion. We also are confident that CITIC's comprehensive capabilities will help Ivanhoe strengthen our business relationships with the DRC government and with local communities near our mining projects.
"This relationship will create value for all our stakeholders in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By working closely with our partners and the government, collectively we will generate widely shared economic benefits that will generate sustainable employment and relevant skills training to ensure that young Congolese will qualify for the thousands of meaningful direct and indirect jobs that will be created."
In the DRC, Ivanhoe and Zijin are focused on the development of a Tier One copper mining complex at Kamoa-Kakula, which was a greenfield discovery made by Ivanhoe's geological team that triumphed after more than a decade of intensive effort. Kamoa-Kakula is projected to become one of the world's top three copper mines. Together with Gécamines, Ivanhoe is undertaking the rebirth of the historic Kipushi zinc-copper-germanium-silver mine. Ivanhoe also is exploring for new copper discoveries on its wholly-owned Western Foreland exploration licences, west of the Kamoa-Kakula mining licence.
The Kamoa-Kakula Project is a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines, Zijin Mining Group, Crystal River Global Limited and the DRC government. The Kipushi Project is a joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines and Gécamines.

Title: Beazley US reveals new commercial package for small enterprises | Insurance Business America
ByLyle Adriano
Beazleyis now offering a new commercial insurance package for small enterprises – with the help of digital solutions provider Decision Research Corporation (DRC).
The new Small Enterprise Package is designed for small commercial customers that encounter complex risks and require specialist insurance products that come packaged with general liability and/or business owners’ coverage, a release said.
The product has launched on the DRC Policy Platform, which allows carriers and MGAs to easily manage policies. DRC’s platform was built with customer centricity and product simplicity as “guiding principles,” it states, resulting in an “intuitive user experience.”
In addition to the Small Enterprise package, Beazley has also launched its environmental liability underwriting system and its Beazley Breach Response (BBR) Rater on the same DRC platform.
“We are pleased by the successful launch of our SE Package offering,” commented Beazley US focus group leader & underwriter Jamie Orye. “DRC has helped us deploy a flexible framework that can accommodate any product our business teams can dream up, using a familiar and easy to navigate processing platform.”
DRC’s platform is so flexible, that Beazley has announced that there are two more products planned to launch on the system next month.
