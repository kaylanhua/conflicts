Title: Refugees reaching Zambia accuse DRC troops of killing civilians: U.N. By Reuters
LUSAKA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government forces have been killing civilians in an insurgency-hit region, prompting the latest influx of refugees into northern Zambia, a senior U.N. official said, citing accounts of asylum seekers.

Pierrine Aylara, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) chief representative in Zambia, told Reuters that the latest asylum seekers had said they were fleeing Congolese government forces.
"It is the government of the DRC that is said to be persecuting its own people by killing, maiming and torching houses, as well as committing rape and looting food stored in granaries," Aylara said.
Thousands of people have been killed and more than one million forced to flee their homes in the DRC's eastern Kasai region since the start of an insurrection nearly a year ago by the Kamuina Nsapu militia. Kamuina Nsapu is demanding the withdrawal of military forces from Kasai.
But U.N. monitors noted in a report that the conflict has shifted away from an insurrection of a specific community towards a wider upheaval far beyond its initial confines.
A rebel group known as Elema was fighting the government mainly with machetes, bows and arrows in Congo's Haut Katanga and Tanganyika provinces, Aylara said.
"The group is not targeting civilians and aims to protect them, but is rather targeting government soldiers, the police as well as government establishments," she said.
The insurgency poses the worst threat yet to the rule of DRC President Joseph Kabila. His refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December prompted a wave of killings and lawlessness across the vast central African nation.
"In turn, government soldiers have become increasingly brutal to the civilian population as they are unable to tell who does and does not belong to this (rebel) group," Aylara said.
DRC government forces were fighting alongside a tribe known as the Abatembo and targeting the Luba and Tabwa tribes who were believed to be sympathetic to the Elema rebels, she said.
Southern African leaders plan to appoint a retired African president to oversee a process aimed at bringing about free and all-inclusive elections in the DRC to help heal the tensions that have caused internal strife and the refugee crisis.

Zambian, DRC leaders to discuss refugee crisis, regional security - Xinhua | English.news.cn

LUSAKA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Edgar Lungu will soon hold talks with his Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) counterpart Joseph Kabila to discuss regional security and refugee influx, Zambia's foreign ministry said Wednesday.
The two leaders, who met briefly during the inauguration of Angola's new President Joao Lourenco, agreed to hold a meeting to discuss various issues, including peace and security in the Great Lakes Region, said acting Foreign Affairs Minister Vincent Mwale.
The Zambian minister told state broadcaster, the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, that the two leaders will also discuss the influx of asylum seekers fleeing unrest from the DRC into Zambia.
The Zambian leader has described the situation as a human catastrophe which requires urgent and collected efforts to address.
Thousands of DRC nationals have been forced to flee into neighboring countries since the start of an insurrection last year in the eastern region of Kasai.

Title: Rwanda’s Modern One-stop Border With DRC Ready – KT PRESS
Construction of the new and modern One-stop Border facility started in 2015 and cost a whooping $9million. Today it will be officially unveiled
Rwanda is unveiling a newly constructed One -stop border post in Rubavu district that borders with the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
President Paul Kagame is expected to officially open the new border facility. Sources across the border indicate that DRC president Joseph Kabila is in Goma city.
La Croniche One-Stop Border Post cost Rwanda $9 million funded by the Howard G Buffett Foundation which also provided $9 million to DRC to build their part that is still under construction.
DRC and Rwanda were meant to build a single facility worth $18 million but DRC refused this arrangement preferring to build its own facility across the border. The two countries therefore decided to divide the money equally- Rwanda has completed her facility while DRC is yet to work on theirs.
Central bank of Rwanda indicates that the country’s informal cross border  export receipts amounted to U$ 66.2 million in the first half of 2016 from U$ 51.6 million in the same period of 2015.
DRC is Rwanda’s largest trading partner. The modern One stop Border is expected to boost flow of goods and people
Of Rwanda’s total informal cross border exports, Democratic Republic of Congo accounts for 65.8% while Uganda accounts for 26.9% and Tanzania 7.3%.
Last year in October, Rwanda and DRC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to seal the Comesa Simplified Trade Regime (STR).
A wide view on the Rwanda side of the One-Stop Border crossing to DRC
Under the STR deal which was enacted in 2009, adjacent country members of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) agree on a list of the commonly traded goods to be exempt from import duty when traded in either country.
Meanwhile, Rwanda installed road lights along the 144km Kigali-Rubavu highway to ensure smooth transit. All roads connectingKigalito all four borders are slated to be lit to boost trade with neighbours-Uganda,Tanzania,Burundiand DRC.
