Kevin Torudag, President of Bankers DRC states, "We are extremely pleased to have a person with Grant's background and integrity join Bankers. Grant understands every aspect of mining in the DRC from exploration through to operating and financing of projects. He has an extensive network of relationships at all levels in the mining sector and will be a driving force behind our strategic initiatives. The dynamics in the cobalt and copper space in the DRC are undergoing a rapid change. Land speculation is escalating, and with a limited supply of properties, this is an impetus for DRC processors to commence a dialogue with Bankers. Bankers has a secure and clean portfolio as well as a proven exploration team and these unique value drivers are attractive to the processors."
Grant Dempsey, President and COO states, "I am excited to join the Bankers team and assist with all aspects of the business in the DRC. Bankers has an attractive portfolio of 26 projects that would be very difficult to replicate and has built an efficient and effective operating team in Lubumbashi that has proven their ability to execute their business plan.  Bankers is uniquely positioned to create value either as a stand alone or in conjunction with other parties who require quality properties and exploration expertise, both being in short supply in this country. This is a powerful combination of a superior land package, a strong operating team, and the relationships we have in the DRC mining community."
Strategic Relationships
The Corporation has been approached by various strategic groups focused on cobalt and copper in the DRC. The scope of strategic discussions is broad and could include, but not be limited to, a strategic investment in Bankers by third parties, joint venture arrangements, the sale of all or a portion of Corporation's projects, a sale of Bankers, a business combination with another entity, or some combination of the foregoing.   At present, there can be no assurance as to what, if any, strategic relationships might be pursued by the Corporation. Bankers does not intend to disclose further details with respect to its strategic relationship discussions unless, and until, the board of directors of Bankers has approved a specific transaction or otherwise determined that further disclosure is warranted.
About Bankers
Bankers is a natural resource company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of cobalt and copper mineral properties in the DRC to world-class Canadian standards. As battery production for EV's surges, demand for cobalt will probably exceed supply for many years. According to a recent report by Transparency Market Research, global sales of lithium-ion batteries are expected to reachUS$70Bby 2024, for a compound growth rate of 11.6% over the years beginning in 2016. Bankers holds rights to 26 separate mineral concessions strategically located in the southern DRC Copperbelt and having a total area of more than 391 km². Bankers has the intention to acquire interests in additional concessions. All concessions were obtained as either new grants or through reputable DRC partners and have clean title with no government involvement, making Bankers one of the few, and perhaps only, junior public mining company in the DRC to have 26 concessions capable of being currently explored. Bankers has an experienced operations team operating in the southern Copperbelt of the DRC. Bankers believes it is the front runner in advancing cobalt and copper exploration by a junior mining company in the DRC.

Title: DRC swipes at Macron after talks with African Union leader | News24
Sunday, 22 September
28 May 2018
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reacted angrily on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron met the head of the African Union, apparently suspecting closed-door dealings on the crisis-riddled country's future.
Government spokesperson Lambert Mende blasted Macron for "dog-whistle remarks" that he made last Wednesday in Paris after meeting with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who is also the AU's current chair.
The comments caused "discomfort, not to say anger" in Kinshasa, Mende told a press conference.
Macron had said, "France supports the initiative taken by the president of the African Union, in strict concertation with the president of Angola," but did not elaborate. Angola President Joao Lourenco was visiting Paris on Monday.
The verbal broadside from the DRC comes in a context of mounting tensions ahead of presidential elections scheduled for December 23.
Countries in central Africa are casting a worried eye, amid fears that the sprawling, volatile state could spiral once more into war, possibly drawing them into it.
DRC President Joseph Kabila has been in power since 2001 and should have stepped down at the end of 2016 after he reached his two-term constitutional limit - a constitutional clause has allowed him to remain in office until his successor is elected.
His presidency has been stained by a reputation for corruption, oppression of free speech and poor governance. The DRC's armed forces are struggling to repress conflict in the vast, lawless east, which is under the sway of multiple rebel groups.
Mende said, "We do not accuse the French president of anything. The question is about knowing what may have been said between him -because he spoke about it - and the president of Rwanda concerning the DRC without us knowing about."
"When the answer comes, if it is unsatisfactory, you can be sure that we will draw all the consequences," Mende said.
"No-one has the right to envisage solutions to our problems without us," he said, condemning "people who are nostalgic for the colonial order" and "closed-door meetings and open plotting against our country's sovereignty."
The representatives of France, Rwanda and Angola were called to the foreign ministry in Kinshasa on Saturday after Macron's remarks.
Previous conflicts in the DRC - from 1996-97 and from 1998-2003 - sucked in countries around central Africa, including the DRC's neighbours, Angola and Rwanda.

Title: DRC planning to allow oil exploration in national parks: NGO | News24
Sunday, 22 September
04 May 2018
Democratic Republic of Congo's government is seeking to reclassify swathes of two Unesco-listed parks so that oil exploration can be carried out there, an investigative group said.
The London-based NGO Global Witness said it had seen documents about a scheme to "redraw the boundaries" of the fabled Salonga and Virunga national parks, home to many of the planet's endangered species.
The move would remove protected status from areas for which oil licences have been awarded, thus enabling exploration there to go ahead, it said on Thursday.
A special commission of ministers and DRC civil servants met on April 27 to push through the plan, it said.
The group said documents signed by DRC's oil minister, Aime Ngoi Muken, set out the legal framework for changing the areas' status.
"The proposals ride roughshod over DRC's Unesco commitments and are incompatible with the parks' World Heritage Status," Global Witness said.
More than a fifth of the Virunga National Park, the oldest wildlife reserve in Africa, would be affected by the reclassification, it said.
The minister, asked to comment on the report by AFP, said he had "no knowledge about this scheme" but if it existed, "we are not afraid to embrace it".
In February, said Global Witness, DRC President Joseph Kabila authorised oil blocks that partially overlap Salonga - home to up to 40% of the world's bonobo population.
Virunga's denizens include hippopotamus, elephants and some of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas.
In 2015, a British-listed oil company, Soco International, gained a licence to operate in a block in Virunga. It later announced it had ceased to hold the block after an outcry, Global Witness said.

Title: Ebola cases drop as more specimens test negative | CIDRAP
United Nations, Marie Frechon / Flickr cc
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) officials said some suspected cases of Ebola have tested negative for the disease, dropping the total number of cases to 51 from 54.
Of the cases, 35 are confirmed, 13 are probable, and 3 are suspected, the DRC health ministry said yesterday. Two of the suspected cases are new, 1 in Iboko and 1 in Wangata, the urban zone located within Mbandaka, a city of more than 1 million people.
The DRC said teams of health workers are going "house to house" in Mbandaka to trace any patient contacts and conduct extensive surveillance in the city. Authorities also said that three patients who left the Wangata Ebola treatment center last week were found in the Bongonzo neighborhood of Mbandaka.
The DRC Minister of Health, Oly Kalenga, MD, said response coordination teams will be monitoring the Bongonzo neighborhood in the coming days.
Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) announced during a press conference it would be shifting its focus to the rural epicenters of the outbreak, Bikoro and Iboko, after offering reassurance that the ring vaccination efforts in Mbandaka were under way. Vaccination began in Bikoro on May 28 and should begin in Iboko later this week.
Vaccine uptake has been high among more than 900 case contacts already identified by the DRC, WHO, and Doctors without Borders (MSF). In its most recent situation report, the WHO said that from May 21 to May 28, 426 people have been vaccinated.
The WHO also detailed a massive boots-on-the-ground campaign focused on informing potential case contacts in the DRC.
"A total of 700 social mobilizers in Wangata, Bolenge, and Mbandaka are engaged in Ebola prevention communication and social mobilization. A total 91 local facilitators in the three affected health zones have been trained on Ebola prevention," the WHO said in its situation report. "More than 80 community members are trained and will carry out activities in 6 targeted health areas in three health zones in Bikoro, Ntondo, and Iboko."
The WHO also maintained that the risk of contracting Ebola in the DRC is extremely low for travelers, and said no restriction on travel or trade need to be implemented at this time.
As the ring vaccination campaign grows and surveillance continues, the WHO said more funding is needed to contain the outbreak.
"The amount of funding needed for the overall Ebola Strategic Response Plan has increased from  US$26 million to US$57 million, based on the new planning assumption and requirements following the spread of the disease to Mbandaka," the WHO said.
Earlier today, the Australian government pledged $4 million to the WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) formally affirmed its commitment to aiding the DRC in its fight against Ebola.

Also, sequencing confirmed N1 and identified two HA mutations, one of which could affect vaccine development.
The findings come on the cusp of the Northern Hemisphere flu and respiratory syncytial virus seasons and rising US COVID-19 cases.
A study suggesting thatnirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir don't prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes or long COVID is also being called into question.
Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team.
The new findings come from the ongoing RECOVER trial and build on results seen in a 2023 trial.
While sequencing shows similarity to the virus in cattle, the epi investigation might not be able to pinpoint a source.
Wastewater levels are still high, but some indicators such as hospitalizations trended downward.
The case follows two local cases reported in 2023, one in Pasadena and the other in Long Beach.
The CDC received reports of 22 more imported cases over the past week, raising the total to 74 from 5 states.
Tests are under way on samples from five contacts who reported symptoms.

Title: Lighting up Africa: Of DRC's potential to power up half the continent | Africanews
Please select your experience
Copy/paste the script below
OTHER WIDGETS
with Jean-David Mihamle
In this segment, Jean-David Mihamle talks about DRC’s potential to power Africa out of darkness, by boosting the continents electricity generation.
DRC’s Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala last week chaired a meeting on the country’s electricity sector. Five strategic action points were identified in line with adjusting the country’s national electricity sector development policy:
DRC is said to have an extraordinary potential of churning out 100,000 megawatts, made possible by the River Congo which is the biggest river in Africa by discharge volume with a flow of 41,600 m3/second. According to the experts, it is capable of producing 46,000 MW, energy that can light up at least half of the continent.
But all this ambition would be affected by issues like:
The mining industry, which is the nuts and bolts of the Congolese economy, alone, has a deficit of between 750 and 800 megawatts.
A lot of money would be needed to realize these power dream. Experts estimate $ 100 billion. No doubt that this is not a hard target. As Jean-David opines that money can easily be availed if there is a clear vision that highlights a clear legal and institutional framework, which integrates the pan-African private sector, promises profitability and more importantly a vision that is able to attract other African countries.
South Africa and Nigeria have shown interest in buying electricity from the DRC.
This means that instead of always waiting for funding on this and that like manna falling from the skies, multilateral institutions with a voluntarist, bold and visionary initiative, can help the DRC spearhead electrification in the continent.

Title: Former Partner Leads Glencore Even Further Up the Creek in DRC | INN
Mining giant Glencore now has even more on its plate in the DRC, with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler seeking damages against the company.
Mining giantGlencore(LSE:GLEN) now has even more on its plate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler seeking damages against the company to the tune of almost US$3 billion.
Efforts by Glencore to avoid the ire of the US government have led to the company being accused of breaching royalties agreements with the Israeli businessman.
A Congo court has placed a freezing order on the Swiss trader’s assets, including Katanga Mining’s (TSX:KAT) Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) and the Mutanda mine.
A company affiliated with Gertler, Ventora Development, has alleged that Glencore is required to pay US$695 million from Mutanda and US$2.28 billion from KCC to Gertler in future royalties.

Glencore is assessing the impact of the freezing order on Mutanda and KCC’s operations in the DRC, noting that it may materially adversely impact such operations.
KCC is expected by Glencore to produce 150,000 tonnes of copper in 2018, while Mutanda produced 192,000 tonnes of copper in 2017.
After the news, Katanga Mining saw its share price plunge by 18.78 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Glencore’s share price fell 2.6 percent in London.
The new orders will further frustrate Glencore’s operations in the DRC, where it’s already fighting against anattempted dissolution of KCCby joint venture partner Gécamines, and iswrestling with regulatory changesby the government, which is seeking to raise more royalties and taxes from mining companies.
Glencore bought out Gertler’s shares in Katanga and Mutanda in 2017 for US$960 million, agreeing to pay royalties to the businessman.
However, Gertler was later designated a “Specially Designated National” (SDN) by the US government and had blocking sanctions imposed on him and affiliated businesses, preventing him from dealing in US dollars, and complicating any dealings Glencore could have with him.
The company ceased paying royalties, saying that the agreement had been made prior to his designation as a SDN. As a result, Glencorestrenuously denied it was in breach of any agreementsin apress releaseon Friday (April 27).
“Glencore denies that Mutanda and KCC are in breach of any of their obligations under their respective agreements with Ventora … and also entirely rejects Ventora’s calculation of the value of the future royalties allegedly owed to Ventora. Mutanda and KCC will vigorously contest the freezing order and any subsequent proceedings,” the company said in the release.
Analyst Tyler Broda from RBC Capital Markets downgraded Glencore from a top pick to outperform, saying that the new development “complicates the DRC picture,” and that Gertler’s working relationship with the DRC president means that the courts are unlikely to reverse the freezing order in the near term.
The hubbub surrounding Glencore and its assets in the DRC triggered Canadian mining company Ivanhoe Mines (TSX:IVN) to clarify its position in the DRC,saying in a press releasethat its projects in the country have “absolutely no relation” to Glencore, Gertler or any legal proceedings, and that all of its relationships are rosy.
“Ivanhoe is productively advancing our projects through respectful, cordial and constructive relationships with all of our partners and stakeholders,” said Ivanhoe Mines Executive Chairman Robert Friedland.
On Monday (April 30), Glencore’s share price closed on the London Stock Exchange at GBX 359.42, down 2.6 percent, while Katanga closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$0.78, down 20.81 percent.

Macron had said, “France supports the initiative taken by the president of the African Union, in strict concertation with the president of Angola,” but did not elaborate.
Angola President Joao Lourenco arrived in Paris on Monday and voiced his support for agreements that provide for elections to be held in DRC in December this year.
“The subject we are dealing with is not a conspiracy but the great need to show President Kabila that he must respect the agreements. I will meet President Kabila in the coming days to continue discussions with him until the elections,’‘ explained Lourenço.
Tensions in DRC are rising ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for December 23.
Countries in central Africa are casting a worried eye, amid fears that the sprawling, volatile state could spiral once more into war, possibly drawing them into it.
DRC President Joseph Kabila has been in power since 2001 and should have stepped down at the end of 2016 after he reached his two-term constitutional limit. However, a constitutional clause has allowed him to remain in office until his successor is elected.
His presidency has been stained by a reputation for corruption, oppression of free speech and poor governance.
The DRC’s armed forces are struggling to repress conflict in the vast, lawless east, which is under the sway of multiple rebel groups.
“When the answer comes, if it is unsatisfactory, you can be sure that we will draw all the consequences,” Mende said.
“No-one has the right to envisage solutions to our problems without us,” he said, condemning “people who are nostalgic for the colonial order” and “closed-door meetings and open plotting against our country’s sovereignty.”
The representatives of France, Rwanda and Angola were called to the foreign ministry in Kinshasa on Saturday after Macron’s remarks.
Previous conflicts in the DRC, from 1996-97 and from 1998-2003 sucked in countries around central Africa, including the DRC’s neighbours, Angola and Rwanda.
