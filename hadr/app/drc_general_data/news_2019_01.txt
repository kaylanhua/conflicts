Ebola spreading into "high security risk area" of DRC: UN - Xinhua | English.news.cn

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is not only spreading but is extending southward into a "high security risk area," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that in recent weeks there has been an increase in reported cases of Ebola in the DRC's North Kivu Province, most notably from the Katwa health zone, where response teams have faced pockets of community mistrust," he said.
"The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area," Dujarric told reporters at a regular briefing, referring to one of DRC's conflict zones.
Working under the government's leadership and in collaboration with other agencies, the WHO said teams were actively working to build community trust and scale up the response in these areas.
There have been more than 650 cases of Ebola reported as of Jan. 24 in the latest DRC outbreak, including 443 deaths due to the highly contagious hemorrhagic disease, according to the WHO.

Title: DRC seeks UN help against Rwanda rebels on border | News24
Sunday, 22 September
31 Jan 2019
Democratic Republic of Congo's government has asked its UN peacekeeping mission for help against Rwandan rebels planning operations against Rwanda from inside Congolese territory, the UN said on Wednesday.
Leila Zerrougui, chief of the UN mission known as MONUSCO, said Kinshasa asked in a letter for peacekeepers to "thwart" FDLR Hutu rebels who were mustering in an eastern province near Rwanda's border.
The Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) have in the past carried out cross-border attacks on Rwandan forces from rear bases in the DRC.
In his letter DRC Defence Minister Crispin Atama Thabe said rebel brigades had moved from North Kivu into South Kivu province where they would be able to join a rebel commander planning operations in Rwanda.
DRC "cannot accept being used as a rear base for a foreign rebel movement against one of its neighbours," the minister said in the letter, which was shared on social media and with the local press.
The minister did not give details about the kind of help the government wanted UN peacekeepers to provide.
Zerrougui said the UN peacekeeping mission praised Kinshasa's cooperation and had notified the Rwandan authorities.
The DRC's government said on Monday it had extradited two FDLR rebel commanders to Rwanda as part of a legal agreement.
One of the two men extradited was Bazeye Fils La Forge, an FDLR spokesperson.
The FDLR has been fighting in eastern DRC for decades.
The authorities in Rwanda say the group's leaders took part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which some 800 000 people, mainly minority Tutsis, were slaughtered by the military and by Hutu militias.

Title: Republic of Congo: Population Movement - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) MDRCG016 - Congo | ReliefWeb
Congo+ 1 more
Description of the disaster
On Sunday 16th December 2018, some villages in the Province of Mai-Nambiar, Democratic Republic of Congo, neighboring the district of Makotimpoko in the Republic of Congo (CongoBrazzaville) were affected by inter-ethnic conflict between the Banunu and the Batende. The fighting has resulted in 400 fatalities and the destruction of property. A large number of the population of the conflict affected areas were forced to cross the river Congo and find refuge in several localities in the Cuvette (Konda and Youmba) and Plateaux (Makotimpoko, Bouemba, Patrick) areas in Congo-Brazzaville.
Families stress that apart from the issues around land ownership, this conflict is directly related to the presidential elections in DRC. The elections that took place on the 30 December have exacerbated the situation with further increases in unrest following the announcement on 10 January that the opposition candidate has provisionally been declared the elected president. The two ethnic groups are in support of different political parties, with the majority of members of the Batende community supporting the FCC coalition while most Banunu nationals were in support of Lamuka, the opposition coalition. Prior to the 2006 and 2011 elections, the clashes between the Banunu and the Batende were also reported.
The vote was supposed to mark DRC’s first uncontested democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence but had been marred by accusations of irregularities and risk of widespread unrest.
The DRC Government and its partners, including UN bodies conducted a multi-sectoral assessment from December 23rd to 26th 2018 to assess the situation and needs of the displaced populations. According to this assessment, more than 11,408 people from the DRC (7,425 in Makotimpoko, 3,049 in Bouemba and 934 in Mpouya) have taken refuge with host families or are without shelter. Other more recent numbers from assessments in DRC report more than 78,928 people from the DRC have taken refuge with host families or living in spontaneous settings in Congo Brazzaville. According to media reports there have been 800 fatalities, with this number likely to increase as it is thought many families who were hiding in their homes died when their houses were burned in Boguende communities.

	South Sudan begins vaccinating against Ebola

Health care workers and other front-line responders in South Sudan are being vaccinated against Ebola amid a worsening outbreak of the disease in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, WHO announced.
Fearing cross-border spread from the DRC,Uganda began vaccinating front-line workersin November. According to WHO, more than 2,600 health care workers in eight of that country’s high-risk districts have been immunized. WHO reported that Rwanda also is planning to vaccinate front-line workers.
As of Jan. 26, the DRC health ministry said there have been 733 probable or confirmed cases and 459 deaths during thecountry’s 10th Ebola outbreak, which is occurring in two northeast provinces.
“It is absolutely vital that we are prepared for any potential case of Ebola spreading beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo,”MatshidisoMoeti,MBBS,MSc,WHO regional director for Africa, said in a news release. “WHO is investing a huge amount ofresources into preventing Ebola from spreading outside DRCand helping governments ramp up their readiness to respond should any country have a positive case of Ebola.”
With help from WHO, UNICEF, the CDC and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the South Sudan health ministry began vaccinations in Yambio, Gbudue State, on Jan. 24, according to WHO. The agency said health care workers in other high-risk areas bordering the DRC, including Tombura, Yei, Nimule and the capital of Juba, also will be offered the vaccine.
Merck has dispatched 2,160 doses of the vaccine to South Sudan, according to WHO. The vaccine protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which is currently circulating in DRC.
WHO said it has sent more than 30 staff members to train health care workers on clinical practice principles and protocol procedures for administering the unlicensed vaccine. Meanwhile, the South Sudan health ministry has established 17 screening points to better detect potentially infected travelers entering the country. Nearly 1 million people have been screened so far, according to the release.
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has helped provide access to the Ebola vaccine stockpile and has given $2 million to support vaccination in countries that neighbor the DRC, according to the release.
“Although research is ongoing, the evidence so far suggests the Ebola vaccine is a highly effective tool to help stop epidemics and can be used to prevent this national outbreak from becoming a regional one,” Gavi CEOSeth Berkley, MD,said in the release. “Vaccinating front-line workers and health workers in South Sudan border regions will be crucial: an outbreak in South Sudan would be deeply concerning.”

Title: Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (November - December 2018) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 4 more
OVERVIEW
The number of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) more than doubled from the end of October (293) to the end of December (623). As of 31 December, 368 deaths had been reported. Insecurity continued to impact Ebola-affected areas. In November, armed men attacked an EVD burial team at Mutembo village, between Beni and Butembo, and in December three health facilities in Katwa were set ablaze by unknown people. In the area near Beni, North Kivu, more than 1,300 cases of human rights violations against civilians were recorded from October to December, including physical attacks, killing, pillaging and kidnapping. Although the number of cases reported in Beni decreased in November and December, the outbreak intensified in Butembo and Katwa. The risk of national and regional spread therefore remained very high, with Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda working to heighten cross-border surveillance and preparedness levels.
Cholera affected nearly 8,800 people in the Great Lakes region in November and December, most of them in DRC and Uganda.
Although the number of regions with active outbreaks decreased, over 5,700 new cases, including 100 deaths, were registered in the DRC provinces of Haut Katanga, Kasai-Oriental, Sankuru and Tanganyika. In Uganda, over 2,700 new cases were reported. In Burundi, Rumoge District in - which experienced torrential rains and flooding along Lake Tanganyika in December – a new outbreak was reported, with more than 110 suspected cholera cases, including one death, recorded between 25 and 31 December. Tanzania reported 380 new suspected cholera cases, mainly from Momba district in Songwe region. Meanwhile, the measles outbreak in DRC spread from seven to nine provinces, with nearly 10,000 cases, including over 108 deaths, reported by December. In Uganda, 53 districts had reported measles outbreaks by the end of 2018.
At least 10,000 refugees and asylum seekers – 7,000 from DRC – arrived in Uganda in November and December. Refugees arriving from DRC reported fleeing due to inter-ethnic clashes and fear of election-related violence, while refugees from South Sudan reported fleeing fear of attack due to the conflict. Burundians arriving in Uganda indicated several reasons, including insecurity and family reunification. In DRC, there were reports of new internal displacement, with close to 100,000 people newly displaced due to renewed violence since September in Djugu Territory of Ituri Province. Meanwhile, the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Burundi decreased to less than 140,000.
Karamoja in Uganda experienced an unusually harsh dry season, causing a decline in livestock production, rising food prices and scarce local food supply. In parts of Karamoja, people are facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) levels of food insecurity, while refugees hosted by Uganda remain reliant on humanitarian food assistance

Title: Actor Ryan Gosling urges credible election results in DRC | News24
Sunday, 22 September
08 Jan 2019
As tensions build in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the delay in announcing the election results, actor Ryan Gosling and activists with whom he has published a book about the central African country, urged officials to announce a credible winner.
DRC's electoral commission on Sunday delayed indefinitely the announcement of the results of the December 30 vote. However, the influential Catholic Church said it can see a clear winner from the 40 000 observers it posted across the country and it urged the electoral commission to publish the true results in "respect of truth and justice."
The US government also urged the electoral commission to present accurate results that correspond to results announced at each of DRC's 75 000 polling stations. President Donald Trump said military personnel had deployed to Central Africa to protect US assets from possible "violent demonstrations".
DRC's government forbids speculation about the winner before the official results are announced and it has imposed an internet blackout over the country to prevent conjecture on social media.
Gosling took photos in DRC that illustrate the book "Congo Stories," published last month with text written by activist John Prendergast and other DRC analysts.
Brutality and exploitation
Commenting on the edgy situation in DRC, Prendergast, joined calls for accurate results of the polling.
"It is impossible to ignore the mountains of evidence of a stolen election and a stolen government," said Prendergast. "If they steal the final electoral result, it will just compound the losses of the Congolese people, whose resources and rights have been taken by DRC's leaders, present and past."
Gosling called on consumers of smart phones, many of which contain strategic minerals from DRC, to make informed choices to help improve the lives of the Congolese people.
"I've learned that if DRC was the beneficiary of its own natural resources it would be one of the richest countries in the world as opposed to one of the poorest," wrote Gosling, responding by email to questions from The Associated Press.
"I've also learned that despite centuries of brutality and exploitation, there is an incredible movement in DRC among people who are using the living nightmares they have endured as fuel to make the hopes and dreams of their families and country a reality," he wrote.
"The momentary choices that we make as consumers can have lifelong consequences for the people of the countries from which those products are sourced," wrote Gosling. "We have an opportunity as consumers to support those who are being exploited in their efforts to achieve justice and live the lives to which they are entitled."

DRC's election is an opportunity for change from the better, according to the activists with whom Gosling collaborated on the book.
"The people of DRC are hungry for change after 17 years of a lack of governance under Kabila," said Chouchou Namegabe, a Congolese journalist. "These elections represent the possibility to have the first democratic transition of power in DRC in its post-independence history ... Congolese people need a choice for who governs them, though this election will probably not deliver that."
The international community should use economic sanctions to press DRC to deliver good governance, said Prendergast, founder of the Enough Project, which campaigns for international firms to disclose where they source strategic minerals from DRC and other African countries.
"From the colonial era up to the present, the state in DRC has been hijacked for the personal benefit of ruling elites and their business partners, leaving nothing for developing the nation," wrote Prendergast to AP. "The solution is a combination of supporting DRC's courageous reform movements along with imposing international sanctions and other consequences on the kleptocratic networks - led at this time by President Kabila - that continue to impoverish DRC and foment violence in the country."
International help
Multinational corporations, particularly the manufacturers of smart phones and computers, should encourage stability in DRC, said Fidel Bafilemba, a Congolese civic leader who works closely with the Enough Project. He said that eastern DRC is has instability because of armed militia that control its lucrative mines.
"DRC needs accountable leaders who will ensure compliance with DRC's laws, and the government needs to hold its generals accountable for the human rights abuses they oversee," said Bafilemba. "DRC also needs international help in the form of sanctions against the leading smugglers of conflict gold, which has become the largest funder of armed groups in eastern DRC. And DRC needs help from electronics, jewelry, and other companies, who should invest more in helping build up the conflict-free trade from eastern DRC."
DRC needs change that will improve the lives of its people, said journalist Namegabe.
"There is a serious risk of seeing violence and instability continue in the country. There are more than 200 active armed groups, and many potential triggers where social tensions could burst into violence very quickly," she wrote, saying that DRC's more than 80 million people will work to improve the country. "One of the main qualities of the Congolese people is a stubborn hope for a better future."

AU postpones dispatch of delegation to DRC - Xinhua | English.news.cn

ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The African Union (AU) has postponed the dispatch of a high-level delegation to the the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to an AU statement on Monday.
The delegating was originally scheduled to leave for the DRC on Monday.
Last Thursday, African heads of state and government met at the AU headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa on issues related to the post-election situation in the DRC, and called for the suspension of the proclamation of the final results of the Dec. 30 elections, noting that there were "serious doubts on the conformity of the provisional results."
It was at that meeting that the leaders agreed to urgently dispatch to the DRC a high-level delegation comprising the chairperson of the African Union and other heads of state and government, as well as the chairperson of the AU Commission, to interact with all Congolese stakeholders, with the view to reaching a consensus on a way out of the post-electoral crisis in the country.
The AU statement on Monday said that the 55-member pan-African bloc has taken note of the decision of the Constitutional Court of the DRC proclaiming the final results of the presidential and national and provincial and legislative elections.
The statement called on all concerned to work for the preservation of peace and stability and the promotion of national harmony in their country.
It reiterated the AU's continued availability to accompany the DRC in this critical phase of its history, as well as its solidarity with the Congolese people.
The February 2019 Summit of the Union will receive a report on the efforts made, in solidarity with, and support to, the people of the DRC, the statement said.

Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Malanji has stated that the call by President Edgar Lungu for a government of national unity in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was necessary to bring peace and security to the country.
Speaking live on SABC, Hon. Malanji said that even in the event that all processes were complete, this could not guarantee peace and security in the DRC.
And South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu has called for a UN Mediation team to help arrive at a political Settlement.
Hon. Malanji who is the Chairperson of the SADC Ministerial Committee on the Organ of Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation and Head of the SADC Electoral Observer Mission in the DRC said DRC was holding the 3rd election in 60 years. He recognized that the advisory was unprecedented and historical because of the unique position of the DRC.
Hon. Malanji thanked the DRC government for funding their own elections and for ensuring that the Congolese people expressed themselves through the ballot.
Hon. Malanji said the government had overcome numerous challenges including security threat and disease to have this elections and that some regions did not participate because of the Ebola and areas of insecurity, adding that although there was a legal process, the interest of DRC and its peace was secured and SADC was committed to a peaceful Congo before and after elections.
Hon. Malanji said Zambia agreed with South Africa’s proposal to the United Nations Security Council to send mediation team and appreciated the role that the community of SADC had given to the DRC.
Hon. Malanji said DRC, had 600 political parties and attracted over 15,000, and said that CENI also did well to ensure that transparency.
However, a member of the Felix Thisikedi team based in Johannesburg, Claude Ibalanka expressed concern that the proposal might undermine the process. and called for a possible government of national team after the court process was complete. Mr Ibalanka denied that the outcome of the recent elections was engineered by the out-going President Joseph Kabila.
But Hon. Malanji dismissed the fears, saying the matter was a strong proposal for the sake of peace and that President Lungu consulted widely to ensure that if engandered, lasting solution and peace will prevail.
The so called ‘governments of national unity’ are an affront to democracy and have shown in the past that they do not work. Did not work in Zimbabwe nor Kenya. They are a compromise to appease sour losers. Democratic elections require that a winner is declared and has a mandate of the electorate according to the prevailing rules of the constitution. Why do we then need to begin accommodating people/parties who were not voted in according to the rules? I thought we had moved past this nonsense in recent years. Lungu should be care in promoting such initiatives as he can rest assured that in 2021 if PF wins by a small margin (which is more likely than and landslide), the UNPD will push of a compromise in the form a government of national unity.
@blabla. I beg to differ. For true purposes of transition GNU works, provided that all parties involved participate in decision making. It worked in SA, Namibia, Kenya (Kibaki and Odinga coalition). The winner takes all kind of democracy isn’t always the best especially were they are rising tensions.
Lungu has been AWOL for 6 days now.
He went to RSA to brief Ramaphosa on DRC elections & for a routine medical check-up.
Democracy in Zambia has crumbled, hijacked by a thieving cartel. PF00Ls & Zambians have no moral right to comment on DRC.Jesus said, “Before removing the speck in your friends eye, remove the log in your own eye”.
How many times HH went in for treason because of not “recognizing” some one as president??Dialogue first with Kambwili and invite Tshekedi to witness how it done.
Kekekeke listen ifyo abena Kaizer is saying that PF has government of national unity with MMD.That MMD government spokesperson is now PF spokesperson.
Govts of National Unity are lazy solution ….and don’t slave anything if there is a winner why push for one. What SADC is saying is that they are also not sure about the result
Where is this lazy man called Edgar Lungu?
You Gay fagot Jay basterd you read quack news at Zambian Witch Doctor and come here to make noise. get lost Moth fckrAsk your relative Sishuwa or your nephew Lloyd.
You’re still an arss hole in 2019 no sign of growth from your Under 5 state. Pillock
LT editor look at the small boyi without internet etiquette Bonehead spewing nonsense
Idi*ot you think it’s fine for you to poke ridicule at the Republican President and the First Lady. Get the fck outta here Under 5 bushman. Go jerk off to Kainde’s oxtail.
IT’S AS A RESULT OF LIMITED VOCABULARY THAT ONE TURNS TO ABUSIVE LANGUAGE. MAN UP THE KITCHEN IS YET TO HOT.
BaKontwe – Profanity is the common crutch of the conversational cripple…these are small boyis like Sunday who just stumbled into the party don’t mind them!!
He thinks its his job to protect his master Lazy Lungu like a dog without thought….I for one dont have any dispute with this boy!!
He has gone to waste time and to consume high quantities of alcohol such that he can temporally lose his mental functions about problems in Zambia .
My man, Mr. Kudos!! Chebe ichi mwana cha ndoshi!!!!
The opposition has taken the matter to the Constitution Court which is yet to decide on it. In additionSADC has not sent a delegation to DRC to talk to all parties and verify the claims by both parties. The call for the a Government of National Unity is therefore premature and baseless. The true winner is known and the Court is yet to decide. What is wrong with African leaders? They so incapable of resolving simple issues. CENCO has the results and they know who the winner is.
You let Kabila over stay his term in office, now you want to protect him from prosecution. He is suppose to be heading to the ICJ, so that a precedent is set.
Its midway January 2019 still no news on the pointless National airline from the dull foool Brian ..please get back our $30 million from EA you thievies
“Dull Fool Brian”Very good internet etiquette from a self-proclaimed ‘enlightened’ minion squatting in the UK. Piece of sh*it wancker
“dull foool Brian”Very good internet etiquette from a self-proclaimed ‘enlightened’ minion squatting in the UK. Piece of sh*it wancker
If he is so smart ..why has he not launched his silly airline? My dull small boyi its because numbers do not add up
“dull foool Brian”Very good internet etiquette from a self-proclaimed ‘enlightened’ minion squatting in the UK. Piece of sh*it wancker
Being called a foool is not an insult ..anyway you wouldn’t know the difference small boyi raised in massage palour!!
Foool – a person who acts unwisely or imprudently; a silly person. Ah coming to think about it, stupid would have been better, having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense.
What about “sufferer of genetically induced !imbecility”?
Just ignore that trib.al Jay Gay. Trying to die for Trib.al Hacks but imagine even death rejects them!
Here is another one dumba$$ who was born yesterday fixated with tribalism …with this dull one here I think his mom and daddy are brother and sister
Yaba iyi cadre yeve bakuchayaHa ha ha ha
GNU is an appeasement tool for sore losers ,an accomodative settlement for losers is not allowed in sports and its never allowed for failed students.Destabilize a country,threaten peace after losing and you get rewarded with a post-that’s sickening to reward such wrongs.
This what happens when you rig elections to return strangle hold on power for absolute power’s sake.“PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa is in a catch-22 situation over whether to implement recommendations of the Motlanthe commission of inquiry into the August 1 post-election violence, which urged him to engage opposition MDC leader Nelson Chamisa to move the country forward,” reported Newsday.Zimbabwe is in this economic mess of serious economic meltdown because it is in a political paralysis. Zanu PF has ruthlessly imposed itself on the nation as the only party to govern the country regardless of the party’s performance.Yes Mnangagwa is caught in a catch-22 situation but one a lot more subtle than having a dialogue with Chamisa. He rigged the elections to return his strangle hold on…
Continued… He rigged the elections to return his strangle hold on power for absolute power’s sake but also to make sure he and his fellow Zanu PF thugs are never held to account for all their past misdeed of looting, rigging elections, staging coups and mass murders.By rigging the elections Zanu PF was assured of the party’s iron grip on power but it also forfeited the people’s democratic mandate, making it an illegitimate regime.
How can Zimbabwe function properly when sanctions are still in place?? MDC failed to prove rigging allegations when given chance just like all African opposition. Odinga got wise and abandoned the western influenced African opposition which cries rigging all the time. He successfully nullified an election but realised that he still can’t win as his opponents supporters will still vote for their candidate just like his own. The west now realising that democracy is taking root in Africa and their influence is fading as Africans can now make their own decisions-like side with China-are trying to discredit African leadership as corrupt and dictatorial so its people can reject it so they can usher in their puppet regimes-Kainde, Chamisa, Fayulu, Maimane etc. Sadly they are creating single…
…party states as the populations see through their puppets and reject them at the ballot. Then the familiar “rigging” cry bellows and the court contests begin. Its all a scheme to undermine African leaders and democracy by the western powers and prevent the rising influence of the Eastern powers. Truth is democracy has worked in Africa. Administrative glitches or teething problems by electoral bodies still exist but ballot tampering doesn’t. All over Africa western puppets are losing elections. Development takes time but populations are sensitive to western schemes as information is more readily available and more Africans get education.
ECL IS IN SA consulting on the DRC ISSUE I HOPE JJ HAVE GIVEN ANSWER, BUT HE IS ALSO WITH MULONGOTI THEIR
Hawing wet dreams?
Government of national unity my sorry A$$. Apply it pa Zed, before trying to export that nonsense beyond your borders.
imwe baKongole. Simulima nolima. we shall close our borders and see who brings food in. Just listen to voices of wisdom and do the needful.
Most of you are busy denouncing the proposal BUT you are failing to give context the real problem!! I am NOT a fun of Lungu but I believe this is a GOOD JOB SO FAR!! The PROPOSAL TO RECOUNT VOTES IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THE OPPOSITION,CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, UN SECURITY COUNCIL, EU,AU, GREAT LAKES REGION WANT and is in LINE WITH THE LEGAL PROCESS TAKEN BY THE “losing” OPPOSITION. Further the results at Provincial and Legislatative assembly give Kabila absolute majority,in which case Kabila’s coalition will appoint a Prime Minister and Ministers to run the government which will MAKE PRESIDENT VERY WEAK TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS.Kabila himself is NOT GOING INTO RETIREMENT as by LAW he is a SENATOR FOR LIFE (UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT) and thus may even be Speaker of the Senate! These issues must be…
Looks like SADC know results can be manipulated
All this reference to ECL and DRC issues is just a way to make him appear relevant and give the impression he is around and working (when in truth, we haven’t heard from him in almost a week) He has not appeared in person – all these are statements being attributed to him by others.

Title: Ebola news: WHO order South Sudan vaccinations in 'VITAL' effort to contain disease | World | News | Express.co.uk

The Ministry of Health of South Sudan, with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners, has begun administering the jab to front-line staff fighting the spread of the disease. Vaccination began in Yambio, Gbudue State, but health workers in Tombura, Yei and Nimule as well as the capital city, Juba, will also be offered the vaccine. These are high-risk areas bordering theDRC, now experiencing its tenth outbreak of Ebola, with a total of 733 cases and 459 deaths reported since August 1.
Neighbouring countries have not reported any cases ofEbola, but preparedness is crucial.South Sudan, which has been independent from the Republic of the Sudan since 2011, has been given 2,160 doses of the Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) from Merck, the vaccine’s developer.The vaccine offers protection against the Zaire strain of the virus, the one affecting DRC at present.Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said: “It is absolutely vital that we are prepared for any potential case of Ebola spreading beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“WHO is investing a huge amount of resources into preventing Ebola from spreading outside DRC and helping governments ramp up their readiness to respond should any country have a positive case ofEbola.”Vaccination is one of a number of preparedness measures which South Sudan is putting into place, with WHO deploying more than 30 support staff members.It has helped train 60 health workers in order to administer the yet-to-be-licensed Ebola vaccine.To detect any travellers entering the country who may be infected with the virus, the Ministry of Health, with the support of its partners, has established 17 screening points. Almost one million people have been screened to date.

WHO is working to improve engagement with communities, active surveillance for the disease at the community and health facility levels, and infection prevention and control methods.It is also strengthening local laboratory capacity to test samples taken from people suspected of having Ebola more effectively.Protective gear for responders has been stockpiled in a dedicated warehouse.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in addition to its work making the Ebola vaccine stockpile available, is providing $2million to support theWHO’s vaccination efforts in countries neighbouring the DRC, including South Sudan.

Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi said: “Although research is ongoing, the evidence so far suggests the Ebola vaccine is a highly effective tool to help stop epidemics and can be used to prevent this national outbreak from becoming a regional one.“Vaccinating front-line workers and health workers in South Sudan border regions will be crucial: an outbreak in South Sudan would be deeply concerning.”Uganda beganvaccinatingfront-line workers in November 2018, with more than 2,600 health workers in eight high-risk districts immunised so far.In DRC itself, more than 66,000 people have been vaccinated – more than 21,000 of them health and other front-line workers. Rwanda also has plans to vaccinate its front-line responders.
The yet-to-be-licensed rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has been shown to be highly protective against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus in trials.Though not yet commercially licensed, it is being provided under what is known as “compassionate use” in the ongoing Ebola outbreak inNorth Kivuprovince of DRC as part of recommendations from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.The vaccine was also used in the Ebola outbreak in Equateur province of DRC in May–July 2018.Though the latest outbreak is serious, it is still dwarfed in size by the outbreak which spread throughout several countries in west Africa between 2013 and 2016 which resulted in the death of 11,310 people.
