Title: Disabled students face struggles with inundated resource centre | Varsity
AVarsityinvestigation reveals significant challenges facing the Disability Resource Centre, from slow response times to major inconsistencies in its interactions with colleges

A Varsity investigation has found significant challenges facing the University’s Disability Resource Centre (DRC), from slow response times to major inconsistencies in its interactions with colleges.
While almost unanimous in their praise of DRC staff, student testimonials suggest a pattern of excruciating waits for email responses and an patchy provision of services. These problems appear to be caused in part by a major rise in demand on the service, and its small number of staff.
This view was echoed by the CUSU disabled students’ officer, Florence Oulds, who described DRC staff as being inundated by cases. She also suggested that colleges cause further complications, saying that it is “the luck of the draw” whether they were accommodating and understanding of disabled students’ needs.
Though the DRC performs well in terms of student satisfaction, with overall satisfaction placed at 85.9%, some students experience severe problems. Some praised their colleges, while others felt that colleges were not using DRC resources effectively.
Varsity’sanalysis of DRC statistics indicate the severity of its current struggles over staffing, caused by a rise in demand. The ratio of staff to disabled students, according to its 2016-17 annual report, stands at 1:503.
The report itself admits that this “represents a significant caseload”, with the most pressing issues for advisors being “the increase in volume of support demands and increase in cases which require significant advisory time.”
Problems with the DRC’s ability to cope with demand appear to be creating strain for students. The DRC’s automatic email response to new queries tells students that it could take up to three weeks to receive email responses, with some student testimonies mentioning an “expectation” of waiting between 4 and 6 weeks.
When approached for comment, the University Communications team said that they take “all concerns very seriously,” and aim to “review and improve services in response to feedback”. They claim to prioritise cases according to “urgent need,” and wrote that, “prioritising urgent cases sometimes mean others have to wait longer, particularly at peak times such as in the run up to examination access request deadlines.”
Oulds commended DRC staff, but described them as “overworked”. She is aware of slow response times: “it’s one of the most common things that students talk to [her] about.”
The DRC has also faced funding issues in recent years, as Government Disabled Students’ Allowances (DSAs) have undergone severe cuts. Previously, the DRC administered funding to students and claimed it back from the DSA. However, now the University relies increasingly on internal funds, although reduced DSA grants currently compose up to £500,000 of the DRC’s budget. There has been a silver lining to this: the DSA’s replacement by the Reasonable Adjustments Fund (RAF). The University provides the fund, and currently supports some 240 students. Harding described the funding as “sufficient,” with “no shortfall between the RAF and previous DSAs funding for non-medical help.”
The RAF has been praised by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as “an example of good practice.” Oulds praised the RAF for improving the DRC’s ability to provide students with grants quickly, with the previous wait of 3 months being cut to 3 days. Harding spoke positively of the changes, noting a 77% increase in take up of one-to-one study skills sessions.
Student testimonies indicated variation in the provision of services across colleges. One recounted how their Student Support Document (SSD), a record used to convey the specific academic needs of a student, was not updated by the DRC for use by their college, creating issues setting up special arrangements for their exams. Close to their exam period, it added “substantial stress to an already stressful time.” They understood that “the assumption was that [they] must have failed to provide the appropriate updates to the appropriate people,” despite having followed the correct procedures, and were made to feel it was their fault “that the correct arrangements weren’t in place.”
Another testimony echoed this, stating that their new director of studies had not received their SSD. However, the student said that, in this case the fault lay with their college – whom they suggested were not using the documents the DRC provided. Their tutor confessed to not having “studied [the SSD] in detail.” The student found this “disheartening,” hoping the SSD would give them “more confidence to study [in Cambridge.]” A lack of communication between their college and the Centre when organising exam arrangements led to a frustrating period of back-and-forth meetings. The situation was only resolved when a member of DRC staff spoke directly to the college and discovered that there would be no issue with the arrangements they had suggested – despite what the student had been told by the college previously. The student felt “betrayed and dismayed that college seem to be ignoring the advice of the DRC.”
Another student found that despite DRC attempts to train academic staff, there is a “lack of consistent education,” adding: “it is very much person-to-person the extent people go to help you and the understanding they have.” The DRC trained over 350 members of staff on disability support in the year 2016-17, an increase on the previous year’s 292. They also produce best practice documents and online resources. Nevertheless, this does not encompass the entire staff body, and some students continue to feel unsupported.
Virtually all of the testimonies gathered byVarsitypraised DRC staff. One said, “for what it’s worth, I do think the DRC are great,” despite them being “inundated.” Another called their disability advisors “expedient and helpful,” and were “grateful to the hard working people at the DRC,” regardless of detrimental “underfunding and understaffing.”

Dramatic rise in students disclosing mental health conditions
Florence Oulds also praised the DRC’s provisions when put in place: particularly their short-notice disability screenings. There is no DRC waiting list for specialist mentors and specialist 1-1 study skills tutors, although specialised learning difficulty advisers have a waiting list of 10-15 days, which the centre claimed have been affected by staff illness.
Regarding future improvements in the DRC’s services, Florence Oulds notes that it has staff specialising in a wide range of disabilities, and would like to see more with these capabilities. She would also like better implementation of reasonable adjustments to students’ study and exam conditions - referencing some students who feel that they must “fight for their adjustments,” despite it being a “legal right”.
When contacted, the University stated that “staffing levels are reflective of those across the sector” and emphasised that “student satisfaction levels are reflective of the excellent experience that the majority of students have when engaging with this service.” However,Varsity’stestimonials demonstrate a sense among some students that it is possible to fall through the cracks.

Kinshasa –The burden of repeated outbreaks of infectious diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – such as Ebola, yellow fever and cholera – are major public health problems for the Congolese people and a threat to regional health security.
With a focus on prevention, Japan’s Ambassador to the DRC in collaboration with IOM, the UN Migration Agency, inaugurated a new health centre (30/01) built in Lufu, Kongo Central province on the border between DRC and Angola.
The structure – built with support from the Government of Japan for USD 525,000 – will enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health to prevent, detect, and respond to epidemics and other public health emergencies in the border space. This achievement is
part of the support that the Government of Japan and IOM provide to the DRC in order to comply with the standards of the International Health Regulation (2005).
Indeed, the DRC shares more than 10,000 km of border with nine countries where large volumes of migration flows are observed, factors which contribute significantly to each country’s risk of cross-border transmission of disease.
In his address, Ambassador of Japan to the DRC Hiroshi Karube stressed the importance of 'strengthening the health system' at the 'border' level by referring to the recent outbreaks of yellow fever and cholera that have spread between DRC and Angola. With this in mind, Japan reiterated its commitment to supporting local initiatives supporting national efforts in the field of health.
"Japan remains a privileged partner of IOM, particularly on migration issues and dealing with health issues in border areas," said IOM DRC’s Mamadou Ngom.
A representative of the National Ministry of Public Health warmly thanked the Government of Japan for supporting the building of this health centre in the border area with Angola, which will contribute to the primary health of the people as well as to the fight against the spread of infectious diseases.
They also reminded those gathered that this first medical centre on the border aims to "ensure the application of the International Health Regulations but also the care of populations regardless of race and ethnicity."
In July 2016, the Government of Japan, through several institutions including IOM, extended emergency aid amounting to 3.5million US dollars for the DRC and Angola to fight against the yellow fever epidemic. This health centre reinforces Japan's commitment to the fight against the spread of transboundary infectious diseases.

Title: Bankers Cobalt Corp. Announces Agreement to Acquire
February 02, 2018 03:05 ET| Source:Bankers Cobalt CorpBankers Cobalt Corp
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  02, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Bankers Cobalt Corp.(TSXV:BANC) (the “Corporation” or “Bankers”) announces that it has entered into an agreement to earn up to a 70% interest in six additional concessions in the southern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Copperbelt. Bankers now has a total of 26 concessions with potential for cobalt and copper in the DRC with a total area of more than 391 km². Bankers has one of the largest DRC cobalt and copper exploration land packages held by a junior mining company.
The concessions are all located in the southern DRC Copperbelt. Five of the concessions are located north of Kambove and northeast of the Tenke Fungurume operating copper and cobalt mine. One of the concessions is west of Malambwe in the general vicinity of Bankers Kankutu project. The six concessions contain 110 carrés, totaling 92.4 km² in area. These six concessions were obtained from the same high-quality DRC partner as the six concessions announced in Bankers’ news release of January 4, 2018. Bankers appreciates our partner’s faith in our exploration team’s ability to assess and conduct exploration activities to world-class Canadian standards on multiple concessions at the same time.
Kevin Torudag, the President of Bankers’ DRC subsidiary stated, “Competition for quality concessions in the DRC Copperbelt is increasing. Companies appear to be coming to the realization that if you want to be a contender in the global cobalt sector, your company must consider acquiring suitable projects in the southern DRC Copperbelt. Bankers has a superior portfolio of concessions and these concessions were acquired at a substantially lower cost than the price per concession new entrants in the DRC will be forced to pay, if they can find a quality project within the dwindling available concessions. Bankers will continue to assess and acquire additional concessions on a very selective basis. Bankers will assess projects more advanced than our current portfolio and, in addition, will continue our efforts on exploration and development of our 391 km² land holdings.”
About Bankers
Bankers is a natural resource company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of cobalt and copper mineral properties in the DRC to world-class Canadian standards. This will address the supply chain custody and verifiable sources of ore issue being imposed on processors in the DRC by consumers. Bankers holds rights to 26 separate mineral concessions strategically located in the southern DRC Copperbelt with  a total area of more than 391 km². Bankers has the intention to acquire interests in additional concessions. All existing concessions were obtained as new grants or through reputable DRC partners and have clean title with no government involvement, making Bankers one of the few, and perhaps only, junior public mining company in the DRC to have 26 concessions capable of being currently explored and developed. Bankers has an experienced operations team in the southern Copperbelt of the DRC. Bankers believes it is one of the front-runners in advancing cobalt and copper exploration by a junior mining company in the DRC.
