Uganda, DRC sign pact to ease trade - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have agreed to remove non-tariff trade barriers in a bid to boost trade between the two African countries.
The agreement was reached during a Wednesday meeting attended by Uganda's trade minister Amelia Kyambadde and DRC's external trade minister Jean-Lucien Bussa Tongba in Uganda's Kasese. Kasese hosts one of the major border trade points between Uganda and DRC called Mpondwe.
A joint communique signed by the two ministers said the meeting had reached an agreement to also enhance management and control of standards and quality as well as exchange of information and statistics.
Last year, the DRC had banned the importation of certain products such as drinks from Uganda, prompting traders at the border district to complain.
Following the meeting, there is hope that more goods will be allowed to cross the border line.
"The two ministers considered and approved the list of products for the Simplified Trade Regime (STR)," the communique said. STR was recently implemented by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in a bid to help the small traders to benefit from the preferential rates enjoyed by commercial traders when importing or exporting goods within member states.
Uganda's exports to DRC reached 177 million U.S. dollars while it collects 2.5 million dollars from Congolese imports. Whereas Uganda exports lime and cement, iron and steel, cereals, vegetables and fruits, it brings in oils, cosmetics, iron and steel from DRC.
Last month, Uganda announced it had secured a loan from the World Bank to construct three modern markets across the border with DRC.
Uganda and DRC have in the past undertaken joint campaigns such as the fight against rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces.
Thousands of Congolese refugees have also found shelter in Uganda due to the ethnic clashes in eastern DRC.

DR Congo+ 1 more
Today, the U.S. government announced nearly $67 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the DRC Humanitarian Conference held in Geneva, Switzerland.
With the assistance announced today, the United States is providing food, protection, shelter, health care, and other urgent aid for vulnerable Congolese and refugees in the DRC. This funding is also supporting the humanitarian response for new Congolese refugees in the region, including the construction of new settlements, water infrastructure, logistics, and other life-saving assistance. While the United States is disappointed that the government of the DRC elected not to participate in today’s conference, we nevertheless urge the government of the DRC to continue working to ensure that life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches those in need.
The intensifying conflicts in the DRC since late 2016 have left more than 13 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 7.7 million people facing acute food insecurity. There are now 4.5 million Congolese displaced from their homes within the country—double the number displaced at the beginning of 2017. Countries neighboring the DRC host some 700,000 Congolese refugees, including more than 50,000 who have fled so far in 2018.
The DRC is at a critical juncture, with the opportunity for the country’s first ever peaceful, democratic transfer of power. While elections alone will not address the DRC’s many challenges, a credible electoral process that leads to a democratic transfer of power without violence is essential for securing a more prosperous and peaceful future for the DRC and its people.
The United States is the single largest donor to this humanitarian response. Since October 2016, the U.S. government has provided nearly $277 million in critical assistance to people in need in the DRC and for Congolese refugees in the region. We applaud the contributions of countries in the region that are hosting Congolese refugees, and the other donors who joined us in announcing new funding today. We urge more donors to provide new and additional resources to help those who are suffering in the midst of this terrible conflict and the DRC government to take steps to address underlying causes of insecurity that have given rise to the displacement and conflict and fueled the humanitarian crisis.

Botswana maintains pressure on DRC's Kabila - Xinhua | English.news.cn

GABORONE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's foreign affairs minister said on Thursday the country's new administration under President Mokgweetsi Masisi will not change its stance on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) until the country holds credible elections.
Vincent Seretse, Botswana's new Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation, told media in the capital Gaborone that the diamond rich Southern Africa nation will continue to reiterate her displeasure with DRC.
Botswana has taken step to directly criticize DRC President Joseph Kabila on his refusal to hold long overdue elections.
Seretse said the decision is driving deadly violence and a growing humanitarian emergency in the DRC.
"Botswana urges the international community to put more pressure on the leadership in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to relinquish power and pave way for the ushering in of a new political dispensation," said Seretse.
The newly appointed Seretse said the stance is in line with the country's foreign policy, adding that Botswana would continue to make her position known.
"We would wish DRC to reflect and hold elections. We want democracy to prevail in DRC," said Seretse.
Kabila has repeatedly postponed elections in what critics see as an attempt to retain power.
Meanwhile DRC is currently reeling under growing political unrest, some of it backed by the powerful Catholic Church.
The most recent round of protests saw some demonstrators killed by security forces and the arrests of several protesting clergymen.

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has tasked political stakeholders in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to ensure that elections slated for December this year are conducted in a conducive atmosphere.
Leaders of the southern Africa regional bloc met in the Angolan capital Luanda as part of the SADC Double Troika Summit of Heads of State and Government on 24th April 2018.
The DRC featured prominently in a communique issued at the end of the summit. Whiles calling for credible polls, it also announced that an envoy will be sent to the country as part of its efforts to help DRC through the elections and transition.
Other issued in the communique were the recent riots in Madagascar where the SADC is set to deploy ex-Mozambican leader Joaquim Chissano as an envoy and the situation in Lesotho after months of political and military tensions.
The body failed to state clearly a key sticking point which was to do with Kabila expressly stating that he was not going to contest. Kabila who personally attended was joined by five other presidents and in the case of Tanzania, vice-president Samia Suluhu represented Magufuli at the summit.
The parts that directly related to the DRC were as follows:
12. Summit noted the progress made in the implementation of the December 2016 Political Agreement, and in the electoral calendar in the DRC, for the Elections which are scheduled to take place on the 23rd of December 2018, and Summit commended the Government of the DRC, Political Stakeholders, and the National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) for the progress made.
13.Summit called on all stakeholders in the DRC to remain committed to the implementation of the electoral calendar and ensure a conducive environment for the holding of peaceful credible elections.
14.Summit further noted the substantive progress made in DRC and revisited its decision to deploy a SADC Special Envoy to the DRC, and expressed its appreciation to the Republic of Namibia and His Excellency Hifikepunye Pohamba, the former President of the Republic of Namibia, for his readiness and acceptance to serve as the SADC Special Envoy to the DRC.
15.Summit assured the DRC on its continued support to the electoral process and to the enhancement of political stability, peace and security.
