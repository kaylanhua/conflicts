India’s key stock indices surged about 1.5% to all-time closing highs on Friday led by banks as investors are now betting on the start of the reversal of the domestic interest rate cycle on the heels of the US Fed’s rate cut the first in four years earlier this week.
India’s top 10 private banks saw a net headcount addition of 295,000 professionals in the last four years with 94,046 jobs added in FY24, a 13% increase over FY23, which had the highest annual net additions at 106,753.
Indian investigative agencies pursuing absconding diamantaire Mehul Choksi, are seeking to get him back to India from Belgium, where he has been spotted, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The UK plans to abolish its 'non-dom' tax regime, causing concerns about a potential exodus of wealthy individuals. The change could result in nearly £1 billion in lost revenue instead of the predicted £3 billion boost. Some financiers are already moving to more tax-friendly countries like Dubai, Switzerland, or Italy.
The Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, plans to reduce immigration by cutting foreign student permits and tightening rules for temporary workers starting next year. This move aims to address the rapid growth of the temporary resident population and alleviate pressures on housing costs and public services.
Thailand's Tourism Minister, Sorawong Thienthong, plans to reintroduce a 300-baht tourism tax to boost revenue, targeting 3 trillion baht this year.

Title: Fleurette Group Press Statement: Fleurette Group Responds to Third Global Witness Statement on KCC Royalties
KINSHASA,Democratic Republic of the Congo,March 3, 2017/PRNewswire/ --
Fleurette Group ("Fleurette") notes the statement made by Global Witness, its third such statement in the pst few weeks regarding the sale of royalties from Katanga's KCC project by Gecamines to a Fleurette-owned entity, which again either misunderstands or ignores the basis economics of this deal which produced significant value for Gecamines and a loss to Fleurette. Once again, Fleurette is compelled to set the record straight and protect its reputation from Global Witness' false allegations.
Global Witness continues to seek to criticize Fleurette over the matter of disclosure. Fleurette always discloses anything that is obligated to disclose.
$3billionin tax revenues for the DRC
Fleurette finds it both regrettable that Global Witness did not see fit to offer any endorsement of the$3 billionin tax revenue paid by the Mutanda and KCC assets since Fleurette's initial involvement - both assets in which Fleurette was heavily invested but has now exited. Global Witness' claim that its interests are in "the importance of DRC's mining assets to its economy and the potential benefits from a well-run mining sector to the country's development" clearly don't extend to welcoming precisely that.
Questionable calculations by Global Witness
Fleurette has already identified a series of misleading errors, from the vindictive to the ignorant in Global Witness' coverage of the KCC royalties issue. These errors include:
Fleurette EITI Reporting
Fleurette confirms that all of its reporting to EITI is accurate and that GW is, once again, attempting to mislead and confuse and is misunderstanding the information at its disposal.
Fleurette's considerable loss
As Fleurette has already made clear publicly, the DRC made a net profit from the deal, Fleurette a net loss. The transaction ultimately resulted in Gecamines safeguarding value for the DRC economy and Fleurette making a considerable loss due to the subsequent collapse in commodity prices and suspension of KCC's operations. This is because Gecamines sold the royalty right before operations at KCC were suspended, meaning Fleurette had paid in full for a royalty stream that that ceased soon afterwards. While Fleurette was left unable to recoup its investment, Gecamines received full value for it.
Katanga has been a poor investment for Fleurette. As disclosed on13th February 2017, with the sale of its equity stake in Katanga, Fleurette has realised a loss of$190 million, in addition to the loss of the royalty deal. Yet these losses are never referred to by Global Witness, who seem determined to perpetuate the myth that Fleurette is able to generate positive returns on all its investments. This is evidently not the case.
Gecamines'Historic Loan
As has already been disclosed by Fleurette, Gecamines was provided with a$196millionloan from Fleurette, which has been paid back in full.Global Witness have once again misunderstood and misinterpreted information in front of them. Gecamines gave payment directions to KCC to make the payments due to it direct to AHIL in partial-satisfaction of the historic loan. There is no question of anything "misleading". It is disappointing that Global Witness consistently choose to jump to conclusions and guess historic narratives rather than accept the veracity of previous transactions involving Fleurette, Gecamines and Glencore.
Global Witness continues to ignore these facts. Instead, it attempts to crititicize a deal which demonstrably and unequivocally benefited both Gecamines and the DRC. Despite these continued unjustified attacks, Fleurette remains committed to investing in the DRC.
About Fleurette -www.fleurettegroup.com/ LinkedIn / Twitter
The Fleurette Group of Companies ("Fleurette") is an entrepreneurial business with significant investment in diverse sectors, including natural resources, infrastructure, agriculture and technology. Fleurette has substantial investments and operations in theDemocratic Republic of Congo(DRC). The parent company of the group, Fleurette Properties Limited, is owned by Line Trust Corporation Limited strictly and solely as trustees of the Ashdale Settlement, a trust established in 2006 for the benefit of the family ofDan Gertler. Mr Gertler is a citizen and resident ofIsraeland the DRC (and honorary counsel to the DRC) and is committed to developing the country's natural resources and infrastructure, while investing in the Congolese people and their communities.
Fleurette has a proven track record of successful co-operation with diverse parties, including the DRC State-owned mining company Gécamines, and to date has brought more than USD $7billion of investment into the DRC, on top of its USD$2 billionin private investment. As a result, Fleurette's subsidiaries and partnerships support around 30,000 jobs in the DRC and are amongst the DRC's leading taxpayers, contributing significant revenues to the State.
Fleurette is also a major contributor to social development in the DRC through the Gertler Family Foundation (GFF) and through direct investment in social infrastructure. The GFF is the largest charitable organization in the DRC, funding more than 50 programs and projects across the DRC, which help tens of thousands of Congolese every year. These include rebuilding key hospitals, notably the Kisangini "Hospital du Cinquantenaire"; supporting the Operation Smile campaign in Lubumbashi andKinshasa; rebuildingBlaise Pascal Schoolin Lubumbashi; and supporting the Lubumbashi Zoo.

He also lauded the efforts of DRC members in resolution of disputes effectively and without any expenses.DRC Chairman Tehreemul Haq briefed the IGP about the status of pending and settled cases on the occasion.

Title: DRC court sentences 9 rebels to death over killings | News24
Sunday, 22 September
10 Mar 2017
Beni - A Congolese court on Friday sentenced to death nine rebels and acquitted two others as the government seeks to hold a rebel group accountable for attacks that have killed more than 1 000 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo since October 2014.
The convicted were prosecuted for crimes against humanity, terrorism and participation in a rebellion, presiding judge Lt. Col. Jean-Paulin Esosa Basema said.
They are members of the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group founded in neighboring Uganda that is now based in DRC.
A third defendant was transferred to a court for minors, the judge said.
The trial of more than 100 defendants began in December.
Beni residents said they were satisfied with the first sentencings in the trial, and they said they hope it brings further international intervention against the violence in the region.
The ADF rebels are among scores of armed groups vying for control in mineral-rich eastern DRC.
The ADF rebel movement has been active since the 1990s but intensified its attacks inside DRC several years ago.
The president of the local human rights group, Omar Kavota, said that while he welcomed the trial and the great consideration given to the convictions, he did not welcome the death sentences.
