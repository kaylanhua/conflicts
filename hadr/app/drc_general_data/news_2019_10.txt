Uganda, DR Congo experts meet to assess progress in Ebola fight - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KAMPALA, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Health experts from Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), World Health Organization (WHO) and African Union (AU) on Monday started a meeting to assess the progress on Ebola response.
The health ministers from Uganda, DRC, WHO country representatives and AU experts are converging in the eastern DRC town of Goma to assess the progress and recommendations made in previous cross-border meetings aimed to combat the deadly virus.
Uganda's delegation is led by Ruth Aceng, the country's health minister and Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO country representative.
"The meeting provides an opportunity to assess the progress on response and recommendation made in the previous cross-border meetings," said Aceng in a statement issued here on Monday.
"We are looking forward to having fruitful discussion to address this PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern," said Woldemariam.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in July declared the Ebola virus disease, which has claimed over 2,000 lives in DRC, as a PHEIC.
In June, Uganda, DRC government officials and health experts met to share information on how to tackle and stop the spread of the deadly virus in the western border district of Kasese.
The African Union in July authorized the immediate deployment of an AU Mission Against Ebola in DRC.

Title: Search operation at An-72 crash site in DRC continues - Russian embassy -  Society & Culture - TASS
RABAT, October 13. /TASS/. A search operation at the crash site of the Antonov An-72 cargo plane in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues, despite the difficult conditions, Natalia Kononova, a spokesperson for the Russian embassy in the DRC, told TASS on Sunday.
"The search operation at the crash site continues. The operation is very difficult because the plane crashed in the jungles. As soon as the DRC authorities inform us about the operation’s results we will make public this information on our official accounts in social networks and will inform the families," she said.
"We cannot confirm reports that there were more than two Russian nationals aboard the crashed An-72. We don’t possess such information," she added.
The Russia embassy earlier confirmed that there were two Russians aboard the plane. "No other Russians were onboard," it stressed.
The Antonov-72 cargo plane of the DRC Air Force took off from the city of Goma in the country’s north, heading to the capital of Kinshasa. According to the DRC aviation authority, there were four crew along with civilian and military passengers, including members of DRC presidential staff. The passengers have not been yet identified. The plane lost contact with the control center 59 minutes after takeoff. No one has been found as of yet.

Title: How DRC's neighbours are coping with Ebola threat | Africanews

OTHER WIDGETS
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its nine neighbours on Tuesday agreed to strengthen cross-border collaboration in response to Ebola and other disease outbreaks.
For over a year now, DRC has struggled to contain an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 2,100 people, becoming the second largest in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.
DRC’s neighbours that include Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia have implemented several precautionary and reactionary measures as the virus extended towards their borders.
“Setting up a mechanism for cross-border collaboration and the sharing of assets will contribute to the mitigation of suffering and minimize the social and economic impact of disease outbreaks,” said H.E. Amira Elfadil Mohammed, African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs.
Authorities in Uganda have detected positive Ebola cases at their border points, while Rwanda, Tanzania and Malawi have been the subject of suspected Ebola cases.
In this article, we explore how DRC and its neighbours have responded to the Ebola threat, geographically.
The current Ebola outbreak, which is the tenth in DRC, was declared on 1 August 2018, in North Kivu. The outbreak has since spread to the Ituri province in the North, and southwards to South Kivu.
Cases have been recorded in the major cities of Beni, Butembo and Goma. Beni and Butembo are approximately 100km from the Ugandan border, while Goma borders Rwanda and is seen as a regional and international gateway.
“It is a good thing for the DRC to formalize a framework for collaboration and adopt a road map with its neighbouring countries on Ebola preparedness and response. In this way, we will be able to pull our resources together to strengthen health security and safety,” DRC’s deputy health minister Dr Albert Biyombo said on Tuesday.
The WHO, which has expressed concern about the widening geographic reach of the disease within the DRC, declared the epidemic an international health emergency in July, after the first Ebola case was recorded in Goma.
While urging countries not to close borders or restrict trade, the global body warned that Rwanda, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda are the most at risk, while Central African Republic, Angola, Tanzania, Republic of Congo and Zambia are in a second tier.
In June this year, Uganda announced that it had detected three positive Ebola cases in its territory, representing the first cross-border cases since the outbreak started.
Authorities reacted quickly, isolating the cases and repatriating them to the DRC. A new case was detected in August, but no new cases have been recorded in Uganda since then.
Uganda, which has been praised by the WHO for containing the spread of the virus, has implemented a massive vaccination campaign, as part of its preventive and precautionary measures.
When the Ebola virus spread to Goma, authorities in Rwanda reacted quickly, intensifying screening at ports of entry and asking citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to DRC.
Goma lies just 7 km from Rwanda’s main border town of Gisenyi, and immigration officials say up to 45,000 people go through the main border post between the two countries per day.
The country in July dismissed WHO reports suggesting that a trader who had died of Ebola in DRC had done business in Uganda and Rwanda.
“There is no Ebola in Rwanda as far as we are concerned. We have a strong surveillance system in place that helps us to prevent its entry,” Malic Kayumba, Head of Communications at Rwanda Biomedical Centre told The EastAfrican at the time.
Rwanda has never had a recorded case of Ebola and has trained over 23,000 medical personnel, police officers and volunteers in preparation to fight outbreaks.
Authorities in Tanzania were in September criticised by WHO and the United States for not sharing critical information over suspected Ebola cases in the country.
Tanzania’s health ministry insisted it was not obliged to share the negative results of two suspected cases it had investigated in the country. The United States and United Kingdom issued travel advisories as a result.
In Tuesday’s cross-border collaboration meeting, DRC and its neighbours noted that ‘‘withholding or falsifying information and data on Ebola violates the International Health Regulations and threatens the entire continent’‘.
‘‘Information sharing is improving, but we need to bring it to an acceptable level. We need countries to openly share information necessary to save lives,’‘ said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa.
This month, Malawi dismissed reports of a first Ebola case in the country, following the isolation of a traveler from Tanzania who had signs and symptoms of the virus.
“This is to inform the general public that there’s a patient admitted to Karonga Treatment Camp with fever and signs of infection,” read part of statement issued by the country’s health ministry.
Authorities clarified that a bacterial infection, and not Ebola had triggered the symptoms adding that “there is no history suggesting contact or travel to any region with Ebola.”
Malawi has peacekeepers deployed in DRC, and authorities say hundreds of people enter the country from the Ebola-hit country every month.
Authorities in Burundi in August stepped up surveillance and health controls, following the spread of the virus to the South Kivu province.
Health workers working along the shared border with DRC have also been vaccinated.
DRC, its neighbours, the WHO and the African Union (AU) are keen to ensure that the Ebola epidemic does not negatively affect movement of goods and persons across the region, and the entire continent.
“As the African Union advances towards implementation of Agenda 2063, which aspires for the political and economic integration of Africa, we need to be prepared for the risks that this change poses to the continent,’‘ H.E. Amira Elfadil Mohammed, African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs said on Tuesday.
A task force to coordinate the continent’s response to Ebola and other health outbreaks is to be hosted at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.

Title: 
	Was it the right decision to introduce a second vaccine in the DRC Ebola outbreak?

For more than a year, only Merck’s investigational V920 vaccine was used in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC. The vaccine, which has been shown to be more than 97% effective, can be used as both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. In September, WHO confirmed that a second vaccine would be used to help prevent further spread of the virus.Infectious Disease NewsaskedDaniel R. Lucey, MD, MPH,adjunct professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University, if introducing the second vaccine was the right decision.
Yes, the right decision by the DRC leadership fighting the ongoing Ebola outbreak was announced Sept. 23 by WHO. It stated that a second investigational Ebola vaccine, manufactured by Johnson & Johnson–owned Janssen, would be introduced in “at-risk populations that do not have active Ebola transmission” in the DRC in mid-October. They did not state whether this study will be a phase 2 trial or a phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial. If a phase 3 trial, it is unclear what the comparison arm(s) will be.
Appropriately, this announcement followed the initial 7-point announcement on Sept. 20 from the DRC technical secretariat headed by the renowned DRC Ebola expert, Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, in their daily Multisectoral Committee of the Ebola Response (CMRE) update on the epidemic. This second investigational vaccine will be offered to volunteers before any exposure to the Ebola virus, and its implementation will follow DRC ethics committee approval and informed consent. It should be emphasized that this J&J vaccine is not being proposed for use in a post-exposure setting or for contacts of patients with Ebola, the way that the first investigational vaccine, manufactured by Merck, has been used in the DRC since 2018. It is wise of the DRC leadership to define these clear differences between use of the two vaccines in order to avoid confusion about the vaccines among the multiple communities in the DRC.
A crucial difference between the two vaccines is that the J&J vaccine requires two non-identical shots 56 days apart, whereas the Merck vaccine only requires one shot. Thus, it is clear why the J&J vaccine is not being given to contacts of persons with Ebola, a virus with an incubation period of 2 to 21 days. Of note, the first dose of the J&J vaccine includes an adenovirus vector and a glycoprotein antigen only from Ebola Zaire, the species causing the outbreak. The second dose 56 days later includes an MVA vector and several filovirus protein antigens from Ebola (Zaire, Sudan and Tai Forest), as well as from the Marburg virus.
Before the J&J vaccine trial starts, two key issues are worth considering: 1) this vaccine does not contain any antigens from the Ebola Bundibugyo species of the virus; and 2) this vaccine has never been in a phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial in humans, and even the ongoing trial in Uganda of this vaccine is a single-arm phase 2 trial. Thus, from both a scientific and an informed consent perspective, these are important points of clarification with regard to the CMRE daily updates from Sept. 20 and Sept. 23, which indicated that the vaccine would protect against not only Ebola Zaire, but against other species of the virus, including Bundibugyo. Only a phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial in humans can prove any such protection by a vaccine.
Disclosure:Lucey reports no relevant financial disclosures.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its nine neighbours on Tuesday agreed to strengthen cross-border collaboration in response to Ebola and other disease outbreaks.
For over a year now, DRC has struggled to contain an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 2,100 people, becoming the second largest in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.
DRC’s neighbours that include Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia have implemented several precautionary and reactionary measures as the virus extended towards their borders.
“Setting up a mechanism for cross-border collaboration and the sharing of assets will contribute to the mitigation of suffering and minimize the social and economic impact of disease outbreaks,” said H.E. Amira Elfadil Mohammed, African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs.
Authorities in Uganda have detected positive Ebola cases at their border points, while Rwanda, Tanzania and Malawi have been the subject of suspected Ebola cases.
In this article, we explore how DRC and its neighbours have responded to the Ebola threat, geographically.
The current Ebola outbreak, which is the tenth in DRC, was declared on 1 August 2018, in North Kivu. The outbreak has since spread to the Ituri province in the North, and southwards to South Kivu.
Cases have been recorded in the major cities of Beni, Butembo and Goma. Beni and Butembo are approximately 100km from the Ugandan border, while Goma borders Rwanda and is seen as a regional and international gateway.
“It is a good thing for the DRC to formalize a framework for collaboration and adopt a road map with its neighbouring countries on Ebola preparedness and response.

DRC, its neighbours, the WHO and the African Union (AU) are keen to ensure that the Ebola epidemic does not negatively affect movement of goods and persons across the region, and the entire continent.
“As the African Union advances towards implementation of Agenda 2063, which aspires for the political and economic integration of Africa, we need to be prepared for the risks that this change poses to the continent,’‘ H.E. Amira Elfadil Mohammed, African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs said on Tuesday.
A task force to coordinate the continent’s response to Ebola and other health outbreaks is to be hosted at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its nine neighbours on Tuesday agreed to strengthen cross-border collaboration in response to Ebola and other disease outbreaks.
For over a year now, DRC has struggled to contain an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 2,100 people, becoming the second largest in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.
DRC’s neighbours that include Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia have implemented several precautionary and reactionary measures as the virus extended towards their borders.
“Setting up a mechanism for cross-border collaboration and the sharing of assets will contribute to the mitigation of suffering and minimize the social and economic impact of disease outbreaks,” said H.E. Amira Elfadil Mohammed, African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs.
Authorities in Uganda have detected positive Ebola cases at their border points, while Rwanda, Tanzania and Malawi have been the subject of suspected Ebola cases.
In this article, we explore how DRC and its neighbours have responded to the Ebola threat, geographically.
The current Ebola outbreak, which is the tenth in DRC, was declared on 1 August 2018, in North Kivu. The outbreak has since spread to the Ituri province in the North, and southwards to South Kivu.
Cases have been recorded in the major cities of Beni, Butembo and Goma. Beni and Butembo are approximately 100km from the Ugandan border, while Goma borders Rwanda and is seen as a regional and international gateway.
“It is a good thing for the DRC to formalize a framework for collaboration and adopt a road map with its neighbouring countries on Ebola preparedness and response. In this way, we will be able to pull our resources together to strengthen health security and safety,” DRC’s deputy health minister Dr Albert Biyombo said on Tuesday.
The WHO, which has expressed concern about the widening geographic reach of the disease within the DRC, declared the epidemic an international health emergency in July, after the first Ebola case was recorded in Goma.
While urging countries not to close borders or restrict trade, the global body warned that Rwanda, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda are the most at risk, while Central African Republic, Angola, Tanzania, Republic of Congo and Zambia are in a second tier.
In June this year, Uganda announced that it had detected three positive Ebola cases in its territory, representing the first cross-border cases since the outbreak started.
Authorities reacted quickly, isolating the cases and repatriating them to the DRC. A new case was detected in August, but no new cases have been recorded in Uganda since then.
Uganda, which has been praised by the WHO for containing the spread of the virus, has implemented a massive vaccination campaign, as part of its preventive and precautionary measures.
When the Ebola virus spread to Goma, authorities in Rwanda reacted quickly, intensifying screening at ports of entry and asking citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to DRC.
Goma lies just 7 km from Rwanda’s main border town of Gisenyi, and immigration officials say up to 45,000 people go through the main border post between the two countries per day.
The country in July dismissed WHO reports suggesting that a trader who had died of Ebola in DRC had done business in Uganda and Rwanda.
“There is no Ebola in Rwanda as far as we are concerned. We have a strong surveillance system in place that helps us to prevent its entry,” Malic Kayumba, Head of Communications at Rwanda Biomedical Centre told The EastAfrican at the time.
Rwanda has never had a recorded case of Ebola and has trained over 23,000 medical personnel, police officers and volunteers in preparation to fight outbreaks.
Authorities in Tanzania were in September criticised by WHO and the United States for not sharing critical information over suspected Ebola cases in the country.
Tanzania’s health ministry insisted it was not obliged to share the negative results of two suspected cases it had investigated in the country. The United States and United Kingdom issued travel advisories as a result.
In Tuesday’s cross-border collaboration meeting, DRC and its neighbours noted that ‘‘withholding or falsifying information and data on Ebola violates the International Health Regulations and threatens the entire continent’‘.
‘‘Information sharing is improving, but we need to bring it to an acceptable level. We need countries to openly share information necessary to save lives,’‘ said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa.
This month, Malawi dismissed reports of a first Ebola case in the country, following the isolation of a traveler from Tanzania who had signs and symptoms of the virus.
“This is to inform the general public that there’s a patient admitted to Karonga Treatment Camp with fever and signs of infection,” read part of statement issued by the country’s health ministry.
Authorities clarified that a bacterial infection, and not Ebola had triggered the symptoms adding that “there is no history suggesting contact or travel to any region with Ebola.”
Malawi has peacekeepers deployed in DRC, and authorities say hundreds of people enter the country from the Ebola-hit country every month.
Authorities in Burundi in August stepped up surveillance and health controls, following the spread of the virus to the South Kivu province.
Health workers working along the shared border with DRC have also been vaccinated.
DRC, its neighbours, the WHO and the African Union (AU) are keen to ensure that the Ebola epidemic does not negatively affect movement of goods and persons across the region, and the entire continent.

Title: Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian Snapshot (October 2019) - Democratic Republic of the Congo | ReliefWeb
DR Congo+ 10 more
Violence, conflict and hunger continue to drive displacement in the Great Lakes region. In May and June, more than 360,000 people were uprooted in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), bringing the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) country-wide to 4.8 million. Meanwhile, refugees from the broader region have continued to flee to Uganda, with more than 78,000 new arrivals from the DRC (nearly 47,100), South Sudan (more than 27,100), and Burundi (over 4,500) in 2019. In August, Burundi and Tanzania signed a bilateral agreement to accelerate the return of Burundian refugees. UNHCR has reiterated that any returns must be safe, dignified, voluntary and informed in line with the Tripartite Agreement previously signed between UNHCR, Tanzania and Burundi. Since September 2017, UNHCR has assisted in the voluntary return of more than 74,000 Burundian refugees.
There are now 17.8 million severely food insecure people in the region who need urgent assistance. Of these, 15.6 million people are in the DRC, where hunger continues to be driven primarily by conflict and displacement. In Uganda, harvests were 30 per cent below average, driving a rise in food insecurity, particularly in the Eastern region.
Alongside the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the DRC, the region is facing outbreaks of measles, cholera and malaria. By mid-October, over 3,200 EVD cases, including 2,150 deaths, had been reported in the DRC, while Uganda confirmed 4 cases in Kasese District in June (3) and August (1). In September, cases of an undiagnosed illness were reported in Tanzania. Nearly 205,000 cases of measles have been recorded across the region, including: more than 203,000 in the DRC, where more than 4,000 deaths have been reported, nearly all of them children; and almost 1,600 cases in Uganda, including six deaths. Cholera is also affecting the region, with nearly 21,000 cases and 374 deaths in the DRC and a new outbreak with over 400 cases in Burundi, mainly in Bujumbura. In Burundi, more than 6.2 million cases of malaria have been recorded in 2019, including over 2,300 deaths.

Title: Central African countries in talks on boosting anti-Ebola fight | Pulse Nigeria
Health ministers in 10 central African countries have held talks on boosting data sharing and cross-border surveillance in the fight against Ebola, the Democratic Republic of Congo announced Tuesday.
Health Minister Eteni Longondo and counterparts from the nine countries bordering the DRC met on Monday to swap views on "developing a framework for cross-border collaboration," the health ministry said.
The strategy aims at ensuring "timely sharing of critical information for rapid response and control of the epidemic... (and) strengthening cross-border health surveillance", it said in a statement.
The DRC's latest Ebola epidemic, the 10th in the country's history, has killed 2,171 people since August 2018, according to official figures.
It is the world's deadliest outbreak of the haemorrhagic virus after a pandemic in three West African countries that ran from 2014 to 2016 and claimed more than 11,300 lives.
On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the DRC epidemic remains a global "public health emergency," a status that ensures a heightened response from among WHO members.
The meeting of health ministers was organised in the eastern city of Goma in partnership with the WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a health arm of the African Union.
Representatives from Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia attended.
Of the DRC's neighbours, Uganda is the only one to have recorded cases of Ebola on its territory, registering four cases, but thousands of people cross the DRC's borders each day.

UN envoy calls for efforts to consolidate positive trends in DRC - Xinhua | English.news.cn

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) -- The top UN envoy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on Wednesday called for efforts to consolidate the new positive trends after the peaceful transition of power at the beginning of the year.
"New positive trends have emerged that might transform the DRC into a stable country," said Leila Zerrougui, the UN secretary-general's special representative for the DRC.
Regional diplomatic initiatives have been rolled out, a coalition government has been put in place with an ambitious program of action that is intended to stabilize the country, improve governance, and boost the level of economic development of the DRC, she told the UN Security Council via video teleconference from Britain.
It is now vital that the entire DRC political class supports these dynamics and works hard to consolidate these positive developments, she said.
Balance in the functioning of the institutions remains fragile and needs to be improved. And the United Nations is working closely with the president, with the government and with all the institutions of the DRC to promote stability and to ensure that the activities of UN agencies, funds, and programs are aligned with national priorities, said Zerrougui, who also heads the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC.

Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs
Refugees
Uganda continues to host the largest number of refugees in Africa, with over 1.34 million refugees and asylum-seekers within its borders, according to UNHCR and the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM).1 Over 848,200 are from South Sudan, 384,000 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 42,000 from Burundi and nearly 71,200 from Somalia, Rwanda, and other nearby countries. Sixty-one per cent of Uganda’s refugee population (over 812,000 people) are children. According to the OPM and UNHCR, a total of 6,700 new refugees arrived in Uganda in September from South Sudan, the DRC and Burundi. The average daily influx in September included 33 people from South Sudan and 192 from the DRC, compared to August arrivals of 26 and 191 respectively, with food insecurity being the main driver of movement from South Sudan and conflict being the main driver of movement from the DRC.
Disease Outbreaks
Ebola Outbreak: As of 30 September, there were no reported Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases or contacts under follow-up, and 7,945 frontline health workers and their contacts in 14 districts had been vaccinated against EVD. The latest EVD case was reported in Kasese district on 29 August 2019 involving a nine-year-old girl from the DRC who was detected during the routine screening at Mpondwe Point of Entry on 28 August. The child was brought by her mother to Uganda for healthcare. She tested positive for Ebola Zaire and died at Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) on 30 August 2019.
From 25-26 September 2019, a cross-border meeting between Uganda and the DRC was held in Kampala, with a focus on strengthening surveillance and coordination of point of entry activities. Some key recommendations included: the need for urgent review and finalization of the Health memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the DRC and Uganda; the development of a framework for management/repatriation of imported EVD cases; and the establishment of a one-stopborder point at Mpondwe. The National Task Force coordination sub-committee approved the organization of another crossborder meeting yet to be scheduled to strengthen risk communication and community engagement. The meeting will be conducted under the leadership of the district local governments of Kasese (Uganda) and Kasindi (the DRC), with support from the OPM, WHO, UNICEF Uganda County Office (UCO), and UNICEF DRC.
