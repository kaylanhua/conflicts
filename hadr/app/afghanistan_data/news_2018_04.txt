Title: Afghan Taliban Ready to Negotiate Amid Pakistan-Afghanistan Border Fighting
Why is the Pakistan-Afghanistan Border Tense and is the Afghan Taliban Really Ready to Negotiate with the US-Backed Government? While efforts were being made to carry out peace talks with the Taliban, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions rose on Sunday with killings of five Pakistan Soldiers. Will the current Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions disrupt the ongoing peace process?
Pakistan Asserting Force and Pressure on Taliban for Peace Negotiations
In an unexpected but pleasant turn of events, theAfghan Taliban extended their support to join the peace talks, as announced by a member of the HPC (High Peace Council). However, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border dispute broke out with the Kurram agency as an effort to disrupt the efforts to maintain bilateral ties between the two nations. However, both nations stepped up to make all efforts to maintain the Pakistan-Afghanistan border ties.
The HPC stated that Afghan Taliban had ‘somehow’ agreed to join the peace talks and that the council was ‘cautiously’ positive about it. A senior member stated, as reported inTOLO News:
“Inner pressure, as well as internal, regional and foreign support will finally push the Taliban to say yes to intra-Afghan talks. As per our information, discussions are ongoing among them (Taliban) and probably there might be some problems, but we are hopeful (about this process)”
The proposal to fence the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Chaman is slated to begin soon. Leaders of both nations have agreed to take all required measures to maintain the relations between the two countries, with the safety of the civilians at the border regions as the main priority. As reported inThe Tribune, both nations are committed to:
“effective actions against fugitives and the irreconcilable elements posing security threats to either of the two countries”
Additionally, cementing the Pakistan-Afghanistan border ties, both nations have decided to deny any nation, group, individual or network to use their territory for terror activities, and avoid aerial or territorial breaches on each other’s national territories.

Title: 'Taliban choosing to spread misinformation to create rift'- The Week
“The Taliban is involved in hit-and-run activity. They hit a certain place and then run across the border,” said Afghan Ambassador to India Shaida Mohammad Abdali. The Taliban—to which an unconditional offer of peace has been made—is now choosing to spread misinformation, and create rifts between regional and global actors in Afghanistan to prolong the war, he added.
The ambassador was speaking at an event organised by Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents in the national capital on Tuesday.
Drawing a distinction between Daesh in Afghanistan and in Iraq, Abdali said there was a “sophisticated campaign’’ to appropriate the label and prolong the war. “This Daesh vs Talib…There is a campaign to deceive our international partners and regional friends. The Daesh Afghanistan is made of Pakistan Taliban, and the locals across the Duran line.”
The Taliban has been offered an unconditional peace process, he said. So far, Afghanistan was still waiting for a response. “They are quiet,’’ he asserted. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is negative. They are pondering.”
Afghanistan had also seen an upsurge of 14 per cent of terrorist attacks in the last year. Taliban, in 2017, aimed at not only holding territory, but also two to four provinces. “They couldn’t achieve it,’’ he said.
Afghanistan was also in the midst of a big boost to its fighting air power. “The US has promised to triple the Afghan air force…Afghanistan was also modernising military equipment,’’ he said. And in the interim period, India was going to come to the rescue by helping Afghanistan acquire helicopters from Belarus.
Afghanistan was also “directly engaging with Pakistan’’, he said. There was two pronged approaches, in state-to-state engagement, and with regard to the Taliban to push the “insurgent group” to consider the offer of peace. “Unless we see results on the ground, we can’t say that they are supportive,’’ said Abdali, referring to Pakistan. “We continue to see violations across the border.

Title: Taliban won’t accept Pakistan’s ‘pressure’, says former Afghan envoy - Daily Times
Daily Times
Your right to knowMonday, September 23, 2024
Pakistan
* Mullah Zaeef believes Taliban do not want deal brokered by Pakistan and Iran
Tahir Khan
April 9, 2018

ISLAMABAD:Former Afghan ambassador in Islamabad Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef says Pakistan has ‘increased pressure’ on the Taliban to join the reconciliation process but the insurgents will not accept the pressure.
“Pakistan has increased pressure on the Taliban but they will not accept what Pakistan wants them to do. Pakistan has detained some senior Taliban leaders at a time when efforts are underway in the region to encourage the Taliban to come to the negotiating table,” Zaeef told Daily Times by the phone.
Pakistan is now committed to supporting the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation under Afghanistan – Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), which is a joint action plan for cooperation in key areas of counter-terrorism and for reduction of violence and promotion of peace and reconciliation, involving repatriation of refugees and joint economic development.
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi during his visit to Kabul on April 6 welcomed President Ashraf Ghani’s peace and reconciliation offer to the Taliban and both leaders called on them to respond positively to the peace offer and join the peace process without further delay.
“Taliban do not want any deal through any country, including Pakistan and Iran, but they want to solve the problems with the US without involvement of others,” Zaeef said.
Zaeef, who was the Afghan ambassador during Taliban government in Kabul, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and handed over to the United States months after American military toppled the Taliban government.
The United States had detained Zaeef at the Guantanamo Bay for some years, and finally set him free in 2005. He was put on the list of designated terrorists until 2010 and later he was excluded from it.
To a question why the Afghan Taliban were invited to peace negotiations by Kabul government, Zaeef said that the Taliban had not accepted the offer to join the political system as yet.
“So far, the Taliban consider the Kabul government an unconstitutional government. Secondly, the Taliban want to liberate Afghanistan from clutches of occupation forces. They want to introduce Islamic government in Afghanistan,” the former Taliban envoy said.
“I believe the Kabul government is not willing to understand objectives of the Taliban. Some Taliban leaders believe there is a conspiracy theory hidden behind recognition of the Taliban as a political power and, therefore, they do not accept this offer,” he said when asked about President Ghani’s offer to recognise them as a political party.
Ghani in his speech at the Kabul Process meeting on February 28 had offered the Taliban to open office in Afghanistan.
Responding to another question, Zaeef said that Pakistan was keen to see the Afghan Taliban joining the political system because Pakistan was facing serious allegations.
He categorically stated that the Taliban would not accept the demands of any country unless the foreign forces quit Afghanistan. He said that the United States was still engaged in creating problems for the Taliban and the people of Afghanistan and the region in several different ways. He said that the regional situation had deteriorated with the US invasion of Afghanistan.
Zaeef said the US should abandon stubbornness and give the Afghan war-affected stakeholders in Afghanistan an opportunity to resolve the issue on their own. “Washington should avoid making it an issue of pride and refrain from bringing further instability to the region in general and Afghanistan in particular, he said.

Title: The Regional Fallout From Trump’s Afghanistan Approach – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
President Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy means tough times for Afghanistan.
Donald Trump, in aninterview with theNew York Timesduring the campaign in 2016, articulated a desire to play his foreign policy cards close to his chest. “We need unpredictability,” he said and argued that an effective negotiator should be an enigma: no one is to know the bottom line and the ability to make a credible bluff is to be prized.
Now-President Trump reiterated the same thinking in August 2017 when heunveiled his new strategyfor winning the war in Afghanistan. He emphasized “how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options. … Conditions on the ground — not arbitrary timetables — will guide our strategy from now on.  America’s enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out.”
In the same speech he put forward a transactional approach to foreign policy when he said that India had made “billions of dollars in trade with the United States” and called on that country to do more in Afghanistan, “especially in the area of economic assistance and development.” The reference to India was puzzling since it is the most generous regional donor to Afghanistan, with $2 billion already provided and over $1 billion pledged in the coming years. However, the speech did make clear the president’s interest in upending traditional approaches to foreign policy and redefining national security in more purely economic terms, with allies (like India) as well as adversaries (like China) being asked to answer the question of “what have you done for us lately?”
In Afghanistan the uncertainty generated by the Trump policy has translated into a situation where there is no time line for an exit but there is urgency. Trump is interested in withdrawing troops from Afghanistan (where their presence is seen as costly and ultimately unproductive) and his military commanders are responding by moving quickly to consolidate the gains they have made and put in plans for “finishing the job.” The U.S. military is building up the strength of Afghan units with a re-energized air campaign and new advisory units emplaced with Afghan army battalions while the administration pushes for talks with the Taliban in order to bring a negotiated end to the conflict.
For the other actors in the region, there is no uncertainty about the bottom line.  The White House is looking for an exit and with the departure of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who authored Trump’s Afghanistan strategy, and the appointment of John Bolton, whose focus is on Iran and North Korea, the time line has shortened considerably. China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, and India — the other powers in the region — are responding to the uncertainties of the Trump administration policies by aligning their interests, recognizing the limitations of the Afghan government in Kabul, and exploring security options if the United States fully withdraws.
Aligning Interests
The defeat of the Islamic State in Syria and the exodus of fighters from the region into Afghanistan and Pakistan have led China, Iran, and Russia to recognize that they share a common concern about the growth of Islamist movements that have pledged allegiance to the caliphate of the Islamic State in their neighborhood.  The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), founded in 2014 and comprised of former members of the Taliban, al-Qaeda as well as Central Asian groups like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), has provided a foundation for realigning the interests of at least some of these regional powers.
China is dealing with a restive Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang, where a vicious government crackdown after 2009 led young Uyghurs to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in droves. Some of these young men have now returned to join the ISKP. China’s interest is also due to its $60 billion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has resulted in projects scattered across the region.
Not surprisingly Beijing recently signed a defense agreement with Afghanistan to build a base in northern Afghanistan and set up a trilateral contact group with Afghanistan and Pakistan to combat terrorism. China has made it clear that it will support Afghan government-led efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict with the Taliban – an approach which is supported by the United States. China’s influence on Pakistan is also considerable due to the investments it has made as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of the BRI. China is viewed as an honest neighbor with the ability to reach understandings with Russia, the United States, as well as Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
Iran and China share similar concerns about ISKP in the region. The two countries have close economic ties and in November 2016 signed a military cooperation agreement, which allows them to engage in military-to-military exchanges as well as joint counterterrorism training. Iran views the idea of an Islamic caliphate as a distortion of the faith and inimical to its interest in the region. The Islamic State attack on the Iranian parliament and the shrine of Khomeini last year served as a timely reminder of this threat.
Iran’s concern about ISIS can be seen in its move to cement relation with Pakistan, which it views as essential for any solution to the problems in Afghanistan. In the past this would have been difficult because Iran and India have traditionally worked together. However, as India has moved closer to the United States and Israel, Iran has begun to take on a more adversarial tone vis-à-vis India. This was evident in 2017 when Iran criticized Indian military actions in Kashmir (much to the delight of Pakistan) and rejected Trump’s call for greater Indian engagement in Afghanistan. Iran’s relations with Pakistan are not without problems, however. When Pakistan joined the 41 country Islamic Military Alliance (IMA) set up by Saudi Arabia, it had to reassure Iran that it was not joining an anti-Shia body and followed up by signing a counterterrorism pact with Iran to address the problems posed by the ISIS.
Russian concerns about ISKP have led it to work with China, Iran, as well as Pakistan to limit the growth of Islamist movements, which could spill into the five Central Asian republics on Russia’s southern flank. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan have joined Russia and China in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and conduct regular military and counterterrorism exercises with both. Russia is the dominant military partner for Central Asia while China takes the lead in economic activities – a division of labor that has worked to offset any tensions in the immediate future.
Russian concerns about the infiltration of ISKP into Afghanistan has also led to increased cooperation with Pakistan in recent years. As a result of the work done by the Russia Pakistan Joint Working Group, a Russian military delegation visited North Waziristan in the Pakistani tribal belt in March 2017, months after Russia and Pakistan conducted joint military drills. The seventh meeting of the JWG held in March this year ended with both countries expressing concern about the rising threat posed by ISIS. It is not surprising then that in February of this year, Moscow appointed an honorary consul in the city of Peshawar. The heightened cooperation between Russia and Pakistan is literally visible in the addition of Russian language signage in the tribal belt and even around Islamabad. This is coming at a time when the United States has blocked the release of military assistance funds to Pakistan pending certification that it has taken specific actions against the terror networks it is accused of harboring.
India is the odd man out in the aligning of interests in the region. It has a long and troubled relationship with both China and Pakistan and has fought wars with both. Its relations with Iran have become more difficult in recent years as it has deepened its relationship with the United States. However it is also one of the most financially invested regional powers in Afghanistan and is therefore critical for long term stability in the country. The Trump call for increased Indian involvement in Afghanistan led to greater tension between New Delhi and Islamabad, which often accuse each other of supporting the militants responsible for instability in that country. India’s admission (as a result of Russian intervention) to the SCO last year coincided with Pakistan’s admission (as a result of China’s intervention) and it is to be hoped that the inclusion of these two countries to an organization whose goals explicitly call on member states to coordinate activities against the three evils of terrorism, separatism, and extremism will help them identify common ground.
Recognizing the Limitations of the Afghan Government
China and Russia are concerned about the ability of the Afghan government to keep control of its territory and contain the Taliban as well as the Islamic State. They also recognize the importance of the role Pakistan must play in reigning in the militants who operate from within its borders. Both countries have adopted a two track policy: providing support for the Afghan government while trying to get Pakistan on board vis-a vis the Taliban.
China has tried to use its influence in both countries to increase cooperation between the two in order to promote effective counterterrorism mechanisms. The lack of success with these efforts has led China to pursue negotiating with the Taliban as a strategy and it was very supportive of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s call for the Taliban to come to the table earlier this year.
Russia for its part has involved itself in hosting multilateral talks on Afghanistan since 2016 when it parted ways with NATO on policy in Afghanistan. As these efforts have stalled it too has raised the possibility of negotiating with the Taliban. Moscow recently offered to host U.S. talks with the Taliban (banned as a terrorist group in Russia) just as U.S. military commanders accused it of arming the group. Russia and the Taliban reject these accusations and say that most of the weapons are flowing from stockpiles of the Afghan army and the police. If the claim is true, it is yet another sign of the limited strength of Afghan institutions.
Iran is the least invested in the Ghani government, which it sees as being weak and incapable of managing the ethnically diverse Afghan state. Iran continues to maintain links with powerful Tajik and Uzbek leaders who are not happy with the Ghani government. Tehran is accused of providing financial and military support for the Taliban, which Iran sees as a proxy to fight the rise of the ISKP while at the same time raising the costs of continued Western military intervention in Afghanistan. Iran has denied these charges but the death of Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in a 2016 drone strike in Balochistan as he was returning from a meeting with Iranian officials makes it difficult to believe the denials.
The weakness of the Afghan government has also led to problems with getting economic traction on projects that could turn the economy around. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline has been in the news this year because of the inauguration of the start of work on the Afghan portion of a pipeline, which is designed to bring much needed natural gas to South Asia. However, as with the UNOCAL project in the 1990s, security is the biggest concern even though the Taliban has promised to protect this line (like they did the earlier project). It is not clear who is going to pay the estimated $10 billion price tag given the security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and threats from other groups like al-Qaeda, ISKP, the Pakistani Taliban, and Baloch separatists among others.
The inability of the Afghan government to address security is having a negative impact on economic development and leading the major regional powers to look for other options to stabilize the region.
The Security Options in the Event of a U.S. Withdrawal
Neither China nor Russia want to take on the U.S. military role in Afghanistan. China is concerned enough to have signed an agreement in December last year to build a base in northern Afghanistan and provide assistance to the Afghan National Army by way of training and resources. However a larger role is unlikely; China is much more interested in the economic initiatives underway as part of the BRI and it has no desire to antagonize Russia, with whom it partners in the SCO.
Russia, for its part, has little interest in putting boots on the ground in Afghanistan after its 10 year experience in that country between 1979-1989. The most that can be expected is that Russia will continue to invest militarily in the Central Asian Republics in order to prevent problems in Afghanistan from spilling over into its neighborhood.
Iran is interested in seeing the United States leave the region but will limit its military commitment to adventurism of the sort we are seeing currently with its support for the Taliban. Grand Ayatollah Khamenei, in a speech on his website, recently accused the United States of helping to transfer Islamic States to Afghanistan and of being responsible for a rash of terrorist attacks in that country. While these are false accusations, they lay the groundwork for Iran to support efforts directed against the ISKP. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has helped create an Afghan Shi’ite militia (the Liwa Fatemiyoun) which has gained fighting experience in Syria. It is possible that, while ISKP does pose a threat inside Afghanistan, groups funded by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps activity might further destabilize the country in the future.
Pakistan and India have the least interest in seeing the United States leave the region. For Pakistan, the U.S. military presence is a source of revenue for both the Pakistani military and the larger economy and provides an additional safeguard against India. The uncertainty created by Trump’s complaints about Pakistan have simply made it even more likely that its support for groups like the Haqqani Network will not be disappearing any time soon. Funding the insurgents is guaranteed to keep Afghanistan destabilized – and hopefully keep the United States engaged in the region. India for its part sees the U.S. military presence as essential if it is to focus on economic development issues in Afghanistan. India will not put boots on the ground because it has its own failed experience with intervention in Sri Lanka in the 1980s and the geography of the region precludes an easy way to do this given the uneasy relationship with Pakistan and Iran.
The only viable regional mechanism for taking on security issues in Afghanistan post-U.S. departure is through the SCO, since all of the major regional powers are now in that organization. However, this is unlikely given the existing antagonisms between China and India or India and Pakistan, among others, as well as the fact that Afghanistan only has observer status in the group.
In the absence of better leadership in Kabul and at the regional level a U.S. withdrawal in the current climate could send Afghanistan into the kind of downward spiral that brought the Taliban to power in 1996.

Every year the military spends ba-zillions of dollars on R&D…..some of it is for new types body armor or a new rifle or a new vehicle….and then there are some research and development that just seems to be a waste of money…….found one!
The Pentagon is working on a funky new weapon that is, in the words of the estimablePopular Mechanics, “profoundly weird.” In short, military scientists aim to use lasers to create what sound like human voices that could be projected afar. These “voices” could then be used for “psychological operations, making announcements, or just plain weirding out the enemy,” writes Kyle Mizokami. The details of what’s called the Laser-Induced Plasma Effect come from a report atDefense One. One laser, called a femtolaser, creates a ball of plasma that’s hit by a second nanolaser. Tuned to a precise range of wavelengths, the laser manipulates the plasma to produce light and sound. Ina video, a noise a bit like human mumbling can be heard during a second test of the device. The Pentagon thinks it can produce intelligible words in about three years.
“We’rethisclose to getting it to speak to us,” says David Law of the Pentagon’s Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program. Asecond videoshows the weapon creating the sound of a stun grenade. But the plasma can also be manipulated to produce heat, as seen in one test that caused a military uniform to burn, reportsArs Technica. Potentially, this could be done from a distance of several miles, Law says, noting an 8-inch laser mirror would create the effect about three miles away. A person between the weapon and the target would be unaffected, he adds. Some other possible uses: warning (or frightening) people away from a military checkpoint or perhaps mimicking the sound of gunfire
Seriously?  It always amazes me to see just what the military will attempt to suck on the taxpayer teat.
My day is no more…..time for me to adjourn to the library for a good book and a snifter of brandy…..chuq
As a Viet Vet I am always having to have the conversation about that war….mostly with people that are too young to know what it was like or from older people that did not go and serve in the country.
Usually I shut down the conversation when I ask if they were in country……if they say no then I point out that how can they have any idea of what happened if they were not there?  That normally makes some upset and they storm off.
Some stay to show their savvy of that war…they read a book or saw a movie so they have a good grasp on the policies of the time…..
Of course the conversation turns to why the war was lost….there is a wide array of reason….but the one that got my attention was the one that believes that it was Congress fault for cutting off funding to South Vietnam……
This article points out the fiscal policy of the day to include the war in Vietnam.
Since partisans have turned the April 30, 1975, Communist takeover of South Vietnam into a political weapon, I’m going to spend the anniversary doing a little myth-busting.
Mel Laird, Richard Nixon’s defense secretary, started the modern myth that “Congress snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by cutting off funding for our ally in 1975” in a 2005articlein Foreign Affairs, the journal of the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations.
Laird repeated it two years later in a Washington Postop-ed columnin which he wrote “of 1975, when Congress cut off funding for the Vietnam War three years after our combat troops had left.”
https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/126150
We have a new president and a new number one problem in this country….with Trump it is the opioids abuse.
He has put Kelleyanne Conway as the Opioid Czar and her take on preventing the abuse is for addicts to eat ice cream or french fries…..a sound medical advice from another Trumpian that has NO clue about the world around them.
I read an article written in “The Cipher” on this problem…..
Americans are facing one of their deadliest foes in recent history: not ISIS, but opioids, painkillers that are highly addictive and killing thousands of Americans annually. Drug overdoses took the lives of 64,000 people in 2016, with two-thirds related to opioids.
Congress has taken a good first step, providing the federal government an additional $3.3 billion to fight the opioid crisis in its fiscal year 2018 spending bill with a focus on public health efforts. Most of the money, $1.4 billion, will go to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for a new State Opioid Response Grant program and also for the Mental Health Block Grant, according toVox. The second highest chunk of funding, $500 million, is for the National Institutes of Health for more opioid addiction research.
https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/expert-view/targeting-one-americas-deadliest-foes-opioids
Interesting thoughts from an agent of the DEA….I would like to hear from my readers on their ideas on the opioid abuse situation.
I agree that abuse is on the rise but on the same token opioids do good for people that suffer with chronic pain.
17 years and counting and in all that time not one word of how long this will continue to effect the country.
The Trump Pentagon is searching desperately for some success that they can hold up to the nation and claim that we are definitely winning this war.
As the US continues to escalate the war in Afghanistan, the official position is that there are no timetables anymore, no deadlines. 17+ years into the conflict, any pretense of a quick ending has long since evaporated.
That does not, however, mean that the Pentagon isn’t feeling pressure, as preposterous claims of “progress” ring as hollow today as they did in 2004, or 2013, or any other time in the war. The US may feel comfortable committing to decades more of the same, but NATO allies that keep getting dragged in for a new escalation are increasingly skeptical that there is a real endgame.
Pentagonleaders are desperate to show that something is different this time around, and that they aren’t just spinning their wheels in Afghanistan, even though that’s really what’s happening. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Joe Dunford insists that this year will be “fundamentally different” from the last 17 years of US war in Afghanistan.

Finding some success that could be taunted as a win is getting harder and harder o fine….and now the US has an old problem made new……
The Trump Administration is supportive of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s call for talks with the Taliban in order to bring peace to Afghanistan. Russia, Iran and China have also reached out to the group The interest in talking to the Taliban is partly the result of concerns about the Islamic State in Afghanistan.
Calling itselfWilayat Khorasan, the Islamic State’s South Asian branch is more commonly referred in Western media as ISIS-K or ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province). ISKP lays claim to an emirate comprising parts of Iran, three Central Asian republics, Afghanistan, Pakistan and in some maps parts of Kashmir in India and Xinjiang in western China. The group has sworn loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi even though most analysts agree that at least in the early years there was little or no connection between this group and the Islamic State in the Middle East.

Just when Trump is pushing the death of ISIS they are rearing their ugly mugs more and more in Afghanistan.
I want to see Trump address this rising problem and stop soft soaping the wars of intervention.

MOTHERS lining up with children to register to vote in local elections were targeted by a suicide bomber in Afghan capital Kabul, in an Islamic State attack that killed at least 57 people and injured another 100 more.
The sickening assault is the latest on voter registration centres in the embattled country to specifically target civilians, with the splinter Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) now combating both the President Ashraf Ghani’s government and the Taliban.
The large explosion was in the western suburb of Dasht-e Barchi, an area of western Kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority and about 18km from where coalition forces including the Australian Defence Force are based at Kabul International Airport.
Authorities have warned the death toll from the large blast, that shattered windows several kilometres away, was expected to rise in coming hours.
At least 21 women have so far been confirmed dead and five children but 65 more have been seriously injured.
The city went into virtual lock down after the blast with only emergency vehicles allowed into the impoverished district.
It was the deadliest blast in Kabul since about 100 people were killed in January by a bomb concealed in an ambulance and it came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the election process.
There had already been at least six other attacks on voter registration centres set up in school and community halls for elections to be held this October, with one just last week killing three police officers and wounding several civilians.
Within hours of the latest assault, the ISKP, which was formally proscribed as a terrorist group by the Australian parliament late last year, claimed responsibility.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said a bomber on foot approached the centre where officials were issuing identity cards as part of the registration process for around 10 million voters across Afghanistan.
President Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack and said it “cannot divert us from our aims or weaken this national democratic process”.
Parliament is still sitting three years after its term officially expired and further delays would seriously weaken already fragile confidence in the Afghan political system.

Title: Why Russia Exaggerates Islamic State’s Presence in Afghanistan – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
The notion that the United States is facilitating the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan resonates powerfully within Russia.
On February 20, 2018, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with his Pakistani counterpart Khawaja Muhammad Asif to discuss the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Afghanistan. In apress conferenceafter their meeting, Lavrov described the presence of ISIS in northern and eastern Afghanistan as “rather serious,” and alleged that there were thousands of ISIS gunmen operating across the war-torn country.
Lavrov’s statement on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan was widely criticized in the United States. In an interview with theBBCWorld Service,General John Nicholson, the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, argued that Russiahas exaggeratedthe ISIS threat in Afghanistan to justify its provisions of military assistance to the Taliban. Navy Captain Tom Gresback, the public affairs director at Resolute Support headquarters, also concurred with Nicholson’s assessment by claiming that there islittle evidencethat ISIS is expanding its military presence in Afghanistan.
Russia’s frequent exaggerations of the Islamic State’s presence in Afghanistan are closely intertwined with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s broader internal consolidation and foreign policy objectives. Russian policymakers have emphasized the ISIS threat to unite anti-Western nationalists around Russia’s expanded diplomatic involvement in Afghanistan, strengthen Moscow’s alliances with Central Asian countries, and establish common ground with Pakistan on the resolution of Afghanistan’s political crisis.
Since U.S. President Donald Trump authorized a MOAB (“mother of all bombs”) strike in April 2017 that killed 92 ISIS militants in Afghanistan, Russian officials have argued that U.S. policymakers have become complacent about the Islamic State’s ability to threaten regional stability. To highlight this perceived policy failure, Russia’s special envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulovreleased a statementin December 2017 that praised Russia for being one the first countries to label ISIS as a major security challenge, and claimed that over 10,000 ISIS militants were present in Afghanistan, with many arriving from Syria and Iraq.
Even though Kabulov downgraded his estimate to 7,000 fighters on February 1, the narrative that Washington has not adequately responded to the Islamic State’s rise remains at the forefront of Russian official rhetoric on Afghanistan. In late February, Lavrov reiterated Kabulov’s concerns about ISIS fighters migrating from the Middle East to Afghanistan, and decried NATO’s failure to devote adequate resources to defeating this threat.
Even though Lavrov has struggled to sell the case for a rising ISIS threat to U.S. policymakers, the notion that the United States is facilitating the rise of ISIS in Afghanistan resonates powerfully within Russia. Quoting statements from Iranian military officials and Afghan policymakers, Russian state media outletSputnikhasprominently featuredallegations that the United States is supporting ISIS in Afghanistan to weaken the Taliban’s influence in the country. As these conspiracy theories are gaining broader acceptance in Russia, highlighting the ISIS threat ensures that anti-Western policymakers accept the need for an expanded Russian diplomatic role in Afghanistan.
In addition to bolstering internal support for the revival of Russia’s diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, Russia has focused on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan to establish more mutually beneficial alliances with its Central Asian partners. This strategy has reaped dividends, as Central Asian countries view ISIS as a legitimate security threat and a highly visible nemesis to rally public support against. Although Kyrgyzstan was noncommittal about assisting Russia’s military intervention in Syria, it has cooperated closely with Moscow against the ISIS threat from Afghanistan. The Kyrgyz military has also been active participant in Russian-led military drills aimed at increasing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)’s preparedness against the threat of ISIS in Afghanistan.
Even though Russian officials have historically chastised Tajikistan for its ineffective border security policies, Moscow’s emphasis on the ISIS threat in Afghanistan has created a sense of urgency in Dushanbe that has enhanced Russia-Tajikistan security cooperation. In recent months, Tajikistan hasallegedly assistedMoscow’s supplies of light weaponry to the Taliban’s anti-ISIS operations, and facilitated Russia’s pre-emptive defensive measures against ISIS byacting as a conduitfor the movement of Russian armored vehicles to Afghanistan’s frontiers.
Russia views these displays of support against ISIS as encouraging, because they allow Moscow to frame itself as a benevolent protector of Central Asian countries against terrorism rather than as a hegemonic actor. As many Central Asian governments continue to view the securitization of Islamic extremism as a useful tool for regime consolidation, Moscow is likely to be able to use its anti-ISIS efforts in Afghanistan to bolster the effectiveness of its regional alliances.
The Russian government’s successful engagement of its Central Asian partners against the ISIS threat in Afghanistan has encouraged Kremlin officials to focus on ISIS during their diplomatic negotiations with Pakistan. While joint pledges from Islamabad and Moscow to combat ISIS have been largely rhetorical in nature, Russian policymakers have been cautiously optimistic that increased dialogue on combatting ISIS will result in more extensive bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.
On March 21, Russia held a Joint Working Group (JWG) on counterterrorism with Pakistan at the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad. After this JWG, officials from both countries described thethreat of ISISin Afghanistan as a “grave concern,” and argued that the diffusion of foreign fighters from Iraq and Syria to South Asia was a major threat to regional stability.
Despite the lack of evidence for a rising ISIS presence in Afghanistan, Pakistani officials have shared Russia’s focus on ISIS in Afghanistan, because Islamic State’s rise is a symbol of the ineffectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism strategies in South Asia. As Pakistan continues to face international scrutiny for its links to the Taliban and Haqqani Network, Russia’s strategy of blaming Washington for the poor security situation in Afghanistanis appealingto Pakistani policymakers, and could cause collaboration against ISIS to act as a stepping stone for a more comprehensive Russia-Pakistan security partnership.
Even though ISIS appears to be a declining force in Afghanistan, Russian officials have exaggerated its presence to gain domestic support for Moscow’s diplomatic initiatives in Afghanistan, upgrade its alliances with Central Asian countries, and strengthen Russia’s burgeoning partnership with Pakistan. The success of this strategy ensures that Russia will continue to frame its involvement in Afghanistan around combatting the receding threat of ISIS for the foreseeable future.

	      US Airstrike Kills ISIS Commander, Bodyguard In Afghanistan | 
	  The Daily Caller

The Department of Defense released details — and video — of an April 5 airstrike that killed top Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) commander Qari Hikmatullah and his bodyguard in northern Afghanistan.
According to a story published on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), Hikmatullah was a “senior ISIS-K commander and the main facilitator of ISIS-K fighters in northern Afghanistan.”
Hikmatullah, originally from Uzbekistan, was largely responsible for bringing in foreign fighters and lethal aid into Afghanistan. Before joining ISIS-K, Hikmatullah was part of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and then pledged his allegiance to the Taliban.

In his place ISIS-K has promoted Mawlavi Habibul Rahman, also from Uzbekistan, to take Hikmatullah’s place. Rahman has a history of mixed allegiances and several ISIS-K leaders in northern Afghanistan are displeased with the appointment.
The DOD says that their counterterrorism operations in the Jowzjan Province have left ISIS-K with few options for leadership.
WATCH:
In March 2018, the U.S. eliminated another ISIS-K leader as well as several fighters in separate strikes throughout Afghanistan. In January 2018, Hikmatullah’s predecessor was captured by Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF) during a raid.
This latest strike is part of the broader South Asia Strategy President Trump announced in August of 2017. Under the new strategy, written by Secretary of Defense James Mattis, U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan are conducting more counterterrorism operations with Afghan Special Security Forces, while simultaneously training the Afghan National Army (ANA) to operate independently and effectively.
In February, the U.S. Army’s First Security Force Assistance Brigade deployed to Afghanistan and took responsibility for training the ANA. Their deployment frees up U.S. Special Operations Forces units to work more closely with ASSF.

Readers,
Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.
Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and
joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes
to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business;
senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want
to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our
independence.
We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our
hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account.
Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates
them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of
our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
Help us save her.
A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have
trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political
spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily
Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News,
Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a
fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office.
And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible
to ignore.
We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you —
the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians,
corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new
generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there
are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that
we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need
revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent
we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and
lightning fast website you deserve.
Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters
and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
We can save America together.
Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.

Bryan Llenas has the story for 'Special Report.'
U.S. military aircraft dropped more bombs in Afghanistan last month than against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to a new Air Force strikereportfrom its Central Command headquarters in the Middle East, a sign the war against ISIS is winding down.
In March, U.S. jets and drones fired roughly 350 bombs and other munitions against the Taliban and an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in Iraq and Syria, the U.S. military dropped around 300 bombs against the last remnants of ISIS, as the terror army moves underground after losing tens of thousands of fighters.
The number of bombs dropped against ISIS in Iraq and Syria last month was the fewest recorded since airstrikes began in August 2014. In comparison, the U.S. dropped more than 5,000 bombs in August 2017 against ISIS in Iraq and Syria making the March 2018 total just 5 percent of the month’s peak less than a year ago.
THREAT OF FOREIGN TERRORISTS MORE GLOBAL THAN EVER, REPORT FINDS
U.S. officials claim most of the ISIS-affiliated fighters in Afghanistan are mostly Pakistani Taliban, who have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State, but are not receiving a great deal of material or monetary support from the group’s leaders.
Last week, American, French and British forces launched 105 missiles against three of Assad’s chemical weapons facilities in Syria following an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus by the regime which killed more than 40 civilians, including women and children.  But the Pentagon says the mission in Syria remained the war against ISIS.
Tuesday, an American military spokesman warned ISIS had shown signs of life in areas controlled by the Assad regime and their Russian and Iranian backers.
U.S. warns more airstrikes on Syria are possible. On 'America's Newsroom,' State Department spokeswoman says the U.S. has seen a series of Russian lies at the United Nations.
“In the pro-regime area west of the Euphrates River, we have seen a resurgence or rather some ISIS elements coming back and attacking with success,” said U.S. Army Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition “There has been ISIS elements who have been able to come back and take territory as I mentioned some of the neighborhoods in southern Damascus.”
Col. Dillon refused to estimate how many ISIS fighters remain.

US kills top ISIS terror leader in Afghanistan airstrike | American Military News









A U.S. airstrike killed the senior ISIS-K commander in Afghanistan last week, according to apress releasefrom U.S. Forces-Afghanistan.
Qari Hikmatullah and his bodyguard were killed in the U.S. airstrike in Bal Chiragh district, Faryab province, Afghanistan, on April 5.
Gen. John Nicholson, Commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, said the joint operation was carried out by American Special Operations Forces troops and Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF).
“ASSF and U.S. counterterrorism forces killed Hikmatullah and they will kill any successors,” Nicholson said.“ISIS-K will be eliminated.”
US Forces Afghanistan (Twitter)
Hikmatullah was the main facilitator of ISIS-K fighters into northern Afghanistan prior to his death.
“ISIS-K in Jowzjan province is the main conduit for external support and foreign fighters from central Asian states into Afghanistan.,” according to the release. “Hikmatullah was the key leader for those operations.”
Brig. Gen. Mohammad RadmanishsaidHikmatullah was tracked by Afghan-operated drones prior to the airstrike.
“Hikmatullah, a native Uzbekistani, had a history of divided loyalties; first as an Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan leader, followed by allegiance to the Taliban, and ultimately ISIS-K,” the release continued.
Mawlavi Habibul Rahman was reportedly named Hikmatullah’s successor.
“Rahman’s succession to a leadership role raises concerns across ISIS followers in remote, isolated areas of Jowzjan,” the release said. “Rahman has had intermittent ties to both the Taliban and GIRoA, highlighting the difficulty ISIS-K is having replacing leaders.”
Afghan Special Security Forces and U.S. Special Operations Forces counterterrorism operations have been successful in taking out potential ISIS-K leadership in the Jowzjan province.
“ASSF and U.S. SOF killed an ISIS-K platoon-level commander and another terrorist fighter during a partnered nighttime raid in Mughul, Mar. 26-27, 2018,” the press release said. “Four days earlier on Mar. 22, ASSF and USSOF eliminated four ISIS-K fighters in Darzab.”
ISIS-K platoon commanders Omair and Abu Samaya were killed in a U.S. airstrike on March 16.
“Later that evening, an ASSF nighttime raid on the ISIS-K headquarters in Jowzjan resulted in the removal of another 13 terrorists,” the release said. “Afghan forces captured Omair and Abu Samaya’s predecessor Khitab Aka, ISIS-K’s former head facilitator of foreign fighters in Jowzjan on Jan. 28.”

Title: Confused priorities of Afghan leadership – The Frontier Post
Iqbal Khan
As regards the political aspect of peace efforts in Afghanistan, reportedly, Taliban have rejected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s offer to take part in the upcoming parliamentary and district council elections. On military side, once looked down upon as rag tag militia, frequency of the Taliban attacking foreign occupation forces as well as the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) is on the rise. Such attacks are taking place across the country.
Night attacks, once the forte of occupation forces, have evolved into an important tactic and mainstay strategy of Taliban as well. Recently, Taliban ove-rran three checkpoints in Farah city, killing over 20 police officers before melting away. Supported by ni-ght vision devices, the Tali-ban quickly ransacked the checkpoints. While una-ble to face Taliban in combat, ANSF is focusing on conducting and supporting co-wardly crossborder attac-ks into Pakistani territories.
Frequency and ferocity of the night Taliban attacks are linked to attempts by Afghan forces, based in small checkpoints across the country, to hold territory that has been wrested away from the militants. Attacks by Taliban using sophisticated night-vision technology have risen during the past year, especially against police and militia units that do not have such equipment. Afghan officials have asked for the gear to be issued to their police officers, but American officials are reluctant to do so for fear that it would fall into Taliban hands.
Due wide spread corruption in the ANSF cadres, Taliban have acquired sufficient number of sophisticated gadgets like laser and infrared night vision devices. According to New York Times, previously unreported documents underline concerns about the Taliban’s growing sophistication on the battlefield.  According to Pentagon data, these combat support detection devices are mostly snatched from Afghan troops or bought from them. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has extensively reported on such transfer of weapon cases.
Night Vision devices are usually given only to elite Afghan commandos and police special mission units. Missing devices are reported as “battle losses,” but there is no record to support such losses. Afghan soldiers are believed to have sold these devices to the Taliban. With these night-vision enablers, Taliban fighters are able to approach Afghan bases nearly undetected before the attack. With this capability, Taliban have more than doubled the frequency night time attacks over the last three years. Taliban are using both tightly controlled American devices and other local and Russian combat gear that is widely available for purchase. Another reason for falling these weapons in the hands of Taliban is that some equipment is left behind on the battlefield by American or Afghan troops, including those held by those who get killed during the combat. Taliban Spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, has said that fighters obtained night-vision devices after attacking Afghan bases or capturing it from members of the Afghan security forces.
Interestingly while Taliban are making good use of these war fighting items, ANSF is unable to effectively use these due to poor training! American commanders in Afghanistan are now rethinking to withdraw the limited access they gave to ANSF to night-vision equipment. American commanders had been reluctant to give night-vision equipment to lower cadres of Afghan soldiers and police officers out of concern of widespread corruption among those forces. American military has begun to send older models of night-vision hardware to regular Afghan Army units.  Restrictions have also been imposed on infantry units with regard to use of equipment devices that could be seen only by night-vision gadgets. Helicopter are no longer obscure to Taliban fighters during night.
As some of this equipment falls into Taliban hands, these insurgents are joining a larger trend-Hi-tech combat, said David W. Barno, a retired lieutenant general who, once, led the Afghan war. Advanced equipment, such as drones and precision weapons, “is being seized by other extremist groups in other global conflict zones”, he said. “It’s going to be a problem…and it’s going to change how we operate”, Barno added. Net effect-public perception is that the Taliban could strike at will.
Afghan politicians often accuse Russia of arming the Taliban, including provision of night vision devices. Moscow denies this and is of the view that contacts with Taliban leaders are for discussions on countering Daesh threat, and on encouraging Taliban for peace talks with Afghan government. Actually, Russia has lost confidence in the American strategy with regard to stabilizing Afghanistan, hence it is reaching out to various Afghan factions in the country, including the Taliban.
Losing hope of winning against the Taliban, Afghan government is increasingly using its security personnel for carrying out cross border attacks in Pakistani territory astride international border. In one such attack on April 15, Pakistan’s Frontier Constabulary troops deployed along Pak-Afghan border it Kurram Agency area came under-fire, from the Afghan side, while they were on routine patrolling and fencing activity on the border. As there were a large number of tribesmen on Afghan side, Pakistani troops exercised utmost restraint to avoid civilian causalities.
There are safe havens of terrorist groups across the border in Afghanistan that carry out such attacks in Pakistan, as a matter of routine. Despite taking up the issue with Afghanistan as well as the coalition forces, cross-border attacks into Pakistan continue. Afghan side is resisting Pakistani campaign to beef up border security, which is a clear indication that it is not genuinely interested in restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan.  Pakistan sincerely believes that all outstanding issues and differences can be achieved through sustained and meaningful dialogue with the Afghan authorities. Hopefully, Afghan political and military leadership shall soon revisit its parties and realign these with the end objective-peace in Afghanistan.

2 Haqqani militants arrested in Afghanistan - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KABUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Two members of Haqqani militant group were arrested by Afghan Special Operations Forces in the country's eastern province of Logar, the command of special forces said Monday.
Acting on a confirmed tip off, a unit of special force launched a raid in Pali Khel village on the outskirts of provincial capital Pul-e-Alam city early on Sunday, capturing two Haqqani members, Operational Coordination Group Afghanistan (MoD-OCGA) said in a statement.
The security force also found and seized amount of weapons and ammunition after the raid, the statement added.
Afghan and the NATO and U.S.-led coalition forces continued in mopping-up operations as spring and summer, known as the fighting season, is drawing near in the mountainous country.
As a Taliban-linked group of militants, the Haqqani network is mostly operating in eastern provinces and capital Kabul, and has been responsible for many high-profile attacks against security forces.
The network, which was designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 2012, has yet to make comments.

Title: Manzoor Pashteen: 'Pashtuns are fed up with war' – DW – 04/11/2018
In a DW interview, anti-war activist Manzoor Pashteen says he is being harassed by Pakistan's security agencies for taking up the issue of extrajudicial killings and turning the Pashtun plight into a national discourse.
At the heart of South Asia's never-ending wars, Islamic extremism, militancy and human suffering have been the Pashtuns, who are in a majority in Pakistan's northern parts and most of Afghanistan. Since the 1980s, at least three generations of Pashtuns have paid a heavy price for the conflicts tearing their region apart. First, the Cold War rivalry between the former Soviet Union and the United States turned their territory into a war zone, and then the battle between the West and Islamists made them homeless, destitute and helpless.
Now a secular movement, led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, has struck a chord with thousands of Pashtuns, who say "enough is enough." The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (Movement for the Protection of Pashtuns, PTM) blames both the Pakistani military and Islamists for the destruction in their region.
Read more:Pashtuns rise up against war, Taliban and Pakistani military
Essentially an anti-war campaign, the PTM sprang up as a result of the killing of the 27-year-old Naqeebullah Masood, who was killed by police in the southern city of Karachi on January 20. The authorities claimed Masood had links with militants, a charge his family and civil society activists deny. Rights groups say that thousands of Pashtun youths have been murdered or abducted by security agencies in the past decades on unproven terrorism charges. State authorities use the pretext of war on terrorism to persecute Pashtuns, they say.
Over the years, Pashtuns have been branded as Islamists, or militants, due to the fact that the Taliban are also a Pashtun-dominated outfit, and because the radicalism in the country's northern areas has spiked over the years as a result of decades-long wars.
Read more:The godfather of the Taliban: Hamid Gul and his legacy
PTM leader Pashteen doesn't mince his words and has made it clear who he holds responsible for the Pashtun suffering: "We have to identify the place that destroyed us," Pashteen said at a recent rally. "It is GHQ!" he said, referring to the Pakistani military headquarters in Rawalpindi.
In an interview with DW, Pashteen talks about the objectives of his movement, accusations that he is supported by Afghanistan, and decades-long "injustices" to Pashtuns whose region has been used as a "battlefield" by local and foreign powers.
DW: What are the objectives of the PTM, and how are they different from the objectives of other Pashtun parties?
Manzoor Pashteen: Our objectives are clear. We demand that all "missing people" be released. If they have committed any crime, they should be tried in a court of law. Extrajudicial killings of Pasthuns must stop. A judicial commission should be formed to investigate these killings because we think they are pre-planned. Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud, a Pashtun youth who was killed by [senior police official in the southern city of Karachi] Rao Anwar, was falsely labeled as a Taliban militant.
We also demand that the authorities clear mines planted in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) during security operations, paramilitary forces stop harassing Pashtun families on the pretext of search operations and that people should not be humiliated at security check posts in the northwestern areas.
These are our demands. I think other Pashtun parties have not emphasized them.
Read more:Why Pakistan associates terrorism with Pashtuns and Afghans
How have Pakistani authorities responded to your demand of the release of "missing people"?
I have been told by intelligence agencies that I should give up this demand. But I have made it clear to them that even if they have killed all "missing persons," they must let us know. They told me they would accept any other demand except releasing "missing people" and the issue of extrajudicial killings.
You said in a public rally in Peshawar city on Sunday that you would want a trial against Ehsanullah Eshan, the former spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, and Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former military dictator [who ruled the country from 1999 to 2007]. Who would make that happen?
I am only talking about human rights abuses but some people in Pakistan have labeled me a "traitor" and "terrorist." But Ehsanullah Ehsan is the biggest terrorist, and Musharraf is the real traitor who destroyed Pakistan's democratic setup and committed many crimes, including the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, Former Chief Minister of Baluchistan province. Both Ehsan and Musharraf are responsible for the killings of innocent people. Ehsan did it through his terrorist organization and Musharraf committed genocide through unconstitutional military operations that caused destruction in our areas.
[Editor's note: Ehsanullah Ehsan is in the custody of Pakistani authorities]
Read more:What is Pakistan's militancy issue all about?

The issue of "missing persons" and extrajudicial killings is not restricted to FATA. Do you plan to work together with the affected families in other parts of the country to deal more effectively with the matter?
I would be glad to work with everyone. This is a national issue and we should work together to nip it in the bud for once and all.
You say the Pakistani military is responsible for the Pashtun suffering. What is the context of this accusation?
High-ranking Pakistani military officials have said on a number of occasions that they created the mujahideen (jihadists) and used Pashtuns to fight against the former Soviet Union. Since then, FATA has been used by the military as a safe haven and breeding ground for terrorists. Pashtuns have suffered immensely as a result of this.
Can the movement bring together Afghan and Pakistani Pashtuns against war?
Our movement is against the human rights violations of the Pashtuns. The movement is constitutional because none of our demands conflicts with the Pakistani constitution.
If Taliban safe havens are eliminated from Pakistan, particularly from FATA, and the Pakistani state discards the "good and bad Taliban" policy, the Pashtuns in Afghanistan will heave a sigh of relief.
Is the PTM facing threat from Pakistani authorities?
Some security officials told me I would be "declared" a "traitor" if I didn't stop my activities. They did exactly the same. They are now running a propaganda campaign against me that I work for Afghan and Indian intelligence agencies. They have also threatened to arrest me on "anti-state activities" charges.
The truth is that they don't have any evidence that I am backed by Afghanistan. I'm just fighting for the fundamental rights of the Pashtun people. I am not afraid because I have the public support. Pashtuns are just fed up with this war and kill-and-dump policy.

The United States and NATO are heavily involved in the Afghan conflict, which obviously has an impact on Pashtuns. What would be your demand from the US and other Western governments regarding your plight?
I urge the US and other Western countries to put an end to this bloody war in Afghanistan. War is not a solution, it is a problem. Peace can never be attained through war.
Do you think your movement will survive in the coming months? And do you plan to contest the 2018 general elections?
We won't compromise and will continue to make demands. We won't abandon this peaceful movement until we achieve our objectives.
Contesting election, however, is not my cup of tea and I am not a politician. Once our objectives are achieved, I will go home and don't make any noise. We just want peace.
Manzoor Pashteen is the leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (Movement for the protection of Pashtuns, PTM).
The interview was conducted by Shah Meer Baloch. The interview was originally conducted over phone in Urdu and has been edited for clarity.

Title: Pashtuns against war, Taliban, Pakistani army – DW – 04/09/2018
A new movement has sprung up in Pakistan's Pashtun-dominated northern areas. Its supporters, wary of their region being used as a battleground for years, have taken on both the Taliban and the nation's powerful military.
On May 15, it will be 30 years since the Soviet troops pulled out from Afghanistan, leaving the war-ravaged country to the mujahideen (Islamic warriors). Thousands of people had died during the 1980s Afghan War, in which the mujahideen were backed by the Pakistani military and the US. What followed the Soviet withdrawal was even more mayhem and bloodshed, with competing jihadist factions fighting for control over the capital Kabul.
The infighting ceased in 1996, when a group of Islamic students on both sides of the porous Afghanistan-Pakistan border captured Kabul, allegedly with the help of Pakistani authorities. A deadly calm prevailed for some years, but massive human rights violations continued until 2001, when the US avenged 9/11 terrorist attacks by bombing Afghanistan and ousting the brutal Taliban regime.

For a brief period of time, Afghans had hoped their country would finally experience peace. But the ensuing civil war, which continues to date, has killed thousands more.
The battle for Afghanistan continues. The Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, who Kabul and Washington say receive support from the Pakistani army and its Inter-Services Intelligence (IS) agency, control vast swathes of territory in the war-torn country. On the Pakistani side, the tribal areas along the Afghan border continue to suffer due to Islamist activities and the security forces' operations that caused deaths and displacements on a large scale.
At the heart of these never-ending wars, Islamic extremism, militancy and human suffering have been the Pashtuns, who are in a majority in Pakistan's northern parts and most of Afghanistan. Since the 1980s, at least three generations of Pashtuns have paid a heavy price for a conflict that was thrust on them from the outside. First, the Cold War rivalry between the former Soviet Union and the United States turned their territory into a war zone, and then the battle between the West and Islamists made them homeless, destitute and helpless.

Now a secular movement, led by young activist Manzoor Pashteen, has struck a chord with thousands of Pashtuns, who say "enough is enough."

'Justice for Pashtuns'
Ali Wazir, a central PTM official, said the movement demands an "end to enforced disappearances, constant insults to the Pashtun people, and violations of our rights."
"The authorities should launch a probe into extrajudicial killings [of our people]. They must drop the 'good and bad Taliban' policy that has harmed the region," Wazir told DW, referring to the Pakistani military establishment's alleged policy of distinguishing between the "good" Taliban groups that support its geopolitical view and the "bad" Taliban who have turned against the Pakistani state in the past few years.
Read more:What is Pakistan's militancy issue all about?
The PTM has thus irked the Pakistani military establishment, which has recently tried to appease the movement by releasing some activists, according to Pakistani media.
"We are receiving threats from the state institutions as well as the 'good Taliban,'" Wazir added.
Human Rights Watch said on March 13 that the Pakistani government "needs to end its longstanding discriminatory laws and practices against Pashtuns and act to end hostile attitudes toward them."
"This process could start by dropping the criminal cases against Manzoor Pashteen and other protest leaders wrongfully charged, fully investigating and fairly prosecuting those responsible for Naqeebullah Mehsud's death, and letting Pashtun voices be heard," it added.

'Simmering anger'
PTM leader Pashteen has acquired a "rock star activist" stature in the past few months. His rise to prominence has taken many by surprise. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which is governed by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan's conservative Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice, PTI) party, the "common man" Pashteen has managed to motivate the working class people on a grassroots level.
The PTM has also taken social media by storm in the absence of any significant coverage on mainstream media.
Senator Usman Kakar of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party is not part of the movement, but he can relate to some of the PTM demands.
"The PTM demands that all 'missing' Pashtuns should be produced before the court of law. It demands that all landmines in the northwestern tribal areas be cleared and the army stops demolishing Pashtuns' houses on suspicion of militant links," Kakar told DW.
"The [Pashtun] anger had been simmering for years. If it wasn't Pashteen, someone else would have started the movement," Kakar said.
Saleem Shah, an Islamabad-based researcher and social activist, says the PTM is different from other nationalist groups in the province. "No political group in Pakistan has challenged the military the way the PTM has. It is a movement run by the youth. It has become an international movement as Pashtuns across the globe are supporting it by holding solidarity rallies in different parts of the world," Shah told DW.
The big question is whether the movement can survive without a proper organizational structure.
"Mainstream Pashtun parties have an organizational structure and a political manifesto; the PTM doesn't," underlined Kakar, who admits that Pakistan's political parties are fearful of this new movement in a strategically important province.
"Pashtun nationalist parties usually do not want to offend the military because it could affect their political role. But Pashteen's claim to fame is that unlike other politicians he is clear about what he wants," Kakar said.

United Pashtuns?
The Afghan government, which usually refrains from commenting on Pakistan's domestic politics, has lauded Pashteen's campaign. Members of the Afghan parliament have called on Kabul to provide help to protesters in Pakistan. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani shared several tweets about the "Pashtun march" in February, hoping that it would succeed in "uprooting and eradicating terrorism from the region."
"I fully support the historical Pashtun Long March in Pakistan. The main purpose of which is to mobilize citizen against fundamentalism and terrorism in the region," Ghani said on Twitter.
The Pashtun issue has been a sensitive one for Pakistan since the South Asian country gained independence from British rule in 1947. With a large Pashtun population in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, the idea of an independent Pashtun-majority homeland baffled Pakistan right from the beginning. Some scholars say Pakistani authorities favored Islamization of the region to rein in the "Pashtunistan" movement, led by liberal and secular politicians and activists.
Read more:India's partition and 70 years of proxy jihad
The PTM could be viewed by Islamabad as another such effort to unite Pashtuns from both sides of the border, although the group hasn't said anything about it.
"Can the PTM unite Pashtuns across the Durand Line [Afghan-Pakistan border established by the British]? I think it is already doing it. Rallies have been staged in the Afghan city of Kandahar — the birthplace of the Taliban — Jalalabad city and the capital Kabul, in support of the PTM. Common Afghans are raising slogans of peace," researcher and activist Saleem Shah said.
Read more:Why the border can't separate Afghan and Pakistani Pashtuns
But Kabul's endorsement of the PTM could prove to be a double-edged sword. Some groups in Pakistan are already accusing Pashteen and the PTM of "foreign backing."
"By supporting PTM demonstration, the Afghan government wants to keep pressure on Pakistan," Yunas Fakur, a Kabul-based analyst, told DW.
"Ghani's government feels it could use the situation as a bargaining chip in Afghan peace negotiations," he added.
But many Afghan activists support the PTM movement because they see a direct link between the situation of Pashtuns on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
"When Pashtuns in Pakistan have access to better education and when they are not treated like second-class citizens, there will no longer be safe havens for terrorists in their areas," Faiz Mohammad Zaland, a lecturer at Kabul University, told DW.
But some say that Afghanistan's direct or indirect support to the PTM could be harmful for the movement.
"What Kabul is doing could backfire because Islamabad will use it as an excuse for its support for the the Taliban," Fakur said.

Title: Taliban, Haqqani enjoy safe havens in Pakistan: Pentagon | coastaldigest.com - The Trusted News Portal of India
Washington, Apr 13: Asserting that the Taliban and the Haqqani network enjoy safe havens in the border regions of Pakistan, a top US Army General today told the lawmakers that it was very difficult to contain insurgency in war-torn Afghanistan if Islamabad continues to harbour terrorists on its soil.
"It's very, very difficult to eliminate any insurgency if that insurgency has safe haven in another country. But right now, the Taliban, the Haqqanis and other organisations do, in fact, enjoy some safe haven in the border regions on the Pakistani side of the border. Pakistan has got to be part of the solution," General Mark A Milley, Chief of Staff of the US Army, told lawmakers during a Congressional hearing.
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said to the end insurgency in Afghanistan, it was important to reduce the threat of terrorism something that can be handled on a routine basis by the internal security forces.
"In order to do that, you have to essentially do several things. You mentioned Pakistan. That is key. It's important that Pakistan is part of the solution. It's a regional solution. Part of our strategy is a regional strategy. That very much involves Pakistan," Milley said.
Responding to a question on reconciliation, he said the Afghan government was on the path right now to establish some sort of political reconciliation with various opponent groups. US is in support of that effort, Milley added.
"So it's important that we realign the forces, that we reinforce the capabilities that we're already doing, and that we regionalise the problem, including Pakistan, and that there's some sort of reconciliation process. At the end of the day, that's how that ends, and it ends successfully, and I believe that's achievable, the General said.
Milley said it was in the national security interest of the United States to maintain troops in Afghanistan.
One of the American objectives since 2001 has been that Afghanistan no longer was a platform for terrorists to conduct strikes on the continental United States, or in the United States.
"That's key. That's why we're there, and that's why we're still there," he said, adding that this can be achieved through a stable Afghanistan.
"So what does that look like? It means that the armed opposition, the Taliban, Haqqani network, Al-Qaida, ISIS, K and all these other groups are reduced in terms of capability that they no longer present an existential threat to the regime in Kabul, and that the Afghan National Security Forces are at large," he said.
"Their army, their police, their intelligence forces can handle the violent threat against the regime at a level that is something akin to crime or banditry," Milley said.

Title: Taliban, Haqqanis should be included in Afghan 'political mainstream': Aizaz - SUCH TV
The Taliban and the Haqqani network need to part of the Afghan politics, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States said during a talk on Friday.
In his address at the Kashmir Solidarity Day being celebrated at the Pakistani Embassy here in the city, Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry stressed that the Afghan issue does not have a military solution.
Chaudhry was discussing the rising tensions between India and Pakistan and urged the US, as well as the global fraternity, to raise their voices against Indian brutality in Kashmir — something that has seriously aggravated over the past few days.
Pakistan's relations with the US should be based on mutual respect, the ambassador said, noting that any kind of concerns and suspicions may be detrimental to the bilateral relations.
Consequently, "apprehensions and concerns" in the linkage between Washington and Islamabad would be counterproductive to the ongoing anti-terrorism operation and significantly impact the Afghan peace and stability process.
Chaudhry also underscored that for peace to prevail in Afghanistan, its leadership needs to be consulted as well and that the Taliban and the Haqqani network need to part of the Afghan politics.
Responding to a question about the Haqqani network, Chaudhry said Pakistan's message to them and the Taliban "is very clear".
The "Taliban and Haqqanis are Afghanis and they should become part of the political mainstream in Afghanistan".
This, therefore, would make what he called a "comprehensive 'Afghan-led' and 'Afghan-owned' political solution".
"Pakistan stands firm by its commitment not to allow its soil to be used against any country and expect others to reciprocate," he said.
