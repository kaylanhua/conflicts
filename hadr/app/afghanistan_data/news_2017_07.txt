Title: Afghan Taliban

TheTaliban(Pashto:طالبان‎ṭālibān"students"), alternately spelledTaleban,  is anIslamic fundamentalistpolitical movement inAfghanistancurrently waging war (aninsurgency, orjihad) within that country.
From 1996 to 2001, it held power in Afghanistan and enforced a strict interpretation ofSharia, or Islamic law, of which the international community and leading Muslims have been highly critical.  
Until his death in 2013, MullahMohammed Omarwas the supreme commander and spiritual leader of the Taliban.Mullah Akhtar Mansoorwas elected as his replacement in 2015, but as of November 2015 there are conflicting reports that he may have been killed or badly wounded. As of mid-2015, the group is "directly or indirectly" supported in Afghanistan by "about a dozen" militant groups, having "different goals and agendas".
The movement originated in the early 1990s, but was not fully unified until its 1994 capture ofKandahar.  Under the leadership ofMohammed Omar, the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from theMujahideenwarlords, whose  corruption and despotism Afghans had tired of.  TheIslamic Emirate of Afghanistanwas established in 1996 and the Afghan capital transferred toKandahar. It held control of most of the country until being overthrown by the American-ledinvasion of Afghanistanin December 2001 following the September 11 attacks. Even at its peak formaldiplomatic recognitionof the Taliban's government was acknowledged by only three nations:Pakistan,Saudi Arabia, and theUnited Arab Emirates.  The group later regrouped asan insurgencymovement to fight the American-backedKarzai administrationand theNATO-ledInternational Security Assistance Force(ISAF).

Title: The Islamic State finds a friend in Pakistan – Sonoran News
The Islamic State’s local franchise in Afghanistan and Pakistan is the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), where the land of Khurasan represents parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
The Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) began establishing a presence in Syria in the late Spring of 2013. By mid-July 2013, both Reuters and the Associated Press reported that hundreds of Pakistanis from the TTP and the virulently anti-Shia Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) joined al-Qaeda and other Sunnis, including foreign combatants from places like Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, to battle the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad.
After the 2013 split between al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the LeJ’s top leadership went to Saudi Arabia and met ISIS leaders at an undisclosed location at Saudi-Iraq border. The visiting delegation from LeJ extended an invitation to ISIS leaders to visit Pakistan for more recruitment and support.
In September of 2014, a three-member ISIS delegation was received in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad. The group was escorted to Rawalpindi to meet Jamaat ud Dawa, the political arm of Laskar-e-Taiba, the terrorist group associated with Pakistani intelligence, the ISI, and responsible for the deadly 2008 Mumbai attack. The ISIS representatives also held talks with members of Jamaat Islami, Pakistan’s Islamist party and commanders of the various TTP armed militias.
Soon afterwards, ISIS propaganda and recruitment campaigns began.
On December 16, 2014, the Army Public School massacre in Peshawar took place. Seven gunmen affiliated with the TTP, but all of whom were foreign nationals, including one Chechen, three Arabs and two Afghans, entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children, killing 141 people, of which 132 were schoolchildren.
After the attack, the TTP continued its campaign of recruitment. On January 10, 2015 six TTP commanders announced their allegiance to ISIS. On January 26, ISIS accepted the TTP’s allegiance and announced the establishment of Islamic State of ‘Khorasan Province’ (ISKP).
Afghanistan became the first target.
The Afghan territory designated for establishing ISKP was strategically located and agriculturally self-sufficient, consisting of a complex web of caves, passes, villages, and routes stretching from Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, and Logar provinces via Nangarhar to Kunar and Nuristan.
That area borders Pakistan’s Kurram Agency, which is the closest point in Pakistan to Kabul. Kurram Agency, with its many Pakistani military installations and training camps, has been safe haven and resupply area for terrorists and extremists since the start of the war against the Soviet Union.
The manpower of ISKP comprised a mixture of Pakistani Army regulars, the Frontier Constabularies (FC), and a combination of TTP splinter factions and other terrorist groups like the LeJ, many of whom had been fighting in Syria. Mixing Pakistan Army regulars and irregulars has been a tested formula for decades on Pakistan’s eastern border with India.
In retrospect, nothing appears to be more deliberately home-grown than the Islamic State in Pakistan.
The ISKP base in Nangarhar eventually came under assault by U.S. and Afghan forces and was the site of the “Mother of All Bombs” attack in April of this year, all of which essentially wiped out ISKP operations in the region.
ISKP expansion in Pakistan is now focused in Balochistan, where about two dozen commanders of Pakistani terrorist groups including Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi, Jundullah and Junood-ul-Hifza appear to have joined forces and, under the guidance of ISIS, executed major attacks, killing more than 325 innocent people since 2016.
From the standpoint of U.S. policy formulation, the threat emanating from South Asia is no longer confined to Afghanistan and the Taliban, but is now clearly transnational.
The plethora of globally-oriented terrorist groups incubating in Pakistan dwarfs that posed by pre-9/11 Afghanistan.

Title: US Confirms Killing of Additional IS Leaders in July 11 Airstrike
Print
U.S. military officials have confirmed the death of four additional senior Islamic State leaders in a July 11 airstrike in northeastern Afghanistan that also killed the top leader of the terrorist group.
The drone attack struck IS headquarters in Kunar province, which borders Pakistan, and eliminated Abu Sayed, the amir of Islamic State’s self-styled Khorasan province branch, or ISK-P.
A U.S. military statement Sunday listed names and titles of the four slain terrorists identified as senior IS advisors, including Sheik Ziaullah, Mulawi Hubaib, Haji Shirullah, and Assadullah.
The U.S. military confirmed Sayed’s death at the time, but could not immediately provide details of other commanders killed by the missile strike.
Sayed was the third ISK-P chief the U.S. military has eliminated in the past year in its bid to prevent the group from establishing a foothold in Afghanistan.
"We will be relentless in our campaign against ISIS-K,” the statement quoted General John Nicholson, Commander of U.S. forces in the country. He used one of several IS names.
"There are no safe havens in Afghanistan. We will hunt them down until they are no longer a threat to the Afghan people and the region,” he added.
Observers acknowledge the death of Abu Sayed and other top leaders have dealt a considerable blow to the group’s Afghan operations.
U.S. airstrikes have primarily been responsible for killing about 20 founding and some of “second-generation” leaders of ISK-P since it launched extremist activities in the country two years ago, notes Kabul-based Afghanistan Analysts Network (AAN).
“The ‘decapitation’ of ISK-P has been well underway over the past two years as the US military has stepped up its military campaign, mainly through air strikes, against the group in Nangarhar,” the non-governmental organization wrote in an article last week.
The eastern province of Nangarhar borders Kunar, and several of its districts are considered IS strongholds. Afghan security forces, backed by U.S. airpower, have been conducting major operations in the province to eliminate IS bases.
IS is also under attack from Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency and facing emerging internal differences, but there are no visible signs its appeal to some radicalized sectors is fading, AAN warns.
“ISKP has shown it is resilient. Recruits continue to pour in to Nangarhar from various provinces of Afghanistan as well as from Pakistan,” the watchdog noted, adding the group can be expected to put all its efforts into holding out against Afghan and U.S. forces to retain its strongholds in Nangarhar.

Title: Militant violence kills 10 Afghan journalists in first half of 2017 - Afghanistan | ReliefWeb
Afghanistan
By Ayaz Gul
ISLAMABAD — Ten journalists have been killed in Afghanistan so far this year in militant attacks plotted by the Taliban and Islamic State loyalists, a media monitoring group said.
Violence during the first six months of 2017 also wounded 12 journalists, the Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) said in a report released Tuesday in Kabul.
The group's head, Najib Sharifi, told reporters it documented 73 cases of violence against journalists, a 35 percent increase compared to the first six months of 2016.
The violence included killing, beating, injury, humiliation, intimidation and detention of journalists, he added.
“Those killed have either been directly targeted by terrorist groups or lost their lives as a result of terrorist attacks,” noted Sharifi.
The media organization says that IS-plotted violence and threats against journalists have particularly increased in eastern Afghanistan, where the terrorist group has a strong presence.
“In this zone, the majority of media organizations and journalists practically live under the threat of the ISKP group,” AJSC warned, using the local acronym for the Syria-based terrorist group.
An attack on state-run Radio Television-Afghanistan, or RTA, in May killed four employees, while a massive truck bombing in the vicinity of the German embassy in Kabul also that month claimed the lives of four journalists in the line of duty, according to the report. One-hundred-and-50 other people were killed.
A March attack against the parliament in the capital city killed two journalists.
AJSC noted, however, individuals affiliated with the Afghan government, or security forces, have also been responsible for 46 percent of all the instances of violence against journalists since the beginning of the year.
“The violence carried out by the government officials is mostly committed because of revelations by journalists of illegal activities of these government-affiliated individuals and institutions,” the report said.
It praised steps the Afghan government has taken to improve the security of journalists, including establishment of a Joint Committee for the Security and Safety of Journalists, but lamented that “weak implementation” has not produced desired outcomes.
The report also noted rising insecurity and a “worsening threat environment" in Afghanistan have also led to a “notable decrease” in the number of female journalists working in media organizations, with none working in at least 10 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.
The reduction or absence of female media members, AJSC warned, has undermined coverage of women-related problems.
The increase in violence in Afghanistan is evident in a recent United Nations report that says armed conflict has killed more than 1,600 civilians in the first six months of 2017.

Title: ISIS' Afghan leader killed in US strike | ISIS' Afghan leader killed in US strike
Washington:US forces have killed the head of Islamic State’s Afghanistan branch in a strike on the terror group’s headquarters in Kunar Province (ISIS-K), the Pentagon has said.
The killing of Abu Sayed, the emir of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Khorasan Province(ISIS-K), marked the third time within a year that the terror group’s Afghanistan branch has lost its leader.
“US forces killed Abu Sayed, the emir  of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), in a strike on the group’s headquarters in Kunar Province,  Afghanistan, on July 11,” Pentagon spokesman Dana White said.
The raid also killed other ISIS-K members and will significantly disrupt the terror group’s plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan, she said.
ISIS leaders chose Abu Sayed to lead the group after Afghan and US forces killed the previous ISIS-K leaders, Hafiz Sayed Khan in late July 2016, and Abdul Hasib, in late April of this year.
“Afghan and US forces launched a counter-ISIS-K offensive in early March to drive fighters from Nangarhar and send a clear message to ISIS that there is no sanctuary for their fighters in Afghanistan,” Ms White said.
General John Nicholson, who leads US forces-Afghanistan, said, “We will continue until they are annihilated. There is no safe haven for ISIS-K in Afghanistan.”
The US has been hitting ISIS targets in the war-torn country regulaly and in April it dropped the largest non- nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat.
The deployment of the so-called Mother Of All Bombs (MOAB) killed at least 95 jihadists, according to reports.

Title: ISIS-K on Back-foot in Afghanistan: Pentagon - News18
Edited By:Huma Tabassum
PTI
Last Updated:July 18, 2017, 08:15 IST
(Representative image/Reuters)
Washington:The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has lost its hold in Afghanistan, days after the terror group's head Abu Sayed, was killed by US troops in an airstrike, the pentagon has said.

The Pentagon now estimates that ISIS-K in Afghanistan numbers somewhere in the hundreds.

"We don't think it's over 1,000. They hold no meaningful territory in Nangarhar province. There are certainly fighters there but they're mostly spending their time trying to stay alive," said Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt Jeff Davis.

During an off-camera news conference on Sunday, Davis said the killing of ISIS-K leader Abu Sayed in a drone strike last week disrupted it’s expansion plans.

"His death will further disrupt the group's plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan," he said, adding that this is the third time in the past year that US forces in Afghanistan have killed a sitting leader of ISIS-K.

"Killed in a kinetic strike on July 11 in Kunar, Abu Syed was the overall ISIS-K Amir in Afghanistan for only six weeks, issuing operational guidance, financial management and acting as the primary decision-maker for operations with ISIS- throughout Afghanistan," he said.

"His death comes not long after that of his predecessor, Sheikh Abdul Hasib, who was killed by US forces in a raid on April 26 in Achin, Nangarhar province as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan," he added.

"ISIS threatens America and the west because of its commitment to plot, direct and inspire terrorist attacks and its ability to recruit, move and finance the terrorists who commit these attacks," he said, adding that the terrorists have been very clear in their propaganda magazine and other publications, that they want to recruit and attack globally.

"ISIS-K called was formed in January 2015 as a despondent group of several Islamic extremist organizations, loosely organized and committed to supporting the radical ideals of the Islamic State," Davis said, adding that ISIS-K is committed to establishing an Afghan presence on behalf of ISIS and furthering ISIS' Caliphate to the abolition of traditionally recognised sovereign borders.

"Their primary focus was on establishing a stronghold in Nangarhar Province but they maintain a presence in other pockets of Afghanistan. Their brutal tactics and social media use are in line with ISIS' messaging strategy and puts them at odds with fellow organisations," Davis said.

The Afghan forces partnered with US forces are keeping constant pressure on them.

"We assess that they are most active in Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan. We've been putting pressure on them as they try to gain footholds elsewhere," the Pentagon spokesman said.

Title: US Drone Kills ISIS Leader in Afghanistan - NewsBlaze News
An American drone killed an ISIS leader in a raid on the terror group’s headquarters in Kunar province, eastern Afghanistan.
Abu Sayed, the leader or “emir” of the Islamic State in Afghanistan, and other militants were killed by the operation headed byUS forces.
Thenewswas confirmed by the Pentagon in a statement, asserting that the successful operation will “significantly disrupt the terror group’s plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan.”
The Islamic State, also know as ISIS, launched a deadly rampage in the conflict-hit nation over the past year.
The successful operation against the terror group was considered a victory on the US side.
Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters on Friday that the death of a leader like Sayed “sets them back for a day a week, a month, it’s about who it is and what kind of people are below them. It is obviously a victory on our side in terms of setting them back, it’s the right direction.”
In addition, Gen. John Nicholson, Commander, US Forces Afghanistan said in a statement, “This operation is another success in our campaign to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017. Abu Sayed is the third ISIS-K emir we have killed in the last year and we will continue until they are annihilated. There is no safe haven for ISIS-K in Afghanistan.”
Sayed became the next-in-line leader of the terror group after his two predecessors were killed in a US-Afghan commando raid last year. Hafiz Sayed Khan was killed in July 2016 and another emir, Abdul Hasib was also killed in April.
The April operation left two United States Army Rangers dead and resulted in the deaths of several other top leaders of ISIS-K, and 35 ISIS fighters.
The U.S. currently has 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, training and advising the Afghan military in the fight against terror groups, particularly the notorious Taliban and the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan.
Afghanistanhas been rocked by insurgencies and targeted by terror attacks perpetrated by the Taliban and ISIS.
In 2016, three ISIS suicide bombers launched an attack on the Pakistani consulate in Jalalabad. The attack left six people dead, as well as the three assailants.
On June 20, 2016, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a bus carrying Nepalese security guards in Kabul.The attack killed at least 16 people. ISIS identified the bomber as Irfanullah Ahmed and published a photo of him.

Title: The End of Afghanistan’s Spring Fighting Seasons and the Demise of the Afghan National Security Forces? | Small Wars Journal
The End of Afghanistan’s Spring Fighting Seasons and the Demise of the Afghan National Security Forces?[i]
Barnett S. Koven
While many rejoice the arrival of spring, Afghans know that this season ushers in a considerable increase in fighting. Or at least it used to. A confluence of three factors – the conclusion of poppy cultivation, improved weather conditions and recesses in madrassas in neighboring Pakistan – have made spring Afghanistan’s ‘fighting season.’ However, 2016 marked the first year, since insurgent violence first surged in 2006, where the arrival of spring did not correlate with an increase in insurgent attacks. Indeed, attacks trended downward as the season progressed. Moreover, insurgent violence fell precipitously compared to 2015 (1,338 attacks in 2016 versus 1,716 incidents in 2015; a decrease of 22 percent). Figure 1, below, depicts this trend, as well as casualty rates, using data from 2012 through 2016. Paradoxically, this is cause for serious concern. While one might think that the end to Afghanistan’s fighting season and a considerable decline in attacks is a positive development,‘the logic of violence in civil war’is far more nuanced. Specifically, violence decreases as a belligerent cements control over territory. In this case, decreasing violence appears to be the result of increasing Taliban control and the rapid deterioration of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).

This article proceeds in four sections. The first explains the aforementioned factors that contributed to the seasonality of fighting in Afghanistan. The subsequent section summarizes the extant literature, which explains trends in insurgent violence. The penultimate section analyzes the latest data from theGlobal Terrorism Data(GTD) and other sources, with specific reference to the theories explained in the previous section. The final section concludes.
Seasonality and Conflict in Afghanistan
As previously noted, Afghanistan’s spring surge in violence corresponds to agricultural cycles, improved weather and breaks in instruction at Pakistani madrassas. This section explores the relationship between each of these three factors and springtime fighting.
Arguably, agricultural cycles have the greatest impact on defining the Afghan fighting season. This is the case for two reasons. First, the Taliban rely on the cultivation and trafficking of opium poppy to finance their insurgency. As such, fighting occurs around opium poppy cultivation cycles. Specifically, theUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime(UNODC) reports that opium cultivation has surged from a low of just 8,000 hectares under cultivation in 2001 to a high of 224,000 hectares in 2014, before tapering off slightly in 2015. The farm-gate value of the crop peaked earlier, in 2011, at over $1.4 billion. While the farm-gate value decreased to $572 million in 2015, significant value is added through subsequent refinement and trafficking. The Taliban are heavily involved in these activities as well.
Beyond the Taliban’s financial interest in opium poppy production, the harvest season robs the Afghan Taliban of much of their fighting force. One Afghan expert noted that three distinct classes of Taliban fighters exist. Specifically, he indicated that the ‘ideological Taliban,’ which as the name implies are those insurgents who are deeply ideologically committed, represent only a very small percentage of the groups fighting force. A second group that he termed the ‘mercenary Taliban’ constitute a relatively larger fraction of the Taliban’s overall force strength. This group is heavily involved in the opium economy and other illicit actives. It sides with the Taliban due to the opportunity to profit handsomely from opium cultivation and related activities and not because of ideology. By far the largest group of fighters, are the ‘paycheck Taliban,’ who are comprised of seasonal or otherwise under-employed or unemployed young men who take-up arms to earn a paycheck when they are not engaged in productive economic activity.[ii]In Afghanistan, where as much as40 percentof the economy is agrarian, the bulk of these fighters are agricultural workers. In short, during harvest times, the number of available insurgent fighters is substantially lower.
Second, harsh weather makes winter fighting extremely challenging. Specifically, the confluence of extremely difficult terrain, limited improved road networks and substantial snowfall make overland travel next to impossible in parts of the country. For example, a particularly strong winter storm dumped more thanfive feet of snowin parts of the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan during just a 24 hours period earlier this year. This particular storm left more than100 Afghans dead. These types of weather dynamics are common place and some remote parts of Afghanistan remain completely cutoff from the rest of the country by inclement weather for as many assix months a year.
Finally, existing research on civil wars and insurgencies show that the presence ofcross-border sanctuariesgreatly exacerbates the duration of conflicts and the odds of an opposition victory. Not surprisingly, ample evidence from the conflict in Afghanistan highlights the criticality ofsecure basing in Pakistanto the success of the Afghan Taliban.[iii]Importantly,madrassason the Pakistani side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which provide a combination of religious education and military training, go on recess in the spring. Though this may be as much a consequence as a cause of the spring fighting season.
‘The Logic of Violence in Civil War’
As already noted, decreasing violence during insurgent conflicts can be cause for celebration or serious concern. This is the case as it may signal that the counterinsurgent is cementing control or that insurgent forces are gaining ground. In explicating this phenomena, Stathis Kalyvas classified areas within insurgent conflicts on a one to five scale based on territorial control. Areas under total incumbent control are coded a 1, areas under dominant incumbent control are denoted by a 2, contested areas are a 3, areas under dominant insurgent control are classified as a 4 and areas under complete insurgent control are marked as 5. As government forces gain (movement from zone 3 to 2) or consolidate (movement from zone 2 to 1) control, we would expect to see an increase in fighting. Similarly, as insurgent forces gain (a movement from zone 3 to 4) or consolidate (movement from zone 4 to 5) control, violent attacks are also likely to increase. In the former scenario an increase in violence is positive. The opposite is the case in the latter. However, Kalyvas not only shows that there is a correlation between changing zones of control and levels of violence, he also demonstrates that the type of violence depends on the zone of control. Specifically, in zone 3, civilian populations are unlikely to provide intelligence to either side because neither belligerent is dominant and doing so risks repercussions from the other side. Absent extensive human intelligence sources, both sides will be forced to rely more heavily on indiscriminant violence. As one side gains control (a move from zone 3 to either zone 2 or 4), risks decrease for civilians providing intelligence to the dominant side. As such, the belligerent that has gained control will be able to perpetrate violence more selectively. Doing so is also desirable as it is less likely to alienate the population and more efficient.
Violent Attacks, Territorial Control and the End of the Afghan Spring Fighting Season
After just over 13 years in-country, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) pulled out of Afghanistan on December 28, 2014. With the departure of ISAF, which at its heighted totaled more than130,000NATO and allied soldiers, the ANSF were left to continue fighting the Taliban largely on their own. (Even though9,804U.S. troops and a much smaller contingent from other NATO members remained behind, experts agree that not only is this an inadequate force-strength to prop up the ANSF, but the fact that the vast majority of these forces are relegated to train and equip missions and cannot be deployed in combat operations, further limits their impact.) Unfortunately, the ANSF forces arehampered byrampant corruption, inconsistent training across military units, difficulty retaining qualified personnel, as well as limited abilities to undertake complex operations involving combined arms integration. Corruption, in particular, deserves special attention. A January 2016 report noted that as much as 40 percent of the ANSF are‘ghost’soldiers and police officers. Specifically, these personnel – if they ever existed in the first place – have either been killed or deserted. Nevertheless, their commanders keep them on the books and pocket their pay and rations.
Under these conditions, and absent ISAF support, it is unsurprising that the Taliban surged in 2015. Specifically, the GTD notes that insurgent attacks increased from 1,594 in 2014 to 1,716 in 2015 (a nearly 8 percent increase). Moreover, the number of resulting fatalities climbed from 4,507 to 5,307 (an increase of almost 18 percent). Onereportnotes that ANSF casualties in 2015 alone were double the number of insurgent casualties inflicted by U.S. forces in the preceding 13 years. Nevertheless, violence decreased markedly in 2016. Specifically, 2016 experienced only 1,338 attacks (a decrease of more than 22 percent from 2015 and over 16 percent from 2014).[iv]Figure 2, below, depicts these trends graphically.

Furthermore, an examination of Figure 1, above, shows that there is no evidence of the characteristic spring fighting season in 2016. Figures 3 and 4, below, display similar trends. Specifically, Figure 3 presents a snapshot of the results of emerging hot spot analysis conducted utilizing the GTD data[v]from 2012 to 2015, while Figure 4, examines the time period from 2012 to 2016. Each cube represents a five square mile grid. The analysis shows that sporadic hotspots, which entail a repeated pattern of fighting during certain three month time periods and not others, were relatively prevalent in the analysis ending in 2015 (Figure 3). However, once the analysis is extended through 2016, sporadic hot spots, and thus seasonality in fighting remain in just two areas, the capital, Kabul, and in Afghanistan’s second largest city and commercial hub, Jalalabad. These results are robust across analyses for the entire country. What explains this apparent reversal?
Figure 3: Emerging Hot Spot Analysis, 2012-2015

Figure 4: Emerging Hot Spot Analysis, 2012-2016

Unfortunately, it is likely the case that violence declined in 2016 because the Taliban had succeeded in retaking territory in 2015, which also explains the marked increase in violence during 2015. Indeed, within a year of ISAF’s withdrawal, the Taliban controlledmore territoryin Afghanistan than at any time since 2001.[vi]Following the logic of violence in civil wars, if enhanced territorial control explains the decrease in violence and the end of the spring fighting season, we would also expect to see a change in the nature of violence. Indeed, we do. Specifically, attacks became better targeted and more selective. As regards targeting, even though 2016 experienced 22 percent fewer attacks than 2015, the number of fatalities per attack increased by over nine percent (from an average of 3.09 fatalities per attack in 2015, to an average of 3.38 in 2016; see Figure 2, above, for a graphical representation of these data). Increasing lethality is likely a result of improved intelligence – due to the Taliban’s enhanced territorial control – enabling better targeting. In a similar vein, attacks became more selective. Specifically, ANSF casualtiescontinued to risein 2016. While civilian casualties also increased in 2016, they did so at a farlower rate. Moreover, the number of Taliban inflicted civilian casualties actually fell. The overall rise in civilian casualties is due to the emerging presence of the Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan. While the IS had previously been a minor player in the country, in 2016 it caused more than anorder of magnitude morecivilian casualties than it had during the previous year.
Even though the Taliban do not control all of Afghanistan, the ANSF have often proven unable to sustain fighting with the Taliban when they threaten new areas. As such, further territorial expansion by the Taliban may not require as many attacks as it had previously. For example, in March 2017, the Taliban retook the strategic town of Sangin in Helmand province after the ANSFwithdrew, ostensibly to avoid civilian casualties. However, the Taliban’sclaimto have captured 39 armored personnel carriers, one tank and 34 other vehicles that the ANSF left behind, suggests a hasty retreat. Sangin is a critical location for Taliban opium smuggling operations. Again, the emerging hot spot analysis is consistent with this explanation. Despite the fact that the Taliban continued to capture territory in 2016, there are virtually no new hot spots evident in Figure 4, above. This indicates that fighting is not breaking out, even when the Taliban moves into new territories and ANSF withdraws. This is in stark contrast to the Taliban’s 2015 territorial expansion efforts, which resulted in extensive fighting, as illustrated in Figure 3, also above. (There are virtually no more consecutive hot spots evident in Figure 4, which indicates that sustained fighting is also no longer occurring. Again, this finding sharply contrasts with patterns evident prior to 2016, depicted in Figure 3.)
Conclusion
In short, the apparent decline in violence and the end of seasonality in fighting in 2016 appear to indicate that the Taliban has made substantial inroads against the ANSF. Furthermore, even though the number of attacks has declined, casualties are up as each attack is now more effective. Moreover, the ANSF are increasingly being targeted by attacks. This is likely the case as increased territorial control affords the Taliban better intelligence. Nevertheless, it is unclear what 2017 has in store for Afghanistan. On the one hand, it is possible that violence will continue to decline as the ANSF forces are further weakened and the Taliban continue to expand their territorial control. Indeed, as of late 2016, the Taliban had alreadyencircled six provincial capitals. On the other hand, it is possible that violence will rise and seasonality will again define the fighting as the IS begins to presenta greater challengeto the Taliban. The deployment of additional Western troops, which is now being considered following a massive explosion in the, supposedly highly secure, diplomatic area of Kabul thatkilled 80during rush hour on May 31, 2017, could also have similar effects. (Importantly, the Taliban, who are often quick to take credit for their exploits, have already denied responsibility for the bombing.) However, this will depend on the number of additional troops, restrictions on their employment and the length of time additional troops will remain in-theater.

Title: Taliban in Afghanistan Still Active, Tank Hits Afghan Forces | Al Bawaba
Multiple casualtiesare feared as the Taliban militants used armored vehicles to storm the security ring and surrounding check posts in restive Helmand province Thursday morning.
Local officials told Anadolu Agency the militants hit the barriers at the security ring in Grishk district with two explosive-laden armored vehicles.
Abdul Salam, spokesman for the provincial police headquarters, said twoAfghansoldiers and three policemen were injured in the attack. “A third vehicle bombing was prevented by the security forces. Fresh ground and air forces have been dispatched to the area to quell the attack”, he said.
This is the first time the militants have used armored vehicles -- which were snatched from the security forces during previous clashes -- for suicideattack in Afghanistan.
Lying south to the Taliban’s birthplace Kandahar, Helmand remains one of the most insecure provinces in Afghanistan with the militants controlling large swaths of land.
Earlier this week, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) backed by the U.S. airpower managed to reclaim restive Nawa district in Helmand after over a year when the Taliban overrun it.
Umar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor, has also confirmed that six members of the ANSF got wounded in the attack.
He claimed 18 attackers were killed in retaliation.
The Taliban, however, have made claims of killing up to 30 policemen, and overrunning a military base and many check posts.

Title: Haqqani network being run from Afghanistan: FO
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan hit out at the accusations from the United States that it continues to support the militant Haqqani network stating clearly that current statistics make it evident that, in fact, the Haqqani network was based inside Afghanistan and was operating from there.
Pakistan's response comes at a time when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has met President Ashraf Ghani in Tajikistan when the fate of two kidnapped Pakistani diplomats is still unknown. The diplomats were based in the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jalalabad -- an eastern on June 16 while traveling to Pakistan by road
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office declined to comment on US Senator John McCain’s warnings that if Pakistan does not stop supporting the Haqqani network, the United States should change its attitude towards the Pakistan nation, saying these were mere media reports.
“We have made it very clear that we expect they [Pakistan] will cooperate with us, particularly against the Haqqani network and against terrorist organisations,” McCain told the Afghan media.
However, during the weekly media briefing, the spokesman gave a detail response to prove the presence of the Haqqani network inside Afghanistan, saying that this was a mere attempt to put the blame of failures in Afghanistan on others.
“On June 12, 2017, TTA leader, Mullah Abdul Bari, was killed by Afghan 215th Maiwand Corps in Nad-e-Ali, Helmand. Reuters in its August 30, 2016, news reported killing of four commanders of Haqqani network in US airstrike in Afghanistan’s Jani Khel district. The report also mentioned that Haqqani fighters have ‘traditional stronghold’ in Eastern Afghanistan,” said the spokesman.
He also pointed to TOLO News reported killing of Haqqani commander, Karnail, on July 25, 2016 in eastern Khost province of Afghanistan in an encounter with the Afghan security forces. An English daily carried datelines of New Indian Express and Xinhua news agency on 10th June, to report killing of Haqqani commander, Sirajuddin Khademi, in a US drone strike in Sarwaza district of Paktika province on 8 June, added the spokesman saying that the report mentioned that Haqqani network, regarded as military wing of Taliban outfit, has been operating mostly in Afghanistan’s eastern provinces and Kabul.
“TTP, TTA, Daesh, JuA, remnants of al-Qaeda and a number of    other splinter groups are settled in the ungoverned spaces in Afghanistan. The TTP and TTA have fled to Afghanistan,” he commented.
To several queries, the spokesman reiterated that the recent discussions in Islamabad with the visiting US senators focused on  the issue of peace efforts in Afghanistan.
“The US policy on Afghanistan is expected, shortly. There is convergence of thoughts of both the US and Pakistan in the context. Pakistan’s position on the efforts for reconciliation is clear. We believe in Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process. We also firmly believe that peace and security in Afghanistan has direct bearing on the peace and security in Pakistan. Peace in Afghanistan is in Pakistan’s interest. We fully support all efforts aimed at bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan,” he clarified.
Meanwhile, Pakistan welcomed Iranian Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s statement in which he spoke about the plight of the people of Kashmir in Indian Held Kashmir (IHK).
“The entire Muslim Ummah is concerned over grave human rights situation in IHK. The OIC has repeatedly condemned Indian atrocities and called for an independent fact finding mission to be sent to Indian occupied Kashmir. Pakistan believes that India must be confronted to immediately stop the bloodshed in IHK and call for an early implementation of relevant UNSC Resolutions that promise Kashmiris UN-supervised plebiscite to exercise their right to self-determination,” said the spokesman.
As world capitals continue to look away from the continuing barbarism against the Kashmiris, the spokesman reminded them about Indian forces in IHK using ammunition containing chemical agents and precursors to kill Kashmiri youth and destroy Kashmiris’ properties. Charred bodies of Kashmiri youth were found in the debris of five houses destroyed by the Indian forces at Bahmnoo and Kakpora in Pulwama.
“The bodies were so extensively burnt that they were beyond visual recognition.  Body of Kifayat Ahmad, one of the three martyred youth, could be identified. There were more such occurrences of crimes by the Indian army. If use of chemicals in the ammunition is confirmed, then it would constitute a serious violation of Int’l norms and India’s Int’l obligations under Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),” he added.
News Desk adds: When asked about the sale of advanced weapons to India by different countries, the FO spokesperson said Pakistan is deeply concerned on the matter which undermines the objectives of preserving strategic balance in the region.
He said Pakistan will continue to raise its voice at the international fora which should objectively assess its actions and policies towards South Asian region. He said Pakistan is not oblivious to safeguarding its national security.
