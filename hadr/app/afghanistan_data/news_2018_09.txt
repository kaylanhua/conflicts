Title: Peace in Afghanistan: US Must Formulate A Strategy That Deals Directly With The Taliban And The Haqqani Network’s Sanctuary Inside Pakistan | John Ubaldi | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam

September 19, 2018
The famous philosopher George Santayana
famously quoted, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.” This statement particularly applies to the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
The U.S. recently commemorated the 9/11
terror attacks that precipitated our involvement in Afghanistan. But since
2001, the United States has been unable to deal with the insurgent activity
inside Pakistan.
The Strength of an Insurgency
Whenever an insurgent group like the
Taliban enjoys a sanctuary inside a neighbouring country, they will either win
or drag out the conflict. If the United States is to be successful in bringing
stability to Afghanistan, it must place a significant amount of pressure on the
Taliban and Haqqani network inside Pakistan and stop Islamabad’s support for
these terrorist organizations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford recently traveled to
Pakistan. They sought to persuade Islamabad to stop supporting proxy forces
inside Afghanistan and start supporting the peace process.
Since the U.S. military intervention into
Afghanistan, Pakistan has become a safe haven for the Taliban and other Islamic
terror groups who operate with impunity, all under the watchful eye of
Islamabad. Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was even allowed to escape
across the border following the U.S. military incursion.
Trump: Time to Hold Pakistan Accountable
In the summer of 2017, President Trump
remarked that “Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and
terror.” This past New Year’s Day, Trump tweeted that the United States has
“Foolishly given Pakistan more than $33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15
years” with little in return, promising “No more!”
Days before Pompeo’s and Dunford’s visit to
Pakistan, the United States placed added pressure on Islamabad. The federal
government announced the cancelation of a $300 billion military aid package,
which had coincided with a broader revocation of aid this past January.
So far, the Trump administration has not
been successful in getting Pakistan to change its behaviour. Similarly, former
president George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were stymied by Pakistan.
Why Has the US
Experienced a Lack of Success in Afghanistan?
Various reasons
hinder the ability of the U.S. to bring stability to Afghanistan. These reasons
include:
The lack of
effective Afghan governance at the regional level
The over-focus
on military tactics
The Taliban’s
ability to secure resources from foreign donors and the drug trade
The sanctuary
that Pakistan offers to the Taliban
Seth G. Jones, Senior Adviser to the
International Security Program at the Centre for International Studies,
reported that “The Taliban’s senior Shura (also called the Rahbari Shura or
leadership council) continues to reside in Pakistan, as do the Taliban’s
regional Shuras that support the Afghan war. In addition, Pakistan’s
Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) still provides sanctuary and
aid to groups like the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network that are fighting the
United States and its allies in Afghanistan.”
What the US Should Do to Bring Peace to
Afghanistan
For the United States to be successful in
bringing peace to Afghanistan, it must move beyond the tactical approach and
formulate a strategic strategy that deals directly with the Taliban and the
Haqqani network’s sanctuary inside Pakistan. If this strategy is not created,
the U.S. will just replicate the mistakes of the past 17 years.
To turn the conflict around, U.S. leaders
should remember the axiom articulated by military expert and Prussian general
Carl Von Clausewitz in his famous military treatise, “On War.” Von Clausewitz
defined “the Centre of Gravity,” which is “the source of power that provides
moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act.”
In any insurgency, the source of strength
is the population. When the U.S. has Afghanistan’s citizens on its side, the
chance for peace will increase exponentially.
Success Relies on Winning over
Afghanistan’s Population
Both the Taliban and the Afghan government
are competing to mobilize Afghanistan’s population to unite with their
respective sides. Unfortunately, the Taliban has been more successful in
gaining the support of citizens.
In the past year, the Taliban has gained
more influence and control over the Afghan population. Much of the support has
come from rural areas, because the local population is disillusioned with the
current government.
The United States needs to understand that
the local population doesn’t adhere to the Taliban’s extreme Islamic ideology,
except in southern, eastern and western Afghanistan – including the provinces
of Wardak, Nuristan and Zabul. But with extensive corruption from the Afghani
government, it’s easy to inadvertently force the Afghani population into the
hands of insurgents like the Taliban.
U.S. Needs to Target the Sanctuary
Pakistan Offers to Insurgents
By its failure to deal with the sanctuary
that Pakistan offers to insurgent groups, these insurgent groups can
re-constitute themselves, build their organizations and formulate attacks
inside Afghanistan with impunity. Washington must find a way to disrupt safe
havens inside Pakistan.
The Pakistani government must also halt its
duplicitous actions. Pakistan states that it supports bringing stability to
Afghanistan, but it provides material support and logistics to the Taliban and
the Haqqani network through their intelligence agency, the Inter-Services
Intelligence Directorate (ISI).
Much of the leadership of the Taliban and
the Haqqani network, which the U.S. has been fighting in Afghanistan, resides
on the Pakistan side of the border. The leaders include:
The Taliban’s
Leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada
His deputies,
Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mohammad Yaqub
Senior leaders
like Abdul Qayyum Zakir, Ahmadullah Nanai, Abdul Latif Mansur and Noor Mohammad
Saqib
All of these leaders reside in Pakistan.
There are also a vast number of Taliban and Haqqani foot soldiers living in
Afghanistan, who fight a government they deem corrupt, incompetent and illegitimate.
The Trump administration needs to
reevaluate its strategy toward Pakistan, because the Taliban isn’t strong
enough to take Kabul or overthrow any other major Afghan city. In the same
vein, the Afghan government is too weak to defeat the Taliban on the
battlefield, so the U.S. is in the middle of a political stalemate.
What the US Could Do in Pakistan
In a report by Southeast Asian expert Seth
Jones, Jones suggests that the U.S. apply pressure to Pakistan. The U.S. could
warn the Pakistani government that if they continue to harbour the Taliban and
Haqqani leaders and fail to support the peace process, the United States will
initiate several escalatory steps by:
Providing more public transparency about
Pakistan activities. For example, the U.S. publicly disclose the names of
senior Taliban and Haqqani leaders residing in Pakistan. The U.S. could also
include declassified intelligence – including satellite imagery – of Taliban
locations in Pakistan.
Committing to aggressively pursue U.S.
enemies wherever it finds them. United States forces should be prepared to
target the Taliban, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other groups wherever they
are found — including Pakistan. The United States could directly target the
Taliban and Haqqani network in Pakistan or to surrogates that provide direct or
indirect support to these terror groups.
Continuing to
freeze or terminate most military aid to Pakistan.
Developing
additional alternative routes to bring material to U.S. forces in Afghanistan
through countries like Uzbekistan, which is situated along Afghanistan’s
northern distribution lines.
Suspending or
terminating Pakistan’s status as a non-NATO ally. Non-NATO ally status offers
military and financial advantages that generally are not available to non-NATO
countries.
Making it
more difficult for Islamabad to get access to multilateral financial lenders.
Placing
Pakistan on the U.S. Department of State’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.
U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies have already collected an abundance
of information about Pakistan’s ties to terrorist groups operating in
Afghanistan and India, from Lashkar-e-Taiba (or Jamaat-ud-Dawa) to the Afghan
Taliban and Haqqani network.
Both Pakistan and the United States have
long-term interests in a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. It’s time for the
U.S. to convince Islamabad that peace is in everyone’s interests. Failure will
ensure that the Afghan and Pakistani people will continue to suffer economic
and political hardships.

Title: Taliban call for closure of US bases, prisoner release - World - DAWN.COM
WASHINGTON: Taliban leaders are demanding closure of US bases in Afghanistan and release of hundreds of their prisoners for continuing peace talks with the United States, the US media reported on Saturday.
Zalmay Khalilzad, a former US ambassador recently named as a special adviser for Afghanistan peace talks, arrived in the United Arab Emirates this week for the next round of US-Taliban talks, NBC News reported.
The release of hundreds of Taliban-linked prisoners and the status of US bases in Afghanistan were among the key issues Taliban leaders want to negotiate in US-backed talks to end the war in Afghanistan.
“This meeting with the US authorities would either help pave the way for more meaningful talks or stop them forever,” said one of the four senior Taliban officials who spoke to NBC News.
Other US media outlets, however, reported that the Afghan government was unlikely to concede to the request without a commensurate concession from the Taliban.
“The number of US bases maintained…is also a point of contention; the US wants two, but the Taliban want zero. The Taliban’s main `reason for war, their casus belli, if you will, is the occupation,” retired Col Christopher Kolenda, a former Pentagon adviser who has negotiated with the Taliban, explained in an interview with VOA.

Title: US Strikes Taliban After Group Agrees to Join Moscow Talks – Afghan Lawmaker - 20.09.2018, Sputnik International
"Daesh* militants have become very active in northern Afghanistan recently, rather than the Taliban*, because the United States strikes the latter, but does not touch the former ones. The Taliban members are often offered to surrender to the Afghan government forces or persuaded to join DAesh, provide their assistance to it … Large-scale operations are now being carried out against the Taliban in northern Afghanistan because the Taliban agreed to participate in this [Moscow format] meeting," Aimaq said.

Title: US Forces in Afghanistan Target IS Leader
By Ayesha Tanzeem September 02, 2018
U.S. forces in Afghanistan say they targeted and killed the leader of Islamic State Khorasan Province last month in eastern Afghanistan.
ISKP is the branch of IS operating in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the vicinity.
Abu Sayeed Bajaur, also known as Abu Saad Orakzai, is the third ISKP leader killed by coalition forces in the past two years.
The announcement came Sunday, when a new U.S. commander took charge of the NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan. General Scott Miller said a vital part of his mission in Afghanistan is to keep the country from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups.
"America and her allies are in Afghanistan to maintain pressure on the networked, trans-regional terrorists attempting to plot, resource and direct attacks from here," he said.
While ISKP has been facing pressure in Afghanistan and the area under its direct control has been reduced by increased U.S. air strikes, including dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb called a Massive Ordinance Air Blast last year, it has managed to carry out more brazen attacks in various parts of the country.
Last month, a deadly attack in a Shi'ite neighborhood killed dozens of students giving university entrance exam. Shiites have been frequent targets of ISKP in Afghanistan.
In 2017, Nangarhar, parts of which have been an ISKP stronghold since 2015, proved to be the deadliest place on earth for the U.S. forces. This was where they lost one third of the 21 U.S. service members killed in battle that year.
Despite the violence, General John Nicholson, who handed over command to General Miller, insisted the group is not growing.
"They have been able to replenish a portion of their losses by recruiting from other violent extremist organizations," he said in an email statement to VOA. "Despite this recruiting, they are losing fighters and losing ground."

Title: Unprecedented: Afghanistan Deports Man to India for Trying to Join Islamic State
Afghanistan, in a move described as unprecedented by some Indian media outlets this week, deported a 26-year-old man back to his native country of India for trying to join the South Asian wing of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).
TheIndian Expressnotedon Thursday that Nashidul Hamzafar traveled to Afghanistan in October 2017 through the Gulf to join ISIS, but Afghan security agencies thwarted his plans.
New Delhi’s counterterrorism arm known as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) reportedly took Hamzafar into custody upon his arrival from Kabul.
Late last year, theHindureportedthat ISIS hadintensifiedits recruiting efforts inIndia.
On Wednesday, Hamzafar reportedly faced a special court for NIA cases. Authorities are holding the defendant without bail.
In a statement, the NIA revealed, Hamzafar “was detained by Afghan Security Agencies last year for illegally entering the country to join his associates in proscribed terrorist organization ISIS/Daish.”
The Indian counterterrorism agency accused the detainee of participating in a conspiracy involving “14 accused persons from Kasaragod district [who] had left India or their workplaces in Middle-East between mid-May and early-July, 2016 before traveling to Afghanistan, where they joined ISIS/Daish.”
According to theOneindia.comnews outlet, “The case relates to the criminal conspiracy hatched by the accused persons from Kasaragod district of Kerala and their associates since Ramadan, 2015 with the intention of joining and furthering the objectives of ISIS.”
Citing unnamed officials, India’s NDTVdescribedthe extradition of the Indian national from Afghanistan over ISIS links as unprecedented.
“It is the first extradition of alleged ISIS sympathizer from Afghanistan, the officials said,” NDTV reported.
NDTV learned that Hamzafar left India on October 3, 2017, and traveled to Oman and Iran before reaching Kabul where security forces arrested him.
Iran shares a border with Afghanistan. The ISIS wing in South Asia is known as theKhorasanprovince. Khorasan is theancient namefor a region that covers parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, and other neighboring countries.

Afghanistan deports ISIS sympathiser, 14 others from Kerala: NIA
In a first, Afghanistan has deported an alleged ISIS sympathiser from Kerala, Nashidul Hamzafar, who along with 14 other youths had gone to join the terror organisation, officials said.
They said he was taken into custody by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on arrival from Kabul.
"Nashidul was detained by Afghan security agencies last year for illegally entering the country to join his associates in proscribed terrorist organisation ISIS/Daish," the agency's spokesperson said in a statement.
It is the first extradition of alleged ISIS sympathiser from Afghanistan, the officials said.
It is alleged that Hamzafar, a resident of Kasaragod in Kerala, along with his associates, had left the country on October 3, 2017 and travelled to Muscat, Oman before travelling to Iran and further reaching Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was detained.
"Pursuant to the conspiracy, 14 accused persons from Kasaragod district had left India or their work places in the Middle East between mid-May and early-July, 2016 before travelling to Afghanistan, where they joined ISIS/Daish," he said.RelatedStoriesKabul: 25, including journalists, killed in twin blasts; ISIS claims responsibilityGovt bans new offshoots of Al-Qaeda, ISIS; both declared 'unlawful' for radicalising Indian youthsNIA arrests two Hyderabadi youths for ISIS linksISIS man jailed for life over terror plot to assassinate Theresa May

Title: Kerala ISIS recruit deported from Afghanistan, to be grilled by NIA
Listen to Story
In a first, a 26-year-old terror suspect from Kerala, Nashidul Hamzafar, has been deported from Afghanistan for questioning. Nashidul spent a year in Afghanistan to join ISIS. On Tuesday, Afghan authorities put Nashidul on a plane to Delhi, where NIA officials were waiting for him.
Soon after Nashidul passed the immigration, he was arrested and produced before the NIA special court in Patiala House court complex.
Alok Mittal Inspector General (IG), NIA confirmed the news about Nashidul's arrest. "He will now be taken to Kochi on transit remand for producing him before the special NIA court, Ernakulam that had issued NBW against him," he said.
The arrest is a shot in the arm for the agency which claims this is the first deportation of terror suspect in any case from Afghanistan. Nashidul was detained by Afghan security agencies last year for illegally entering the country from the Afghanistan-Iran border before reaching Kabul.
For NIA, Nashidul Hamzafar is a goldmine of information since he is the first active terrorist with key link to the sensational 2016 ISIS case. 21 Kerala natives went missing in 2016 fleeing to Afghanistan only to join ISIS. At least 3-4 of the 21 peopole are believed to be killed.
Nashidul Hamzafar, a native of Kalpetta, Wayanad district, left a year later but was in touch with people who fled in 2016.
Sources said that when the Afghanistan agencies got a wind of him, he was tracked and detained. He was questioned by both Afghan and US intelligence agencies.
Once, it became clear that Nashidul, had come to Afghanistan to join ISIS, the agencies deported him to India.
Nashidul is the only ISIS terror recruit from India who spent several months in Afghanistan traveling through several routes and meeting contacts.
According to the anti-terror probe agency, Nashidul had left India on October 3, 2017 and traveled to Muscat, Oman before travelling to Iran and further reaching Kabul, where he was detained.
"He could be a key link to the missing Indians. He seemed to be in touch with several ISIS terrorist through social media platforms. He can reveal a great extent about the missing Indians and possibly even those who have not been detected."
Nashidul used encrypted social media platforms to communicate with other absconding accused persons in this case. The others, Abdul Rashid Abdulla and Ashfak Majeed, were known to him through his college mates Shihas, Firoz Khan and Bestin Vincent.
The first crucial arrest in the case was Yasmeen Mohammed Zahid who attempted to migrate to IS-held territory in Afghanistan. She was awarded seven years of rigorous imprisonmen earlier this year.Published By:Ekta HandaPublished On:Sep 19, 2018--- ENDS ---

Title: Afghan officials deport Kerala man who illegally entered country to join ISIS
A 26-year-old man from Kerala was deported by officials in Afghanistan after he had illegally entered the country to join the Islamic State (ISIS). He was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) at Delhi airport.
The accused, who has been identified as Nashidul Hamzafar, had been working in the United Arab Emirates and had last come to India in 2017. He traveled to Muscat on a tourist visa, with a friend in October and from there, he alone went to Iran through unguarded border points, according to mediareports.
“The NIA arrested Nashidul Hamzafar after he was deported to New Delhi from Kabul, Afghanistan. Nashidul was detained by Afghan security agencies last year for illegally entering the country to join his associates in proscribed terrorist organisation ISIS/Daish,” the NIA said in an official statement.
Hamzafar, a native of Kerala’s Kalpetta in Wayanad district, was allegedly in touch with many others who had left Kerala and were living in ISIS controlled Afghanistan, and had been influenced by them.
In 2016, twenty-one individuals from Kerala had travelled to Afghanistan via Iran and currently live in ISIS-headed territories. Hamzafar reportedly was in touch with a few of them and was planning to join the Islamic State. He allegedly obtained their contacts through “encrypted social media platforms” and through college friends.
The Islamic State hadallegedlyrecruited well-educated members from Kasargod, who then left India to live in Afghanistan.
Last year, Afghan authorities detained Hamzafar after he was found to have illegally entered the country in order to join ISIS, according to the NIA.
A special court for NIA cases looked at this case on Wednesday in New Delhi. Hamzafar is now being taken to Kochi to be produced before a special NIA court which had issued a warrant against him.

Title: Persisting Threat Of ISIS: Insurgencies Transform And Transmit Despite Success Or Failure On Battlefield – Analysis – Eurasia Review
A Journal of Analysis and News

ByDr. Manoj Kumar Mishra
The intervening powers in Syria would do well by reading into the unfolding developments in Iraq that even while the American-supported Iraqi regime could defeat the insurgency on the battlefield by rolling back the influence of pro-Saddam forces and Al Qaeda with the assistance of Sunni groups including anti-Saddam forces, the hydra-headed ISIS sprang up and quickly replaced Al Qaeda when the intervening power fanned Sunni disillusionment by reserving key governmental ministries and posts for the Shia sect.
The ISIS emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi pointed to the unprecedented bouncing back capacity of the group when he said that the jihadi group could be able to mobilize more than 60 thousand fighters in Iraq from more than a hundred countries to its cause when a surge in US troops’ operations in 2007 downsized the group to only about a thousand fighters (R. Wright, ISIS Makes a Comeback –as Trump Opts to Stay in Syria”, The New Yorker, August 30, 2018, Available athttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/isis-makes-a-comebackas-trump-opts-to-stay-in-syria).
Although the US-led coalition forces have made an announcement that they are fighting the last phase of war against ISIS in Hajin – a desert terrain along the Euphrates River’s east bank and an area claimed to be the last retreat for the group, some US officials have acknowledged that ISIS is also active in other areas such as in the south of the Euphrates River and near the city of Palmyra – areas under the control of Assad regime and out of an effective-reach of US-led coalition troops.
As per some US intelligence reports-which remained ambivalent as to the strength and number of the group  and reports from the UN suggest the group remained resilient in rural pockets and border areas of Iraq and Syria even though the American-led forces may have liquidated the group in urban strongholds in Mosul and Raqqa. A report from a UN panel of experts noted: “ISIS has up to 30,000 members roughly distributed between Syria and Iraq and its global network poses a rising threat.” (Bad News: ISIS Has Just as Many Fighters in Iraq and Syria As It Did 4 years Ago”, The National Interest, August 15, 2018, Available athttps://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/bad-news-isis-has-just-many-fighters-iraq-and-syria-it-did-4-years-ago-28812).
The reports also came up with a caveat that notwithstanding “ISIS’s battlefield losses, the core will survive with support from countries such as Afghanistan, Libya, Southeast Asia and West Africa” (Ibid).
The factors that contributed to resilience of ISIS in Syria until the US proclaimed the last phase of fighting the group out of Syria that started in May 2018 notwithstanding a multipronged challenge to its survival from American, Russian, Iranian and Turkish forces can be explained by the anarchic socio-economic and political conditions that the US, Russia and Iran contributed to either by supporting the rebel forces as the US has done or by seeking to prevent the Assad regime from falling despite its despotic character as the Russians and Iranians have done.
It is worthwhile to mention that the US was engaged in supporting moderate Islamic groups with arms and aid under the rubric of ‘Arab spring’ to unseat despotic regimes from power. In this context, the Syrian rebel groups not only received official support from the American leadership to fight ISIS in the form of ‘train and equip’ program, the CIA was allegedly involved in covert operations running into billions of American dollars to unseat the Assad regime from power. The Russian military involvement in Syrian war in 2015 rolled back the gains that the rebel groups achieved and the Assad regime is now poised to acquire the territories lost to the rebels. However, going by the Iraqi example, there is high probability that the anger and disillusionment of the rebels would find a way out by channelizing these negative feelings and energies towards support for ISIS.
While the geopolitical gambits between the US-led coalitions on the one hand and the Russians and Iranians on the other are very much on in Syria with Idlib serving as the bastion for their competition, the question that assumes significance is how far the fight against ISIS in Syria would go in destroying the roots and vitality of this group.
The American drive against terror groups has so far engendered mixed results as liquidation of one group has given birth to another group as in the case of Al Qaeda’s liquidation leading to the rise of ISIS. The members regroup and emerge from another location with a new avatar or the members of the groups after defecting from one group get recruited by another group, learn from each others’ modus operandi, share arms and ammunitions and raise their funds from coordinated illegal drugs and arms trade. It is germane to note that the foothold of ISIS has already expanded to other adjacent regions where the state institutions remain weak and fragile. Similarly, even while the Assad regime supported by Russia and Iran seems poised to retake lost territories by defeating rebels but that is not likely to end insurgency.
Faced with serious fights in Iraq and Syria, ISIS looked for other countries ridden with sectarian conflicts and grievances against intervening power and Afghanistan appeared being most suitable on these counts. ISIS spread into the law-less areas of Afghanistan reportedly following the death of Mullah Omar – the leader of and stabilizing force within the Taliban. Even since the group has been able to strengthen its presence in Af-Pak border areas and spread its presence and influence into other areas with passage of time.
While several news reports maintained that the ranks of ISIS continued to bloat with foreign fighters escaping from Syria, Iraq and members from Central Asian countries, the US-led forces quite in tune with their success stories against the group in Iraq and Syria have underplayed the threat posed by ISIS by maintaining that the influence of ISIS in Afghanistan was limited to a few provinces such as Nangarhar and Kunar in the east and Jowzjan in north of Afghanistan and that the group consisted of only local defectors numbering around 1500 from other militant groups. (“US Military Rejects Russian Claims About Number of IS Fighters in Afghanistan”, VOA News, February 24, 2018, Available athttps://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-rejects-russia-numbers-of-islamic-state-fighters-in-afghanistan/4268999.html).
Russia based on its intelligence information has expressed its concerns that ISIS has an enhanced presence of ISIS in Afghanistan with around 10,000 fighters spread across eight to nine provinces including its influence in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan along the Pakistani border and in the northern province of Jowzjan which shares a border with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan carrying a dangerous portent for the Central Asian states. China, Pakistan and Iran share Russian heightened threat perceptions from ISIS in Afghanistan (“Pakistan, Iran, China, Russia Agree to Carry out Joint Efforts against ISIS”, The Nation, July 13, 2018, Available athttps://nation.com.pk/13-Jul-2018/pakistan-iran-china-russia-agree-to-carry-out-joint-efforts-against-isis).
Beijing seems to be alarmed at the possibility that ISIS in Afghanistan might be able to recruit many Uighurs from its restive Xinjiang province as around 5000 ethnic Uighurs belonging to the Muslim minority community reportedly joined ISIS call for jihad in Syria. (B. Blanchard, “Syria says up to 5,000 Chinese Uighurs fighting in militant groups”, Reuters, May 11, 2017, Available athttps://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-china/syria-says-up-to-5000-chinese-uighurs-fighting-in-militant-groups-idUSKBN1840UP).
Despite American-led forces’ attempts at downplaying ISIS threat in Afghanistan, the group has claimed responsibility for most of the despicable and horrendous terrorist attacks apart from more frequent but less highlighted attacks on the Afghan soil. For instance, there were successive terror attacks in Kabul on April 30, 2018 which reportedly took lives of more than forty civilians including journalists and children. (“Pompeo condemns terror bombings in Afghanistan”, May 1, 2018, Available athttps://www.yahoo.com/news/latest-least-4-killed-kabul-blasts-042124456.html).
These strikes followed closely on the heels of a spate of serious attacks a week before in which more than sixty civilians were killed while they lined up to register to vote for the upcoming elections (Afghanistan: 63 dead in Attacks on voter registration centres”, Aljazeera news, April 22, 2018, Available athttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/afghanistan-deaths-attack-id-voter-registration-centre-kabul-180422063114761.html).  Terrorist offensives by the group in the Afghan city of Jalalabad killed 19 people including 17 persons from Sikh and Hindu communities on July 1, 2018 (Afghan Sikhs, Hindus grieve after suicide attack kills 19”, The Tribune, July 2, 2018, Available athttps://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/afghan-sikhs-hindus-grieve-after-suicide-attack-kills-19/613933.html).
Attacks on August 15, 2018 claimed lives of more than forty eight young people among which 34 were students belonging to the Shiite minority sect who were preparing for university entrance exams (“Suicide bomber kills 48 in Kabul as students prepare for University exams”, Independent, 15 August 2018, Available athttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kabul-suicide-bomb-students-death-toll-latest-shiite-isis-dead-a8493526.html).
However, the attacks perpetrated by the group made concerted efforts at spreading anarchy by undermining the nascent democratic and peace process in Afghanistan with targeting potential voters and religious minorities. The car bomb attack on a gathering of the Taliban and Afghan forces united to celebrate Eid ceasefire between June 15 and 17 which claimed at least 26 lives and left several others wounded in the eastern province of Nangarhar could have no other objective except sabotaging the peace process and spread lawlessness in Afghanistan which could only provide the group with the ability to spread its radical ideology and recruit emotionally-tormented people (R. Jain, Q. Sediqi, “Afghanistan Eid car bomb, claimed by Islamic State, kills 26”, Reuters, June 16, Available athttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-taliban/afghanistan-eid-car-bomb-claimed-by-islamic-state-kills-26-idUSKBN1JC044).
The US-led forces displayed tremendous resoluteness in unseating despotic regimes like the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam of Iraq and in the similar fashion, the Iranian and Russian forces exhibited remarkable consistency in bolstering the Assad regime but what they are seemingly unable to provide is stable alternatives which would bring stability in these societies deeply divided along sectarian lines.
As the war and peace efforts have not been able to deliver on stability in Afghanistan and the Trump Administration has indicated that the US may not be interested in post-conflict state-building efforts in Syria, pertinent questions still remain as regards the American and other powers’ will and capacity to address the problem of terrorism in real terms. Intervening powers in order to take on terrorism to its last must work towards providing for a stable state with normal socio-economic functions in Afghanistan as well as Syria.

Title: In A First, Afghanistan Deports Kerala Man With Alleged ISIS Links
The man was taken into custody by  NIA upon arrival from Kabul. (Representational)
In a first, Afghanistan has deported an alleged ISIS sympathiser from Kerala, who along with 14 other who had gone to join the terror organisation, officials said. The man was taken into custody by the National Investigation Agency on arrival from Kabul.
"Nashidul was detained by Afghan security agencies last year for illegally entering the country to join his associates in proscribed terrorist organisation ISIS/Daish," the agency's spokesperson said in a statement.
It is the first extradition of alleged ISIS sympathiser from Afghanistan, the officials said.

It is alleged that Hamzafar, a resident of Kasaragod in Kerala, along with his associates, had left the country on October 3, 2017 and travelled to Oman and Iran before reaching Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was detained.
"Pursuant to the conspiracy, 14 accused persons from Kasaragod district had left India or their work places in the Middle East between mid-May and early-July, 2016 before travelling to Afghanistan, where they joined ISIS/Daish," he said.
The agency has alleged Hamzafar participated in the conspiracy through encrypted social media platforms and knew the other accused through his college friends.

Title: Civilian Casualties:  A Multi-Purpose Insurgency Tool  - The Daily Outlook Afghanistan, print and online English Newspaper
Civilian  casualties are a tragic reality of counter-insurgency campaigns in Afghanistan.  There have always been debates at the policy level about the degree of risk  commanders of counterinsurgency forces should assume in an effort to protect  civilians from harm. Further, it is a major concern that counterinsurgent  forces bear the cost for civilian casualties even when they are caused by  insurgent groups. Unfortunately, civilian casualties have been rising since  2009 in Afghanistan. As a result, in the first half of 2018, 1,413 civilians  have been killed and injured in suicide and complex attacks in Afghanistan.  According to the UNAMA mid-year assessment Report, more civilians have been  killed in the first six months of 2018 than in any year since 2009 when UNAMA started  systematic monitoring. Nangarhar and Kabul provinces have witnessed the most  civilian casualties and they have been the top target of the ISKH and terrorist  groups.However, preventing Civilian casualties  have been one of the top goals of the Afghan government and the international  community; however, the Afghan and government and the international community  not only have not been able to decrease and manage this critical issue but  Afghanistan witnessed an unprecedented rise in civilian casualties.Why is it so difficult to Prevent Civilian  Casualties?Insurgents in Afghanistan hide inside of  the populace. When this happens, civilians die when The ANSF or the  International Community forces fight them. In such case, it doesn’t matter how  much training, how restrictive the rules of engagement are, or even how small  of a presence the occupying power may have. Civilian deaths are part of the  collateral damage of war.Policies and practices to minimize  civilian harmMilitary experts believe civilian harm –  death, injury and damage to property – can be avoided or minimized through many  different methods. Choosing an appropriate weapons system, munitions warhead  fuse and delivery system; considering the distance from which a weapon is  launched; and the angle and timing of the attack all potentially affect the  level of civilian harm inflicted. These new practices and policies when  implemented strengthen adherence to the principles of proportionality,  precaution and distinction. These practices and policies should be shared with  armed actors and adjusted to different theatres and capabilities.Summing up the topic, the relationship  between civilian casualties and violent incidents in Afghanistan is  characterized by three important facts: (1) there is a positive relationship  between civilian casualties and levels of future violence in an area and that  relationship is much stronger for NATO-caused civilian casualties. (2) Civilian  casualties affect the long-run trends in violence, not short-term fluctuations.  (3) The relationship between civilian casualties and violence does not appear  to spill over district boundaries.Preventing civilian casualties is a  critical challenge before the Afghan government and the NATO forces. This has  put the Afghan government and the international community under mounting  pressures and criticisms of the people, Human Rights Organizations and Human  Rights activists. It acts as a catalyst to help the insurgents to recruit from  the communities as their anger and dissatisfaction grows against the government  and the international community.  The  last but not the least, in closing, as much as we wish we could completely  eliminates civilian casualties from warfare, or warfare all together, it is  ultimately impossible. Even with the most advanced technology available.  However, it can be minimized and all the measures shall be taken to put it in  practice.

Title: The Newest Wave of Taliban Attacks in Northern Afghanistan – The Organization for World Peace
On September 10, the Taliban carried out multiple attacks in Northern Afghanistan, killing at least 52 Afghan security forces. As the latest violence to plague the country, the Taliban attacked police checkpoints in four northern provinces: Kunduz, Jawzjan, Samangan, and Sari Pul. Although United States officials have been meeting directly with Taliban leaders the past couple months for peace negotiations, attacks have only been becoming bigger and more frequent. The Taliban currently control the most Afghan territory than any other point since the 2001 US invasion.
According to a BBC study, the Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan. The recent series of attacks is part of a shift towards directing attacks on Afghan military bases and checkpoints. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have been suffering heavy losses in their struggle to hold off Taliban insurgents. In the attacks on security checkpoints in Kunduz, Samangan and Sari Pul, provincial police chiefs and spokesmen reported deaths on Afghan security forces and other pro-government militia.
In the Jawzjan province, the Taliban attacked the Khamyab district. Afghan forces had to withdraw from the area because “there was intense fighting and we didn’t want civilian houses destroyed, or any civilian casualties,” said Provincial Police Chief Gen. Faqir Mohammad Jawzjani. This led to Khamyab being the latest district to fall to Taliban control. The Taliban insurgents also gained ground in Sari Pul, where, as stated by police spokesman Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, “reinforcements were on their way to the area when they came under Taliban ambush, and security forces abandoned their base when they did not receive reinforcements.”
The new US strategy in Afghanistan that began in 2017 included a dramatic increase in airstrikes and has been criticized for causing an unprecedented level of civilian casualties, so the decision in Jawzjan to withdraw in order to prevent unnecessary casualties is commendable. The increased attacks from the Taliban suggests a need for more Afghan reinforcements and retaliation, but after 17 years of fighting, it’s clear that military action alone won’t solve anything. While it is necessary to engage the Taliban when they carry out attacks, to actually reach a conclusion to this conflict the focus needs to be on working towards a peace negotiation.
An opportunity for peace talks occurred during an unprecedented three-day ceasefire in June in observance of Eid, followed by a meeting between the Taliban and US officials. However, Taliban leaders were angered by images of Taliban and Afghan soldiers getting along during the ceasefire, responding with an increase in attacks. A few days before the attacks in the northern provinces, there wereadditional Taliban raidson district centers and a suicide bomber attack at a rally in Kabul where people were mourning the anniversary of the death of an anti-Taliban leader. Also, aBBC reportsuggested that the increase in Taliban attacks could be because of upcoming peace talks and that the Taliban want to be able to come to the negotiations with the most leverage and power possible.
The recent Taliban attacks in Northern Afghanistan are evidence that the war going on for 17 years has not slowed down. Attempts to solve this conflict with military force have not been successful and the Taliban are still as strong as ever. Negotiations between both sides are needed to determine the future of the country. One challenge to peace talks is that there are so many outside actors involved in this conflict, from the United States to Russia and China and many more.Barnett Rubin, a former senior advisor for the US Department of State and leading expert on Afghanistan and South Asia, has written that “the main players in the conflict have seen hardly any possibility of joint gains from peace…because each actor tends to believe that its adversaries have no feasible proposal and are using talks to buy time.” Rubin suggests that the different actors need to develop a sense of trust and be willing to compromise in their negotiations, but also that infrastructure investment and connectivity projects would make Afghanistan more economically independent and could be a way to push the country in a more peaceful direction.

Title:   Tue. 8:38 a.m.: Rights groups warn against US flouting international court | News, Sports, Jobs - Tribune Chronicle
Sep 11, 2018
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghan rights workers warned today that the U.S. national security adviser’s blistering attack on the International Criminal Court investigating war crimes allegations will strengthen a climate of impunity in Afghanistan, prolong the war and embolden those carrying out acts of violence.
In a speech Monday, John Bolton said Washington would not cooperate with The Hague-based court and threatened it with sanctions, saying it put U.S. sovereignty and national security at risk.
War crimes allegations in Afghanistan include those allegedly committed by the CIA and U.S. forces.
“It’s very unfortunate because delivering justice to victims will help to facilitate the peace process in Afghanistan,”said Sima Samar, head of Afghanistan’s Human Right’s Commission, today.“Justice is not a luxury. It is a basic human right.”
During a three-month period that ended in January, the International Criminal Court received a staggering 1.7 million allegations of war crimes from Afghanistan, although some involved entire villages alleging a war crime.
Still, thousands of individual statements as well as statements filed on behalf of multiple victims, were received by the ICC in The Hague. The statements were collected by organizations based in Europe and Afghanistan and sent to the court.
Bolton’s speech came as an ICC judge was expected to soon announce a decision on a request from prosecutors to formally open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces, Taliban and Haqqani network militants as well as U.S. forces and intelligence officials in Afghanistan since May 2003.
The 181-page prosecution request, dated November 2017, said“information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that members of United States of America (US) armed forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the 2003-2004 period.”
Washington’s unequivocal rejection of the court seems likely to embolden Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government, which refused today to respond directly to Bolton’s outburst, but similarly dismissed war crimes allegations against Afghan National Security Forces as well as its intelligence agency.
President Ashraf Ghani’s deputy spokesman, Shahussain Murtazawi, said the Taliban, the Islamic State group affiliate and as many as 21 other anti-government groups are the perpetrators of war crimes. He dismissed allegations against security forces saying“government forces are always trying to save the people. It is the insurgents who are the killers of civilians.”
Yet the prosecutor’s request says there is“a reasonable basis to believe that members of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), in particular members of the National Directorate for Security (NDS) and the Afghan National Police (ANP), have engaged in systemic patterns of torture and cruel treatment of conflict-related detainees in Afghan detention facilities, including acts of sexual violence.”

Title: Rights Groups Warn Against US Flouting International Court Over Alleged War Crimes - TPM – Talking Points Memo
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghan rights workers warned Tuesday that the U.S. national security adviser’s blistering attack on the International Criminal Court investigating war crimes allegations will strengthen a climate of impunity in Afghanistan, prolong the war and embolden those carrying out acts of violence.
In a speech Monday, John Bolton said Washington would not cooperate with The Hague-based court and threatened it with sanctions, saying it put U.S. sovereignty and national security at risk.
War crimes allegations in Afghanistan include those allegedly committed by the CIA and U.S. forces.
“It’s very unfortunate because delivering justice to victims will help to facilitate the peace process in Afghanistan,” said Sima Samar, head of Afghanistan’s Human Right’s Commission, on Tuesday. “Justice is not a luxury. It is a basic human right.”
Bolton’s speech came as an ICC judge was expected to soon announce a decision on a request from prosecutors to formally open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces, Taliban and Haqqani network militants as well as U.S. forces and intelligence officials in Afghanistan since May 2003.
The 181-page prosecution request, dated November 2017, said “information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that members of United States of America (US) armed forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the 2003-2004 period.”

Still, thousands of individual statements as well as statements filed on behalf of multiple victims, were received by the ICC in The Hague. The statements were collected by organizations based in Europe and Afghanistan and sent to the court.
For human rights activists in Afghanistan, Bolton’s assault dealt a punishing blow to their relentless efforts to end a culture of impunity that has bedeviled efforts to bring perpetrators of crimes to justice.
“The solution to put an end to war is by making everyone accountable, whether it is the Taliban or the Haqqani network or whether it is the Americans or the Afghan army or Afghan government,” said Ehsan Qaane, of the Kabul-based Transitional Justice Coordination Group, which represents 26 organizations working for transitional justice in Afghanistan.
The coordination group assisted many victims who wanted to file a claim with the international court.
Victims need to see justice done if they are to begin to heal, said Qaane. He said some insurgents turned to the Taliban after being picked up, tortured and released. Their fight is more about revenge than ideology, he said.
“These people will perhaps stop fighting if they feel they have justice,” said Qaane.
In The Hague, the ICC simply stated it was aware of Bolton’s comments. In a statement issued Tuesday it did not address Bolton directly but rather reiterated its mission and that it was supported by 123 countries who have signed on to the Rome Statute that created the court. Afghanistan is a signatory.
Samar said rights groups cannot dispense justice.
“There is a difference between a human rights defender and a judge,” thus the need for the ICC, she said in a telephone interview. “My concern is that to deny justice is to deny a basic human right and human dignity.”

So when the next US citizen or soldier is tortured by someone elsewhere in the world, we’ll have to say, “Yeah, we’re OK with that, everybody does it.”
Bush2, Cheney,. Yoo… Who else rightly at risk? The hypocrisy of the USA is astounding but not unexpected.
Just like with Watergate and Iran/Contra, if the highest levels are not held accountable, it will only get worse.
American war crimes are as American as apple pie.
John Bolton himself is one of the main beneficiaries of this policy.
But Obama did not see fit to prosecute war crimes, so these clowns are still running loose.

Title: Jalaluddin Haqqani Is Dead But the Infrastructure That He Put In Place Is Very Much Alive | Kriti Shah | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam


By Kriti Shah
10 September 2018
It’s worrisome that even though Jalaluddin
Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani Network, is now dead, the infrastructure
that he put in place is very much alive
Jalaluddin Haqqani, the 71-year-old Islamic
militant, who first fought in the Soviet jihad in the 1908s and founded one of
the world’s most notorious terror organisations, is now dead. His family-run
transnational jihadi organisation, known as the Haqqani Network, had provided
support and sustenance to the groups such as Al Qaeda, Taliban and
Lashkar-e-Tayyeba for decades.
Born in the Paktia Province of Afghanistan,
Haqqani rose to notoriety during the 1980s as a guerrilla fighter against the
Soviet rule in Afghanistan. Mujahedeen fighters that were backed by the United
States were provided with logistical and financial support in their ‘holy’
fight against the Soviet Union. One US Congressman went to the extent of
praising Haqqani as man who was “goodness personified”. After the withdrawal of
the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, foreign funding was sharply abated, and
Haqqani, who had served as the top commander for Hizb-e-Islami Gulbuddin Khalis
(HiK), established and began to run a number of profitable madrasas in
Afghanistan and Pakistan’s bordering tribal areas.
When the Taliban came to power in 1994, he
was quick to form an alliance with the group, ceding power to Mullah Omar and
setting up the Haqqani Network’s new base in north Waziristan, Pakistan. The
Taliban, impressed with his military prowess, named him Minister of Borders and
Tribal Affairs — a role that suited Haqqani’s expertise perfectly as well as
further emboldened his position.
While the Taliban provided ideological guidance
to the militant Islamists, Haqqani provided the military manpower. The network
raised funds through kidnappings, extortion, taxing and smuggling of weapons
and drugs across the border, enriching themselves during the lawless years of
the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. By building strategic ties with the Taliban
and the Al Qaeda, it expanded its operational capabilities to a number of
Provinces in Afghanistan — setting up a number of bases across eastern and
southern Afghanistan and occupying key territory outside Kabul. Later, Haqqani
also partnered with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, expanding his network’s
operational reach to the northern areas of Afghanistan. Through brokered deals
with large and small militant groups, he developed a large area of influence
across the Durand Line. The Haqqani’s jihad business set the ground
infrastructure for a complex criminal-political nexus, the source of South
Asian jihad.
With the US invasion of Afghanistan in
2001, Haqqani refused to side with his past allies, the United States. He
refused to surrender the Taliban and Al Qaeda leadership. As the US troops
entered Afghanistan and thousands of militants fled across the border to
Pakistan, Haqqani provided the leadership with protection and safe-havens. With
dismal governance in Pakistan’s tribal areas, this was fairly easy. Haqqani was
able to lure and recruit poor, displaced and disenfranchised young men to fight
in the war, helping in fuelling the fight against the US troops. This made him
the Taliban’s most reliable ally. They actively required the Haqqani network of
safe-havens, camps of trained fighters, and supply of weapons to fight the US.
His good relationship with local insurgent groups helped in the movement of
militants and weapons across the border, fuelling what has now been a
17-year-long war.
The Haqqani Network has been the
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) preferred insurgent group when it comes to
Pakistani ‘establishment’ plans for Afghanistan. Its territorial control over
the Afghan south-east is a much-desired ‘strategic depth’ that Pakistan seeks
vis-à-vis India. The group continues to enjoy significant influence and support
of members of the Pakistani military, often acting as ‘peace brokers’, helping
the Government negotiate with other militant groups in the region.
Today, the Haqqanis operate as a
semi-autonomous group from the Taliban. The group’s legacy is one of launching
large-scale, high-target attacks in Kabul and elsewhere, using suicide bombers,
vehicles and large improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The attacks on the
Serena Hotel in 2008, Intercontinental Hotel and US Embassy in 2011, have all
been attributed to the work of the Haqqani Network. Jalaluddin’s insistence on
publicising the attacks was to generate media exposure that casts doubt on the
ability of Western powers to provide stability and security.
Today, the group, which has been operating
under the leadership of Jalaluddin’s son Sirajuddin for the past decade, has
been able to maintain its role as one of the most significant political and
military actor on the battlefield. The diversity of the Haqqani’s business
operations, its partnerships with transnational terrorist networks and its
illicit fund raising techniques, have made the group network central to the
Afghan conflict. Jalaluddin Haqqani is now declared dead but the infrastructure
that he put in place over the past three decades is still intact and very much
alive.

Title: Peace in Afghanistan: US Must Formulate A Strategy That Deals Directly With The Taliban And The Haqqani Network’s Sanctuary Inside Pakistan | John Ubaldi | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam


By John Ubaldi
September 19, 2018
The famous philosopher George Santayana
famously quoted, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.” This statement particularly applies to the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
The U.S. recently commemorated the 9/11
terror attacks that precipitated our involvement in Afghanistan. But since
2001, the United States has been unable to deal with the insurgent activity
inside Pakistan.
The Strength of an Insurgency
Whenever an insurgent group like the
Taliban enjoys a sanctuary inside a neighbouring country, they will either win
or drag out the conflict. If the United States is to be successful in bringing
stability to Afghanistan, it must place a significant amount of pressure on the
Taliban and Haqqani network inside Pakistan and stop Islamabad’s support for
these terrorist organizations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford recently traveled to
Pakistan. They sought to persuade Islamabad to stop supporting proxy forces
inside Afghanistan and start supporting the peace process.
Since the U.S. military intervention into
Afghanistan, Pakistan has become a safe haven for the Taliban and other Islamic
terror groups who operate with impunity, all under the watchful eye of
Islamabad. Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was even allowed to escape
across the border following the U.S. military incursion.
Trump: Time to Hold Pakistan Accountable
In the summer of 2017, President Trump
remarked that “Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and
terror.” This past New Year’s Day, Trump tweeted that the United States has
“Foolishly given Pakistan more than $33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15
years” with little in return, promising “No more!”
Days before Pompeo’s and Dunford’s visit to
Pakistan, the United States placed added pressure on Islamabad. The federal
government announced the cancelation of a $300 billion military aid package,
which had coincided with a broader revocation of aid this past January.
So far, the Trump administration has not
been successful in getting Pakistan to change its behaviour. Similarly, former
president George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were stymied by Pakistan.
Why Has the US
Experienced a Lack of Success in Afghanistan?
Various reasons
hinder the ability of the U.S. to bring stability to Afghanistan. These reasons
include:
The lack of
effective Afghan governance at the regional level
The over-focus
on military tactics
The Taliban’s
ability to secure resources from foreign donors and the drug trade
The sanctuary
that Pakistan offers to the Taliban
Seth G. Jones, Senior Adviser to the
International Security Program at the Centre for International Studies,
reported that “The Taliban’s senior Shura (also called the Rahbari Shura or
leadership council) continues to reside in Pakistan, as do the Taliban’s
regional Shuras that support the Afghan war. In addition, Pakistan’s
Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) still provides sanctuary and
aid to groups like the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network that are fighting the
United States and its allies in Afghanistan.”
What the US Should Do to Bring Peace to
Afghanistan
For the United States to be successful in
bringing peace to Afghanistan, it must move beyond the tactical approach and
formulate a strategic strategy that deals directly with the Taliban and the
Haqqani network’s sanctuary inside Pakistan. If this strategy is not created,
the U.S. will just replicate the mistakes of the past 17 years.
To turn the conflict around, U.S. leaders
should remember the axiom articulated by military expert and Prussian general
Carl Von Clausewitz in his famous military treatise, “On War.” Von Clausewitz
defined “the Centre of Gravity,” which is “the source of power that provides
moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act.”
In any insurgency, the source of strength
is the population. When the U.S. has Afghanistan’s citizens on its side, the
chance for peace will increase exponentially.
Success Relies on Winning over
Afghanistan’s Population
Both the Taliban and the Afghan government
are competing to mobilize Afghanistan’s population to unite with their
respective sides. Unfortunately, the Taliban has been more successful in
gaining the support of citizens.
In the past year, the Taliban has gained
more influence and control over the Afghan population. Much of the support has
come from rural areas, because the local population is disillusioned with the
current government.
The United States needs to understand that
the local population doesn’t adhere to the Taliban’s extreme Islamic ideology,
except in southern, eastern and western Afghanistan – including the provinces
of Wardak, Nuristan and Zabul. But with extensive corruption from the Afghani
government, it’s easy to inadvertently force the Afghani population into the
hands of insurgents like the Taliban.
U.S. Needs to Target the Sanctuary
Pakistan Offers to Insurgents
By its failure to deal with the sanctuary
that Pakistan offers to insurgent groups, these insurgent groups can
re-constitute themselves, build their organizations and formulate attacks
inside Afghanistan with impunity. Washington must find a way to disrupt safe
havens inside Pakistan.
The Pakistani government must also halt its
duplicitous actions. Pakistan states that it supports bringing stability to
Afghanistan, but it provides material support and logistics to the Taliban and
the Haqqani network through their intelligence agency, the Inter-Services
Intelligence Directorate (ISI).
Much of the leadership of the Taliban and
the Haqqani network, which the U.S. has been fighting in Afghanistan, resides
on the Pakistan side of the border. The leaders include:
The Taliban’s
Leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada
His deputies,
Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mohammad Yaqub
Senior leaders
like Abdul Qayyum Zakir, Ahmadullah Nanai, Abdul Latif Mansur and Noor Mohammad
Saqib
All of these leaders reside in Pakistan.
There are also a vast number of Taliban and Haqqani foot soldiers living in
Afghanistan, who fight a government they deem corrupt, incompetent and illegitimate.
The Trump administration needs to
reevaluate its strategy toward Pakistan, because the Taliban isn’t strong
enough to take Kabul or overthrow any other major Afghan city. In the same
vein, the Afghan government is too weak to defeat the Taliban on the
battlefield, so the U.S. is in the middle of a political stalemate.
What the US Could Do in Pakistan
In a report by Southeast Asian expert Seth
Jones, Jones suggests that the U.S. apply pressure to Pakistan. The U.S. could
warn the Pakistani government that if they continue to harbour the Taliban and
Haqqani leaders and fail to support the peace process, the United States will
initiate several escalatory steps by:
Providing more public transparency about
Pakistan activities. For example, the U.S. publicly disclose the names of
senior Taliban and Haqqani leaders residing in Pakistan. The U.S. could also
include declassified intelligence – including satellite imagery – of Taliban
locations in Pakistan.
Committing to aggressively pursue U.S.
enemies wherever it finds them. United States forces should be prepared to
target the Taliban, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other groups wherever they
are found — including Pakistan. The United States could directly target the
Taliban and Haqqani network in Pakistan or to surrogates that provide direct or
indirect support to these terror groups.
Continuing to
freeze or terminate most military aid to Pakistan.
Developing
additional alternative routes to bring material to U.S. forces in Afghanistan
through countries like Uzbekistan, which is situated along Afghanistan’s
northern distribution lines.
Suspending or
terminating Pakistan’s status as a non-NATO ally. Non-NATO ally status offers
military and financial advantages that generally are not available to non-NATO
countries.
Making it
more difficult for Islamabad to get access to multilateral financial lenders.
Placing
Pakistan on the U.S. Department of State’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.
U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies have already collected an abundance
of information about Pakistan’s ties to terrorist groups operating in
Afghanistan and India, from Lashkar-e-Taiba (or Jamaat-ud-Dawa) to the Afghan
Taliban and Haqqani network.
Both Pakistan and the United States have
long-term interests in a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. It’s time for the
U.S. to convince Islamabad that peace is in everyone’s interests. Failure will
ensure that the Afghan and Pakistani people will continue to suffer economic
and political hardships.

Title: Peace in Afghanistan: US Must Formulate A Strategy That Deals Directly With The Taliban And The Haqqani Network’s Sanctuary Inside Pakistan | John Ubaldi | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam


By John Ubaldi
September 19, 2018
The famous philosopher George Santayana
famously quoted, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.” This statement particularly applies to the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
The U.S. recently commemorated the 9/11
terror attacks that precipitated our involvement in Afghanistan. But since
2001, the United States has been unable to deal with the insurgent activity
inside Pakistan.
The Strength of an Insurgency
Whenever an insurgent group like the
Taliban enjoys a sanctuary inside a neighbouring country, they will either win
or drag out the conflict. If the United States is to be successful in bringing
stability to Afghanistan, it must place a significant amount of pressure on the
Taliban and Haqqani network inside Pakistan and stop Islamabad’s support for
these terrorist organizations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford recently traveled to
Pakistan. They sought to persuade Islamabad to stop supporting proxy forces
inside Afghanistan and start supporting the peace process.
Since the U.S. military intervention into
Afghanistan, Pakistan has become a safe haven for the Taliban and other Islamic
terror groups who operate with impunity, all under the watchful eye of
Islamabad. Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was even allowed to escape
across the border following the U.S. military incursion.
Trump: Time to Hold Pakistan Accountable
In the summer of 2017, President Trump
remarked that “Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and

The Taliban group is demanding the release of Anas Haqqani, the youngest son of the feared Haqqani terror network’s founder as part of an upcoming round of talks with the United States, it has been reported.
“This meeting with the U.S. authorities would either help pave the way for more meaningful talks or stop them forever,” a Taliban commander in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. “If they are sincere in talks in the future, they would accept our proposal for a prisoners’ exchange.”
According to NBC News, the four Taliban officials, speaking from Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, said that the next round of discussions will be held very soon and deal with a possible prisoner exchange.
In Washington, the State Department said no talks were scheduled and declined to comment on whether a potential prisoner swap was on the table. On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters, “We’re ready to work with the people of Afghanistan, the government of Afghanistan, and to talk to the Taliban all together to bring an end to the conflict.”
The Afghan government did not respond to requests for comment.
Anas Haqqani has been in Afghan custody since October 2014 when U.S. security forces nabbed him while en route to Qatar from Bahrain.
The network’s founder was reported to have died last week after a lengthy illness.

New Year’s Eve 2020 Celebrations Across the World
Rosemary DiCarlo said the situation has been complicated by the IEA’s new morality law
Published

The head of UN political affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, on Monday warned that the Doha process is at risk given the Islamic Emirate’s increasing restrictive policies.
Addressing a meeting on women’s rights in New York, ahead of the UN General Assembly, she said the Doha process “entails a step-for-step approach” with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), requiring them to, for example, make governance more inclusive, and to respect women’s and girl’s rights.
In exchange, the international community would then incrementally ease restrictions and provide development support.
DiCarlo said the situation has been complicated by the IEA’s new morality law.
“We had Member States willing to engage, willing to go forward with a step-for-step project. However, I think we risk right now of ending this process,” she warned.
“At this point, those who've been participating in our process want to continue, but they really expect the Taliban (IEA) to take part in good faith, and they've got to start abiding by their international obligations.”
She emphasized that “engagement is key”, stressing that “we cannot let Afghan women and men down.”
The general debate of the 79th session of the General Assembly opened Tuesday, 24 September, and will continue through Saturday, 28 September, and conclude on Monday, 30 September 2024.
The theme for the general debate of the 79th session of the General Assembly is "Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations".


The UN chief stressed that the oppression of women undermines Afghanistan’s development
Published

By
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Monday warned that Afghanistan’s new laws "strip Afghan women and girls of their rights and freedoms across the board," and are causing harm to the nation.
Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Guterres said there was "a deep crisis of gender-based discrimination and oppression" against women in Afghanistan.
"Afghan women and girls are largely confined to their homes, with no freedom of movement and almost no access to education or work," said the UN chief.
Stating that Afghan women also suffer high rates of violence, honor killings, and rising maternal mortality, he said many feel "unsafe, isolated and powerless."
The UN chief stressed that the oppression of women undermines Afghanistan's development and said: "Extreme gender-based discrimination is not only a systematic abuse of women and girls and a violation of human rights conventions and laws. It is self-harm on a national scale."
He called on Afghan authorities to remove all restrictions against women and girls, reopen schools, and allow women to fully participate in society.
"Without recognizing the rights of one-half of its population, Afghanistan will never take its rightful place on the global stage," Guterres said.
The ruling Islamic Emirate has however repeatedly said that women’s rights are ensured in Afghanistan in accordance with Sharia law.
Zia Ahmad Takal, Deputy Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the absence of an IEA representative at the summit was a violation of the rights of the people of Afghanistan.

Afghanistan’s foreign ministry has lashed out at the United Nations for not inviting an Islamic Emirate representative to attend the 79th UN General Assembly which gets underway in New York on Tuesday.
Zia Ahmad Takal, Deputy Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the absence of an IEA representative at the summit was a violation of the rights of the people of Afghanistan.
He said given the situation in the country, positive decisions should be made by the international community with regards to the country.
The Islamic Emirate appointed Suhail Shaheen as the permanent representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations, but the UN has not yet handed over the seat to the IEA.
The 79th UN General Assembly, deemed one of the largest global diplomatic events, will get underway on Tuesday in New York.
The General Assembly is held annually at UN headquarters in New York, bringing together the heads of state and government of member states. It is to take place from Sept. 24 to 30.
The 79th session will be opened by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and will be chaired by Cameroonian President Philemon Yong.
At least 133 heads of state and government, three vice presidents, 80 deputy prime ministers and 45 ministers are expected to attend.
UN leaders are meeting as numerous crises, conflicts and wars play out around the world.
Many of these, including Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and Haiti crises are expected to be on the agenda.
On Gaza, along with emphasizing a cease-fire, member states are expected to highlight Israel’s violations of international law and UN resolutions, as well as the difficulties in delivering humanitarian aid to the region, Anadolu reported.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak the morning of Sept. 26, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled for the afternoon.
This year, the main theme of the UN General Assembly discussions is "Leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations."
"Today's global order simply does not work for everyone. In fact, I would go further and say: it's not working for anyone," said Guterres.
Therefore, it is expected that leaders will address the reform of the Security Council and the international financial architecture.
