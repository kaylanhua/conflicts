{"year": 2018, "month": 10, "summary": "The ongoing violence in Afghanistan has been marked by a series of suicidal attacks and armed conflict primarily attributed to the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) and the Taliban. \n\n**Key Violent Incidents:**\n\n1. **Election Rally Attack (Nangarhar, October 2018)**  \n   - **Event:** A suicide bombing targeted an election rally for parliamentary candidates, leading to significant casualties.  \n   - **Casualties:** Reports vary, indicating between 14 dead and more than 30 injured.\n\n2. **Civilian Casualties Report (January - September 2018)**  \n   - **Analysis by:** United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  \n   - **Stats:** A total of 8,050 civilian casualties were documented, consisting of 2,798 deaths and 5,252 injuries.  \n   - **Causes:** Most casualties were caused by anti-government elements, primarily from ISKP (25%) and the Taliban (35%). IEDs and suicide attacks were responsible for almost half of these civilian casualties.\n\n3. **ISKP Activity in Nangarhar (Various Dates in 2018)**  \n   - **Context:** Nangarhar province is recognized as a stronghold for ISKP, where it has initiated multiple attacks against civilians and government targets.  \n   - **Impact:** In the first three quarters of 2018, Nangarhar recorded the highest number of civilian casualties, with reported fatalities significantly higher than Kabul during the same period.\n\n4. **US Drone Strikes on ISKP (Nangarhar, October 2018)**  \n   - **Event:** A US drone strike killed 21 ISIS fighters, targeting their hideouts.  \n   - **Context:** This was part of ongoing efforts against ISKP, but local sources claim that civilian casualties remain high due to air strikes.\n\n5. **Farah Province Offensive (May 2018)**  \n   - **Outcome:** Taliban forces reportedly attacked a coordinated gathering of Taliban and government forces, causing civilian and combatant casualties, with claims of civilian casualties rising amid military actions.\n\n6. **Clashes in Wazir Tangi (Nangarhar, October 2018)**  \n   - **Event:** The Taliban engaged in combat against ISKP in the mountainous region, leading to significant unrest and violence.  \n   - **Claims:** Taliban claimed territorial advances but local officials provided conflicting accounts about the degree of control retained by ISIS.\n\n**Overall Casualties and Trends:**\n- **Total Civilian Casualties (2018):** Approximately 1,700 civilian deaths attributed to the violence, with a significant portion (around 52%) linked to ISKP attacks.  \n- **Drone Strikes and Military Operations:** Operations by Afghan National Security Forces and US military have killed numerous insurgents, including a confirmed 57 killed in a recent operation across various provinces. \n\n**State of Insecurity:** \n- The enduring conflict demonstrates not only a continual struggle between these groups but also a prioritization on high-casualty attacks, with ISKP emerging as a particularly dangerous actor for civilian populations, targeting minorities and seen as regrouping despite ongoing military pressure. The Taliban also maintain a significant presence but have engaged in negotiations, leading to complexities in their operational strategies against ISKP."}
