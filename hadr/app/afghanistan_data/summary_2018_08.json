The assault resulted in an estimated **150 casualties**, with **150 killed** (including **20 civilians**) and **194 Taliban fighters** killed, alongside **147 injuries** among the militants.

Just a day prior, another base in **Faryab** saw the deaths of **17 troops** in a similar incident of Taliban overrunning a military installation.\n\n3. **Kabul Education Center Attack (August 15, 2018)**: A suicide bombing at Mawoud Academy in Kabul targeted mostly students, killing **34** and injuring **56** others. The attack was attributed to the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISKP), though they reportedly denied responsibility.\n\n4. **Ongoing Violence in Nangarhar (August 26, 2018)**: A suicide bombing outside an election commission office in **Nangarhar** killed two and wounded four, signifying a continuing pattern of attacks as the country approached parliamentary elections.\n\n5. **Border Airstrike in Takhar Province (August 27, 2018)**: An airstrike attributed to either Tajik or Russian forces reportedly targeted a Taliban position, resulting in the deaths of **eight militants** and injuries to six others.\n\nThese attacks reflect a broader trend of increasing hostilities by both the Taliban and the ISKP, raising alarms about the security situation in Afghanistan. The Afghan government grapples with sustaining authority amidst these crises, leading to a series of ministerial resignations and subsequent political instability as public confidence wanes. The Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, has sought to address escalating violence through offers of ceasefires, while the overall situation remains precariously volatile with significant threats to civil safety and governance."}
