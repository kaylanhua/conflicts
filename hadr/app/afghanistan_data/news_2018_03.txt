As the Trump administration continuesadvocating for a peace process in Afghanistan, U.S. officials are accusing the Russian government of hindering their efforts. Moscow has increased its support for the Taliban over the last year and a halfamid decaying U.S.-Russia relations, according to administration officials.
Russian support for the Taliban, which has been at war with U.S.-led coalition forces since 2001, includes the sharing of sensitive intelligence data.
"It's not an area of cooperation for them yet," explained a senior State Department official of Russia's failure to work with the U.S. in Afghanistan. The country is an area where Russia "can make points" about their displeasure with general state of bilateral relations.
As a result, the official indicated that Moscow is holding peace in Afghanistan hostage as their bilateral relations with the U.S. grow more toxic. Just last week,the U.S. slapped sanctions on Russian individuals and entitiesfor meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The U.S. also said that Russian operatives assaulted the U.S. electrical grid. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is still a target of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.
The U.S. hopes to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table in Afghanistan. When Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis traveled to Afghanistan last week, he indicated that "small groups" of the Taliban have shown a willingness to partake in talks with the Afghan government.
"You don't want to miss an opportunity, because you weren't alert to the opportunity. So you need to have that door open even if you increase the military pressure," said Mattis when asked if discussion of talks with the Taliban were premature. "We know there is interest on the Taliban side. We know that. So when you put all these together then that's why I think we are on the right track."
An invitation for peace negotiations, which the U.S. says must be Afghan-led, was issued by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in February. Ghani says that a peace process, with the involvement of the Taliban, would help "those who want to separate themselves from international terrorist organizations and terrorist activities."
The Taliban has not formally responded to the Afghan government's request for talks, and has instead asked the U.S. to negotiate with them directly. However, the U.S. is not willing to sit down with the Taliban without Afghan government leaders.
"It's now up to the Taliban leaders to respond to this serious offer. This is a peace offer that the United States supports and is prepared to facilitate, but we cannot substitute for the direct negotiations that are required between the Afghan government and the Taliban leadership," said State Department official Alice Wells earlier this month about Ghani's offer.
The U.S. currently has 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. Many of them are part of a counter-terrorism force supporting the Afghan government in its fight with ISIS, which hasseized small patches of territoryin the country in recent years.
Russia has criticized the Trump administration for sending more troops to Afghanistan and the Russian Foreign Ministry has admitted that Moscow shares intelligence with the Taliban. The U.S. sees the Taliban as a terrorist group, and thinks that Russia's relationship with them "effectively is legitimizing the Taliban as a military force," said a senior State Department official.
The State Department argues that Russia's support for the Taliban perpetuates instability across the region. Russia, meanwhile, insists that they are only trying to help destroy ISIS – a Taliban rival -- in the country, and that the U.S. is supporting ISIS. Russian support for the Taliban has led to public disagreements among American and Russian government officials and continues to enrage the U.S.
"We've lost more soldiers in Afghanistan fighting ISIS last year than fighting the Taliban and so to allege that somehow we're complicit or that we brought Daesh to Afghanistan is not only ludicrous, but it's insulting, infuriating," said a senior State Department official. Daesh is an Arabic name for ISIS.
The U.S. has also rejected Russian claims that there are many thousands of ISIS fighters in Afghanistan. "The numbers that are spread about the number of Daesh fighters by Russia is grossly exaggerated. It is around 1,500," said General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, earlier this year.
The Trump administration did not roll out its Afghanistan policy until August 2017. In the meantime, Russia continued to ramp up its Taliban support, unsure if the administration would completely pull out of the country and leave a vacuum in the process. Assurances from the Afghan government to the Russians, saying that peace would prevail, were not enough.
"It started with a lack of coherent U.S. policy towards Afghanistan," said an Afghan government official. "The Russians were worried about what happens to the region next. If the Taliban were to take over Afghanistan they wanted to be on their good side, at the very least, to stop extremism from spreading into Central Asia."
The Afghan official indicated that there is a developing relationship between U.S., Afghanistan and Russia to share intelligence on ISIS. This effort gives the Russians better assurance on ISIS activity in Afghanistan, with the hope that they will stop backing the Taliban. U.S. officials would not confirm any intelligence sharing with the Russians, instead discussing ongoing American efforts against ISIS in Afghanistan.
"In 2017, we actually tripled the number of strikes against ISIS. We had about 1,400 ground tactical strikes. We took out 1,600 ISIS fighters. We killed three of their leaders. We shrunk their presence in Nangarhar from nine districts to between three and five districts," said a senior State Department official. "And you're going to see those efforts intensify because for us, you know, ISIS has to be defeated."
Despite the challenge presented by Russia, U.S. officials say they will continue their efforts to eliminate ISIS and bring the Taliban into peace negotiations. They also hope to assist the Afghan government in making it harder for the Taliban, which currently controls roughly 40 percent of the country, to conduct operations.

Title: Nicholson: US Planning Religious, Diplomatic, Military and Social Pressure on Taliban
Print
The top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan said a combination of religious, social, diplomatic and military pressure will be applied to the Taliban this year to force them to start negotiating for peace in the war-torn country.
General John Nicholson, who is leading U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, told a group of journalists Monday in Kabul the multi-pronged approach would be different from past years.
"There will be religious pressure applied to the Taliban with the ulemas hosted in Indonesia and elsewhere to strip away the religious legitimacy for jihad in Afghanistan," Nicholson said, referring to Muslim scholars with expertise in Islamic law.
In January, Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority country, proposed setting up a committee of ulemas from Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan to help resolve the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.
Explaining the other parts of the strategy, Nicholson said the Taliban would feel the social pressure when Afghans elect their own leaders later this year in parliamentary elections, whereas the U.S. South Asia policy is applying diplomatic pressure on neighboring Pakistan to use its influence on the Taliban to facilitate reconciliation inside Afghanistan. Nicholson pointed to the increased number of U.S. troops and airpower in the country, as well as the strengthening of Afghan special forces and air force, which he said would add to military pressure on the Taliban.
​Political solution
"At the same time, there will be a strong effort in the area of advancing the reconciliation process," he said.
President Ashraf Ghani last month offered the Taliban the opportunity to come to the table and renounce violence in return for political recognition, the opening of an office in Kabul, jobs, and other perks. He said there were no preconditions for peace talks.
The Taliban have not responded to the offer, leading to speculation they might be considering it.
According to the office of Afghan CEO Abdullah Abdullah, Pakistan's National Security Adviser Nasir Janjua told him in a meeting that after Ghani's offer, the Taliban no longer had any excuse to continue fighting.
Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, also indicated his country would like to see the Taliban rehabilitated.
A senior Pakistani military official, who spoke to a group of reporters on condition of anonymity, maintained that his country was pushing the Taliban to be a part of the talks. "We are sincerely trying to persuade them" and their allied Haqqani group to join the Afghan reconciliation process, he said.
The Taliban, meanwhile, have written an open letter to the American people calling for direct dialogue with the U.S. government. The United States has said any talks would have to be Afghan-led.
Muslim committee
Separately, a spokesman for the High Peace Council, a group heading efforts to end the conflict in Afghanistan, said no date was confirmed for the Indonesian initiative. In a briefing with journalists after a council meeting, Akram Khpalwak urged the Pakistani clerics to participate, but indicated their doing so was not confirmed.
Khpalwak said if the Taliban responded negatively to Ghani's offer, their current offices in Doha, Qatar, could be closed down.
Violence in Afghanistan has not subsided. Recently, a NATO convoy near Kandahar and a foreign security firm in Kabul were targeted, leading to casualties, and in another incident, the Taliban captured a district office in Farah province before Afghan forces pushed them back.
Several high-profile attacks on Kabul this year have also exposed security vulnerabilities of Afghan and foreign forces. One such attack in January killed close to 100 people. Days before, an attack on one of Kabul's luxury hotels left more than 20 people dead, including many foreigners.
The pressure on Pakistan apparently has not yielded the desired results.
"While there have been actions to date, these actions have not reduced violence; these actions have not produced an end to sanctuaries and support inside Pakistan," Nicholson said.

Title: Taliban Skeptical of Afghan Government's Peace Offer 
Print
The Afghan Taliban say they are deeply skeptical that a proposed three-nation conference in Indonesia will be a step toward peace.Jakarta is preparing to host a trilateral conference where religious scholars from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Indonesia would seek ways to bring peace to war-torn Afghanistan.But the Afghan Taliban urged scholars, to boycott the conference.In a note to journalists, the Afghan Taliban said the conference was purely intended to "legitimize the illegitimate government of Afghanistan and the presence of infidel invaders in the country".The Afghan religious council, a body leading the Afghan side in the conference, denies the claim and says the conference will feature discussions among religious scholars, searching for a path to peace and security, and the end of terrorism.The head of media and strategic relations of the High Peace Council said: "We will facilitate their presence should the Afghan Taliban intend to participate in the conference." Sayed Ehsanullah Tahiri also told VOA his group would ask Indonesian officials to invite the Taliban to the conference.Indonesia's religious council said the Taliban's doubts about the conference will not derail the effort."Maybe the Taliban is not well-informed and received the wrong information about the conference," Muhyiddin Junaidi of Indonesia's religious council told Arab News."We just want to listen to them and share our experience in resolving conflicts. We also want to synchronize our procedures on issuing a fatwa [to bring peace in Afghanistan]," Junaidi added.Pakistani religious scholars' council sees the Indonesian trilateral conference as an opportunity for peace.Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi, chairman Pakistan Religious Council told VOA Urdu: "This is the first time we have heard that Indonesia is hosting such a conference. We think only dialogue can bring peace to the Afghan conflict."No date is set for the conference yet. Afghan and Indonesian officials say, however, it will be held later this month in Jakarta.Peace OfferAfghan President Ashraf Ghani offered unconditional talks to the Taliban and said to recognize the group as a political party. The president also offered to provide passports to Taliban members and their families, along with an office in Kabul.The Afghan government insists the Taliban will never achieve victory on the battlefield. That is why the commander of US-led NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, says insurgent group would be wise to accept the peace offer."So this really is probably their best time to attempt a negotiation, because it's only going to get worse for them," he added.While the Taliban might still mull whether to accept or reject the offer, a former member of the insurgent group claims the Taliban does not trust the peace negotiation offered by the Afghan president."The doors of negotiations were closed when Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour [Taliban leader] got killed. Now the Taliban will not negotiate because it would cement the narrative of being forced to negotiate and they do not want to display weakness," Waheed Muzhda, a former Taliban member told VOA."Taliban have said that the negotiation is a conspiracy to weaken and divide us," he added.The insurgent group previously offered to hold talks on a possible peace agreement, not with Afghanistan government, but directly with the United States.The offer was declined earlier by U.S. officials, and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis: "We want the Afghans to lead and provide the substance to the reconciliation effort," Mattis told reporters.International ReactionWhile the Afghan Taliban has not accepted the peace process, leaders of the international community joined the Afghan government urging the Taliban to take advantage of the offer.Last Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reaffirmed NATO's support of an Afghan-led peace deal."I commend President Ghani for his courageous leadership. His offer to the Taliban is the clearest invitation to peace yet. So I call on the Taliban to come to the negotiating table. There is an opportunity now to end the conflict", he added.Members of the UN Security Council also welcomed the Afghan government's offer, commending theiecommitment to developing a practical plan for reconciliation.Last Thursday, the UN Security Council urged the insurgent group to "accept this offer without any preconditions and without the threat of violence, with the aim of an ultimate political settlement that leads to sustainable peace for the people of Afghanistan."Similarly, China and the European Union believe the Taliban should seize the opportunity and accept the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's offer to recognize the movement as a legitimate political group."China and the EU believe that this is an offer that is meaningful. It is an offer that presents an opportunity and a window that should be seized by all parties across the conflict lines," Ambassador Roland Kobia, EU's special envoy to Afghanistan said last Wednesday in Beijing, according to Reuters.While the peace offer is still on the table, the Afghan government and its international allies continue to target the Taliban as the insurgents carry out attacks all over the country.

Title: US accuses Russia of supplying arms to the Taliban - World - DAWN.COM
Russia is supporting and supplying arms to the Taliban, Gen John Nicholson, the head of US forces in Afghanistan, told theBBCin an interview.
Nicholson, during the interview published on Friday, said he had seen "destabilising activity by the Russians", alleging that Russian weapons were smuggled across the Tajik border to the Taliban. He, however, did not say in what quantity.
"We see a narrative that's being used that grossly exaggerates the number of Isis [Islamic State group] fighters here," Gen Nicholson was quoted as saying by theBBC. "This narrative then is used as a justification for the Russians to legitimise the actions of Taliban and provide some degree of support to the Taliban."
"We've had stories written by the Taliban that have appeared in the media about financial support provided by the enemy," he added. "We've had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders who said, 'This was given by the Russians to the Taliban' — we know that the Russians are involved."
Russian officials havepreviously denied providing aid to the militants, saying that their limited contacts were aimed at bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table.
Last year in March, theUS media had reportedthat Russia was providing political legitimacy and military supplies to the Taliban in Afghanistan.
“American military officers see a growing Russian effort to bolster the Taliban’s legitimacy and undercut (the US and) Nato’s military effort there,”CNNhad reported.
A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry had rejected the claims as “absolutely false”, alleging that such announcements were “designed to justify the failure of the American political and military campaigns” in Afghanistan.

Title: Taliban and ISKP Attacks Foreshadows Violent Year in Afghanistan
By Sudha Ramachandran
March 13, 2018, the CACI Analyst
Afghanistan has seen a bloody start of the New Year. In January, the Taliban and the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) – Khorasan is the old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas – carried out four major attacks on high-profile targets in Kabul. With competition between the two intensifying and each trying to outdo the other in the magnitude of the terror they unleash, violent attacks in the Afghan capital can be expected to increase this year. Public confidence in the Afghan government has hit rock bottom.




BACKGROUND:Duringa week in January, the Taliban and ISKP carried out at least four large-scale attacks – three in Kabul and one in Jalalabad – that claimed the lives of 140 people. On January 20, Taliban fighters in army uniforms laid siege to Kabul’s Intercontinental Hotel. Twenty people, including 14 foreigners were killed in the 13-hour gun-battle. Five days later, ISKP suicide bombers attacked the Jalalabad office of the international NGO Save the Children Fund, and killed at least 6 people, including four staff. The Taliban struck again on January 27; a militant drove an explosives-filled ambulance into the heart of Kabul and detonated the explosives on a busy street to kill at least 103 people and injure as many as 235. A day later, eleven soldiers were killed when ISKP militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles attacked an army unit guarding a military academy in Kabul.
The January attacks underscore yet again the capacity of the Taliban and the ISKP to attack even tightly guarded facilities in the capital. Security arrangements in Kabul were strengthened in the wake of the suicide bombing just outside Kabul’s diplomatic district on May 31 last year, which left 150 people dead and 400 others injured. The heightened security notwithstanding, a Taliban suicide bomber struck just outside the Kabul military academy five months later. Security at the military facility was tightened further; however, this did not deter either the Taliban or the ISKP.
Over the past year, Taliban and ISKP hideouts have been subjected to relentless aerial bombing by the U.S. Between January 1 and October 31 last year, the U.S. Air Force dropped 3,554 bombs on Taliban hideouts – three times the number dropped in 2016 and four times that in 2015. In April, it used the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), the largest non-nuclear bomb in its arsenal, to pulverize ISKP tunnel complexes in Nangarhar. The January attacks indicate that the U.S. aerial bombing of Taliban and ISKP hideouts did not dent their capacities or confidence.
IMPLICATIONS:The attacks came just weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the decision to cut off almost US$ 2 billion in aid to Pakistan for its continued support to the Taliban and its affiliate, the Haqqani Network, prompting speculation in Kabul about whether the recent upsurge in violence was a fallout of the U.S. decision. An unnamed Afghan official attributed the wave of attacks to “Pakistan pushing back against the new U.S. strategy” and described it as “a small taste of what it’s capable of.” An angry Afghan government swung into action. On January 30, it dispatched a high-power delegation led by Afghan Interior Minister Wais Barmak to Islamabad, where “undeniable evidence that the attacks were planned there [in Pakistan]” was shared with Pakistani officials, Afghan intelligence Chief Masoom Stanekzai said. This included a list of names of people involved in the attacks and of Pakistani madrasas where the attacks were planned.
In previous years, the Taliban would wait for the snow to melt and mountain passes to open before intensifying attacks as part of its annual “spring offensive.” This year it did not wait for spring to escalate violence. Trump’s tweet on January 1, announcing the aid cut-off to Pakistan could have resulted in the Taliban striking early.
The January attacks in Kabul confirm that competition between the Taliban and the ISKP is heating up. Since early 2015 when the ISKP announced its entry into Afghanistan, the two have clashed violently on several occasions. While the ISKP was successful in drawing some disgruntled Taliban commanders it has not been able to extend its influence beyond Nangarhar province. Since July last year, it has signaled an interest in targeting Kabul. Attacks with a large number of casualties in Kabul are rewarding for those seeking to terrorize the population, drawing substantial attention in the media and thus serving to attract recruits keen to join the group perceived as most potent of the two. Importantly, attacks in Kabul are likely to impress foreign governments and others funding their violent operations. With the recent attacks, Kabul has emerged the main battleground in the Taliban-ISKP rivalry.
Violent attacks in Kabul are also useful to deepen the wedge between the capital’s residents and the Ashraf Ghani government. A growing number of civilians in the capital are questioning Ghani’s capacity to provide them with basic security. They are wondering what use is a government that cannot defend the capital from repeated terror attacks. The prestige of the state in the eyes of Kabul’s residents has been undermined by the recent attacks and public confidence in the Ghani government is at an all-time low. This is not a new development but an alarming one in a country that is struggling to build democratic state institutions.
The Taliban and the ISKP are likely to escalate attacks in Kabul in the coming months especially as spring approaches, when the movement of fighters from Pakistan to Afghanistan will become easier. The Ghani government, whose credibility has plunged seriously, could use terror attacks in Kabul to justify postponing upcoming elections to parliament and district councils. Postponement of elections will weaken Afghanistan’s already fragile democracy.
The impact of the Kabul attacks on Trump’s Afghan strategy will be keenly observed in Afghanistan and abroad, especially the neighborhood. On August 21, Trump announced his “new” strategy to boost the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. The scaling up of military operations against the Taliban and ISKP were widely viewed as an attempt to convince them that they cannot win on the battlefield. With their attacks in Kabul in January, the Taliban and ISKP sent a corresponding signal to the U.S.. However, the recent attacks are unlikely to convince Trump to change tracks. Consequently, a serious escalation of the conflict is to be expected this year.
CONCLUSIONS:The recent attacks in Kabul and Jalalabad underscore the fact that the Taliban cannot be defeated on the battlefield. In the circumstances, the surge in troops proposed by the Trump administration could end up being another exercise in futility. The attacks confirm that contrary to U.S. claims, the capacities of the Taliban and the ISKP are growing. The outlook for Afghanistan has never been bleaker. The U.S.-led military operations against the Taliban in the 2000s could not defeat the Taliban. Neither the surge in American troops in 2010 nor the draw-down in 2014 ended the fighting. The U.S.’s acceleration of aerial bombing has not worked to deter the Taliban or the ISKP from carrying out high-profile attacks. Thus, the military option to end the insurgency has clearly not worked. A negotiation process that includes the Taliban seems the only way out. Space may have opened up for the Chinese, who are mediating a peace process that includes the Afghan and Pakistani governments and the Taliban. The question is whether the Taliban are interested.

Title:  Kuwait underlines importance of diplomatic negotiations to reach peace in Afghanistan

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) NEW YORK, March 9 (KUNA) -- Kuwait underlined the importance of achieving an ever-lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan throughdiplomaticnegotiations to reach a settlement; and not through military might.Kuwait Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Mansour Al-Otaibi made the remarks Thursday night in a Security Council session, which tackled the latest developments in Afghanistan.Al-Otaibi also welcomed the extension of UNAMA's mandate, noting that for more than four decades, Afghanistan had suffered fromPoliticalinstability.Such conditions, noted, required all concerned political leaders to prioritize national interests over partisan ones.The Council must continue to support the political process and encourage the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections on time, affirmed Al-Otaibi.He also welcomed progress made by the Independent Election Committee towards holding elections next July, despite recent unrest.The Ambassador voiced support for the Secretary General's appeal to lower threats in Afghanistan and Central Asia.Meanwhile, last night the Security Council renewed the mandate of the United Nations political mission in Afghanistan for another year to continue assisting the government and the people of the conflict-plagued country."We have important tasks ahead of us this year," Tadamichi Yamamoto, the Secretary General's Special Representative and head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), told the 15-member Council, which voted unanimously to extend the operation's mandate until March 17, 2019.Looking ahead, he noted that the Mission also focuses on peace efforts, the upcoming elections and the Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan, which the UN would host with the Afghan Government in Geneva on November 28. He also noted that the Mission's critical work covers human rights and reforms, including anti-corruption.On the political front, Yamamoto said that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered peace to the Taliban without preconditions, and laid out a path for negotiations with a series of concrete proposals to create space for the opening of talks."The offer of negotiation is on the table. It is now incumbent upon the Taliban to come forward with an offer of their own, and start direct talks with the Government to put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people," he said.Expressing concern about some actions that could deepen divisions in society, Yamamoto stressed that political leaders need to put the national interest above partisan agenda.As for security, Yamamoto expressed concern over the increase in civilian casualties caused by the so-called Islamic State in the Khorasan Province, or ISKP.The ISKP has been expanding its geographical spread beyond its stronghold of eastern Afghanistan into the country's north.On the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2018 and presidential elections for 2019, he cited accelerated progress on voter registration preparations, but said timelines remain tight.

It is now incumbent upon the Taliban to come forward with an offer of their own, and start direct talks with the Government to put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people," he said.Expressing concern about some actions that could deepen divisions in society, Yamamoto stressed that political leaders need to put the national interest above partisan agenda.As for security, Yamamoto expressed concern over the increase in civilian casualties caused by the so-called Islamic State in the Khorasan Province, or ISKP.The ISKP has been expanding its geographical spread beyond its stronghold of eastern Afghanistan into the country's north.On the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2018 and presidential elections for 2019, he cited accelerated progress on voter registration preparations, but said timelines remain tight.

Title: Security Council renews UN mission in Afghanistan; debate highlights womenâ€™s power | Indiablooms - First Portal on Digital News Management
New York, Mar 9 (JEN): The Security Council on Thursday renewed the mandate of the United Nations political mission in Afghanistan for another year to continue providing assistance to the Government and the people of the conflict-plagued country.
“We have important tasks ahead of us this year,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative and head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), told the 15-member Council, which voted unanimously to extend the operation’s mandate until 17 March 2019.
Looking ahead, he noted that the Mission also focus on peace efforts, the upcoming elections and the Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan which the UN would host with the Afghan Government in Geneva on 28 November. He also noted that the Mission’s critical work covers human rights and reforms, including anti-corruption.
On the political front, Yamamoto said that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered peace to the Taliban without preconditions, and laid out a path for negotiations with a series of concrete proposals to create space for the opening of talks.
“The offer of negotiation is on the table. It is now incumbent upon the Taliban to come forward with an offer of their own, and start direct talks with the Government to put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people,” he said.
Expressing concern about some actions which could deepen divisions in society, Yamamoto stressed that political leaders need to put the national interest above partisan agenda.
As for security, Yamamoto expressed a concern over the increase in civilian casualties caused by the Islamic State in the Khorasan Province, or ISKP. The ISKP has been expanding its geographical spread beyond its stronghold of eastern Afghanistan into the country’s north.On the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2018 and presidential elections for 2019, he cited accelerated progress on voter registration preparations, but said timelines remain tight.
He also said that in 2016 and 2017, 1.5 million refugees returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Iran. But such large numbers stress the Government’s ability to provide services. “This gap must be addressed before encouraging more people to move back to their homeland voluntarily,” he said.
Afghan women’s strength holds fabric of society together
Yamamoto’s remarks also highlighted the power of Afghan women as today’s meeting organized by the Netherlands, the Council president this month, was held on International Women’s Day.
He said the UN is working with Afghanistan’s electoral commission to ensure women’s participation in all stages of the elections as candidates, campaigners and voters.
He also reported that the Afghan Cabinet has adopted the necessary amendment to the Penal Code to ensure that all provisions of the Elimination of Violence Against Women law continue to apply, giving Afghan women continuing legal protection from violence.
The meeting was chaired by the Netherlands’s Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation, Sigrid Kaag, who led an all-women delegation.“Women are also disproportionately affected by the conflict,” he said, noting that last year, more than 1,200 women were killed or injured, mostly from ground fighting and suicide attacks.
Also addressing the meeting were Mariam Safi, Founding Director of the Organization for Policy Research and Development Studies (DROPS), and Habibi Sarabi, Deputy Chairperson of the High Peace Council – whom Mr. Yamamoto introduced as “two women with distinguished careers in working for the advancement of peace in Afghanistan.”

Title: Five Questions to Make Sense of the New Peak in Urban Attacks and a Violent Week in Kabul - Afghanistan | ReliefWeb
Afghanistan
Between 20 and 29 January 2018, there were five high profile attacks in major cities and districts in Afghanistan. The three by far largest ones happened in the capital Kabul. This feeds into a month-long period of such attacks that began in late December 2017. Altogether, almost 250 people, most of them civilians, were killed in these attacks. Three of them (and half of the attacks countrywide) have been claimed by the Islamic State and two by the Taleban, but with the changing dynamics of the Afghan conflict is it becoming increasingly difficult to trust the claims of responsibility or to attribute responsibility. AAN’s Thomas Ruttig – with input from the AAN team – tries to make sense of the attacks and what they mean for the continued conflict and politics in Afghanistan.
1. What happened and who claimed responsibility?
The current wave of attacks represents a new peak of the urban terrorist campaign carried out by the Taleban and by local IS-affiliated groups. Since 28 December 2017, there have been eight attacks in three major cities, Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar.
The list of the attacks in major urban areas:
High-profile attacks in urban areas tend to overshadow ongoing fighting in provinces. However, there has also been simultaneous fighting in a number of provinces outside Kabul over this period. On the days of the biggest attacks alone, 20 and 27 January, media and other reports registered fighting and other security incidents in seven other provinces.
ISKP claimed four attacks, the Taleban claimed and denied their involvement in one. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess the claims and to attribute responsibility. There are indications that the diverse pro-IS groups are claiming attacks that have not been carried out by them. There are also indications that the Taleban are denying their involvement in attacks when there are particularly high numbers of civilian casualties. (The Taleban’s notion of civilians is discussed below). For example, the Taleban denied their involvement in the 31 December attack in Jalalabad that killed 18 people. According to Al-Jazeera ISKP claimed responsibility for it.
For the Taleban, or the semi-autonomous Haqqani network, it might be convenient that the IS claims attacks that have resulted in considerable loss of civilian lives.
In Kabul, there also might be an infrastructure, logistics and possible personnel (‘terrorists to hire’) that can be utilised by the Haqqani network or other Taleban groups, splinter groups now sailing under an IS banner, and violent Pakistani sectarian (anti-Shia) groups.
2. What accounts for this peak in attacks? What are possible motives?
This is not the first peak of attacks over recent years. There have been an earlier series of and extremely fatal single attacks, such as the April 2016 truck bomb claimed by the Taleban (AAN report here) and the one on 31 May 2017 near the German embassy when some 150 people were killed. This latter attack was not claimed by any group, and the Taleban denied their involvement. On 7 August 2015, three attacks happened on one day in Kabul, including another truck bomb – again denied by the Taleban and not claimed by any group – which killed some 50 people killed and wounded several hundred (media report here). The period between 16 and 21 October 2017 saw a series of countrywide, mainly Taleban, attacks on districts centres and government forces installations, with one IS-claimed suicide attack against a Shia mosque in Kabul.
The July 2016 suicide bomb attack against a peaceful demonstration of mainly Hazaras (media report here) and the September 2016 attack on the American University in Kabul – again not claimed by any group – indicated that ‘soft targets’ were being attacked more frequently.
At least five factors have contributed to the current peak:
3. What are the targets and who the victims of the attacks?
An estimated 232 people have been killed in the eight attacks since 28 December 2017. Although members of the security forces and private security guards (in the Kabul hotel attack) were among the victims in all attacks, most of them were civilians, according to preliminary media information. This was the case in the Kabul education centre bombing, the Jalalabad funeral bombing (even if police were also there), the Kabul hotel attack (see above) and the ‘ambulance’ bomb in Kabul, as well as the attack on Save The Children (four of the organisation’s staff and one policeman dead). Also see this video of the 27 January explosion’s impact inside Jumhuriat Hospital as shared on social media.
The Taleban have denied official figures and insist that, for example, most of the ‘ambulance bomb’ victims were police. This followed repeated declarations that they do not target ‘civilians’. In their 28 January 2018 statement (here, in Dari here) they claim most casualties were “officers and workers (mansubin wa karkonan) … inside the old Ministry of Interior building.” Kabul daily Etilaat Roz also quoted eyewitnesses that three cobblers and two street children were amongst those killed.
The reason for this discrepancy is that the Taleban definition of civilian does not correspond with that of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Taleban allow, for example, attacks, not only on military targets, but also on civilian government installations and those of what they call “invaders.” It is also clear that the use of an emergency van rigged with explosives as a car bomb, as on 27 January in Kabul, contradicts the international humanitarian law. In their already quoted statement, the Taleban justified their recent attacks as a reply to the US strategy:
If you want to play power politics and talk through the barrel of the gun, then do not expect roses from the Afghans either and await such replies.
UNAMA’s most recent reports show that the number of Afghan civilian casualties has also risen again as a result of US and Afghan airstrikes. Even excluding those that are awaiting investigation results, these attacks could amount to war crimes, and there is no justification for any party to commit such acts.
The IS acts more indiscriminately. It also attacks government and allied installations, particularly the Shia community, arguing that members of that community are involved in fighting the IS in the Middle East. After the 28 December Kabul attack, it issued a statement that the attacked facility was a “recruitment centre” for the Afghan (mainly Hazara) Fatemiyun militias fighting in Syria for the Assad regime, posted by Afghan IS watcher Mussa Imran (here; see also AAN analysis here); for the Fatemiyun, see AAN reporting here and here). In areas under ISKP control, it suppresses everyone who is in disagreement with it. There have been numerous executions of tribal elders, videos of which have been repeatedly posted online.
4. What does the past month’s violence say about the security situation in Kabul and the conflict in Afghanistan?
As noted above, this peak of attacks does not – yet – constitute a major shift in the conflict or the modus operandi of the Taleban. However, every new attack adds new victims to the war and every new battle, especially in the provinces, causes more people to flee their homes. This contributes to the feeling of a worsening security situation and the feeling that the government and its security organs are incapable of stopping terror attacks. UNAMA has shown in its most recent civilian casualty reports that in 2016 and 2017 Kabul has experienced a rising number of attacks and casualties resulting from them. Also the UN’s downgrading of Afghanistan in its mission review from post- to in-conflict country reflects the general deterioration of security in the entire country.
Parts of the political opposition are trying to capitalise on the growing fear and rage over the carnage. They criticise the government for its alleged failure to protect the population from the attacks, with some groups demanding its resignation. This is similar to the events during the June 2017 protests that had also been partly caused by an IS-claimed bombing (see AAN analysis here). Protests demonstrations have been announced again. In fact, key government critics have been in governmental positions themselves, some until recently, when similar attacks (see above) happened. Experience shows that governments, even in much more stable countries, from Indonesia to France, have not proven themselves able to prevent terrorist attacks.
5. What does this mean for the prospects of peace (talks)?
The Taleban’s recent wave of highly fatal attacks, causing many civilian casualties, has not made the idea of a negotiated end to the war through talks with them more popular. The US president now has also ruled that out in a reaction to the attacks. The IS seems to be out of bounds for any negotiations anyway.
So, the dilemma remains: Can there be a military solution to Afghanistan’s many problems? Many observers agree there cannot, looking at the failed attempt during the 2009-12 US troop surge that both failed to defeat or force the Taleban to the negotiating table, with up to 140,000 foreign and some 300,000 government troops and police. However, many in the Afghan political class and the wider population seem to entertain the hope that a military solution could be achieved. This is shown by a number of reactions on social media, including from well-known Afghan politicians, to president Trump’s hardened stance toward Pakistan and his latest rejection of talks with the Taleban show. A local shura in Logar province reportedly awarded a bravery medal to him for his stance on Pakistan.
Given the current, much lower, number of foreign troops – around 15,000 now – with only elite parts of the Afghan forces with improved fighting skills, this remains doubtful. The entire Afghan force will still take years to be able to take over full security responsibility in practice. Also, the current US strategy has been presented so far as an attempt to prevent a Taleban take-over (AAN analysis here), which would require subsequent talks. The American ambiguity stands in the way of developing a clear-cut strategy to end the conflict.
As we have written recently, 2017 was a lost year for peace talks and the outlook for 2018 remains bleak on this, as the Afghan parties, and now the US, build new hurdles for a political resolution, being determined to escalate the war at the same time. Under these circumstances, the choice for Afghans – civilians, government and insurgents – is between talks with an opposite party they despise, or years of continued bloodshed.

Title: Afghan Civilian Casualties, the Elephant in the Room – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
Civilian deaths in Afghanistan shouldn’t be treated as simple statistics that no one wants to talk about.
Afghan civilians are becoming casualties of war in alarming numbers. More than 28,000 civilians have been killed and more than 50,000 injured since 2009,accordingto the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). This number does not include thousands of others who died between 2001 and 2008.
2017 saw3,438 dead and 7,015 injured — 65 percent of the casualties were attributed to the anti-government elements, namely the Taliban and Islamic State. Twenty-five percent of these casualties have been attributed to the pro-government elements (including 16 percent attributed to the Afghan National Security Forces, or ANSF, and 2 percent to international military forces). Eleven percent of these casualties were attributed to crossfire, and 1 percent to border shelling from Pakistan, while the rest cannot be attributed to any warring parties.
In January 2018, a car bomb attack by the Taliban using an ambulance killed over103and injured over 200 people, atextbook exampleof a war crime. Incidents like these happen in highly populated areas where civilians go about their daily lives. In this particular case, the attack took place near the Ministry of Interior and a hospital where men, women, and children gathered to receive public services.
Problem
The main problem is the multiplicity of warfronts in Afghanistan. The Afghan government is currently fightingover 20 differentterrorist groups, as well as drug lords, while also attempting to rebuild its weak institutions and garner legitimacy. Another problem is the lack of attention and prioritization of the matter of civilian lives by both national and international actors.
Incident after incident, the Afghan government promises to avenge or launch investigations, which never end. Afghan officials send their thoughts and prayers with no real impact on prevention of further deaths. A recentdeclaration bythe AfghanUlema(religious scholars) barely mentioned the issue of civilian protection.
Consultationsabout a possible peace process overlook the issue of the protection of civilian lives. Emphasis on the prevention of civilian casualties has rarely surfaced in fora such as theQuadrilateral Coordination Group,a forum discussing a possible framework for peace between Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, and the United States.
Solution
The ANSF must ensure that their rules of engagement and operations include measures that ensure the safety of noncombatants. Protection of civilians must be institutionalized. Stricter control of Afghanistan borders, hunting down precursors to explosives, and raising the issue at the UN and other international arenas are some of the other ways to address the problem.
Among international forces, the U.S. military,which carries out mostof the airstrikes in Afghanistan,has not only moral and legal obligations to protect civilians, but also for practical reasons it has to take the matter seriously. U.S. military veterans such as General David Petraeus and ChrisKolendahave acknowledged that civilian casualties by international forces sustained the war and concludedthat protection of civilians is essential to the success of U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
The rest of the international community and humanitarian organizations bear the responsibility to give voice to the voiceless. Recording civilian casualties is a great service to the families of the victims, who would hopefully one day be able to seek justice, but recording alone is not enough. The focus should be on prevention. How can further deaths of innocents be prevented? The international community such as the UN, European Union, Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and others can help in building the capacity of the ANSF. They can also raise concerns about the matter with respective actors and emphasize on protection of civilian.
For the Taliban, if it is serious about taking part in a peace process, it must cease attacking civilian targets. No one is winning this war. The Afghan government has made a generous offer by signalling it is willing to enter into negotiations without conditions. The Taliban should seize the moment and enter into negotiations with the Afghan government. The sides should agree to a ceasefire which can help drastically reduce the suffering of civilians.
For too long Afghan civilians have suffered from this chronic conflict. They deserve to be included in national and international debates about war and peace. Civilian deaths shouldn’t be treated merely as statistics and or an elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about.

Title: The US and Afghan crisis - Perspective - Herald

On February 13, 2018, Daniel Coats, Director National Intelligence, presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee an unclassified testimony, representing the views of 17 intelligence agencies that are part of the US intelligence community. The assessment of the current situation in Afghanistan, and what the immediate future would look like, was presented as follows:
“The overall situation in Afghanistan probably will deteriorate modestly this year in the face of persistent political instability, sustained attacks by the Taliban-led insurgency, unsteady Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) performance, and chronic financial shortfalls. The National Unity Government (NUG) probably will struggle to hold long-delayed parliamentary elections, currently scheduled for July 2018, and to prepare for a presidential election in 2019. The ANSF probably will maintain control of most major population centres with coalition force support, but the intensity and geographic scope of Taliban activities will put those centres under continued strain. Afghanistan’s economic growth will stagnate at around 2.5 per cent per year and Kabul will 
remain reliant on international donors for the great majority of its funding well beyond 2018.”
This succinct and grim summary presented in the morning session was followed by a classified briefing later that day which is obviously not available to the general public. However, as a close follower of events in Afghanistan I will try in the next few paragraphs to indicate what in my view were the points that would have been made in the classified section of the briefing before giving my own conclusions.
The following is what I think must have been the gist of the exchanges during the classified part of the intelligence briefing:
“[At the time of the briefing] there have been no suicide or IED attacks in Kabul or other urban centres in Afghanistan comparable to those  that occurred in January and early February.* This does not mean, however, that the situation in Afghanistan – political and economic – has stabilised. It remains fraught. No Afghan politician or analyst believes that the district and parliamentary elections will be held as scheduled in July this year. The National Unity Government has not resolved the problem of provincial governors such as Atta Mohammad Noor or General Razik’s defiance of its orders. Opposition continues to grow with support for the NUG dwindling and President Ashraf Ghani being forced to refute charges of ethnonationalism (putting only Pakhtuns in positions of power).
“There has been some progress in economic reform but apart from the budget of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which is met almost entirely by foreign funding, even the normal budget continues to be dependent (55 to 63 per cent) on foreign assistance. Barring some progress on reconciliation, there is little prospect of Afghanistan’s economic situation improving in the near future. Afghanistan’s production of 9,000 tons of opium is a major contributor to the generation of employment and income for the economy of virtually every province in Afghanistan. The role it plays in generating income not only for the Taliban but for corrupt Afghan officials and local warlords also fosters spoilers who want instability to continue in Afghanistan.
“An impressive list of operations by the untethered American forces (1,644 ground operations and 181 air strikes against the Taliban, resulting in 220 deaths; 68 ground operations and 28 air strikes against members of the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani Network leading to 34 deaths; 43 ground operations against other insurgent networks causing 36 deaths) does not appear on the ground to have caused the Taliban to lose control of any territory. Our military has, however, been able to assist the ANDSF to recapture areas in Helmand province, the central province in the generation of opium-related income for the Taliban, government officials and local warlords. Such success, if built upon, may change both the economic and political situation.
“The commander of the allied forces in Afghanistan has stated that in two years’ time the Afghan government’s control will extend to 80 per cent of the population and leave only 10 per cent of the population under Taliban control. This is possible, but it remains to be seen if this optimistic assessment of the capabilities of the ANDSF, which will be in the lead for securing territorial gains, will prove equal to the task in the face of a determined enemy.
“Our policymakers have talked of supporting reconciliation and have acknowledged that only reconciliation, not military victory, is the way to bring stability to Afghanistan. We have not made public the efforts we have been making in this direction because the subject is delicate and public disclosures would sabotage rather than advance the process. We hope to use the five Afghans we released from Guantanamo in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl to establish substantive contact with the Taliban leaders, who are prepared for reconciliation. Also, since the process has to be Afghan-owned and Afghan-led, our role can only be advisory and provide our Afghan partners – those we deem trustworthy and sincere in pursuing this objective – with the intelligence we are able to gather. We and our Afghan friends have been fooled in the past by masqueraders and have to be cautious. More work is required in this respect.
“It is generally acknowledged that US efforts to improve the allied train and assist missions in support of the Afghan National Security forces (ANSF) are not matched by credible plans to build effective Afghan political unity, effective governance, and an economy that can win public support. We recognise that in the administration, as also in Congress, there is little support for ‘nation building’ but without some effort in this direction we cannot hope to have a stable Afghanistan. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s decimated State Department cannot, at least at this time, remedy this and the NUG’s own efforts in this direction are likely to flounder in the absence of substantive foreign financial and personnel resources being provided for ‘nation building’. This is the reality Congress and the administration have to contend with.”
My own view is that the economic situation in Afghanistan is such that there is no prospect of Afghanistan being able to survive without foreign assistance at least until 2030-35 and that, too, only if there is movement towards reconciliation, the enforcement of local ceasefires as part of reconciliation, and thus the creation of conditions for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline and Central Asia-South Asia (CASA-1000) electricity transmission line.
A ray of hope is offered by the Taliban’s open letter to the American people and President Trump on February 14, 2018 which states, “The Islamic Emirate had asked America from the very beginning to solve her issues with the Islamic Emirate through talk and dialogue … War is imposed on us; it is not our choice. Our preference is to solve the Afghan issue through peaceful dialogues.”
This is a refreshing contrast to the open letter to President Trump on August 15, 2017 in which the emphasis was different. It stated, “Mujahideen are wresting control of several districts from the corrupt regime in a one-week span and are seizing so much equipment that they can continue fighting for a long time. They can easily take control of all major highways of the country …” It had no mention of a readiness for dialogue.
This Taliban offer is, of course, for talks with the Americans and not with the NUG. Predictably, the NUG and the Americans have reiterated their oft-stated stance of reconciliation being an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process.
Perhaps over optimistically, I interpret the Taliban letter as a tacit acknowledgement of potential battlefield losses and a move towards eventual talks with the NUG by the Taliban’s titular leader Haibatullah Akhundzada. If it happens, the process will be long and tortuous but it may bring some measure of peace.

Title: 
One Haqqani militant killed, 5 arrested in eastern Afghanistan - Xinhua | English.news.cn

KABUL, March 11 (Xinhua) -- One member of Haqqani militant group was killed and five others were arrested in Afghanistan's eastern province of Wardak, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.
"Two Haqqani network key commanders named Obaid Ullah and Abdul Haq were arrested together with three other members of the group following a special operation in Tangi area, Sayyed Abad district, Wardak province Saturday night," the ministry said in a statement.
The operation began on specific intelligence information about the presence of militants in the village.
The Special Operations Police Forces surrounded the area, following which a gunfight was triggered and which continued for several hours.
A bomb-making expert of the group named Qari Ebrar was killed after the shootout, the statement added.
No security force or local villagers were injured in the province, 35 km west of Kabul.
The operation was the latest raids against the insurgency, its supply lines and militants' mid-level command structure.
As a Taliban-linked group of militants, the Haqqani network mostly operating in eastern provinces and capital Kabul, has been responsible for many high-profile attacks against security forces.
The network, which was designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 2012, has yet to make comments.

Title: Afghanistan: U.S. seeks 'real action' from Pakistan on militant groups

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has not yet seen Pakistan take significant steps to clamp down on the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militant groups, a senior U.S. administration official said on Friday.The administration suspended about $2 billion in security assistance to Pakistan in January but Islamabad has failed to take “the kind of decisive and irreversible action” Washington has asked for to help with the war in Afghanistan, the official told reporters.The administration has been frustrated by what it sees as Pakistan’s reluctance to act against the Afghan Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network. Washington believes the groups use Pakistan as a safe haven for launching attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan denies helping the militants.The United States has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001, making it America’s longest military conflict. President Donald Trump agreed in August to a stepped-up military campaign against the Taliban, and has since increased pressure on Pakistan to help. -Read MoreU.S. seeks 'real action' from Pakistan on militant groupsCar bomb kills at least three in Afghan capital

Title: U.S. estranged policy towards terrorists utilizing Pakistan: Backward step under Trump – Modern Tokyo Times

U.S. estranged policy towards terrorists utilizing Pakistan: Backward step under Trump
Murad Makhmudov and Lee Jay Walker
Modern Tokyo Times

Terrorist and sectarian forces blight Afghanistan based on internal issues and the external intrigues of Pakistan. Hence, it is a very estranged policy by America to declare that Sunni Islamist terrorists will rarely amount to being pursued into Pakistan. Equally, the Pentagon seems to be hinting that it is in the interest of Pakistan to protect regional nations including India. Therefore, just like America’s estranged approach to Turkey, the same can be said about Pakistan.
Under the former president of America, Barack Obama, the United States went into Pakistan in hot pursuit of the Haqqani Network and the Taliban. For example, in 2010 military helicopters from the United States killed at least 50 Sunni Islamist terrorists in Pakistan, belonging to the Haqqani Network. More famously, Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad the following year on the orders of Obama.
Another major incident under Obama is when attack helicopters from the United States killed 28 members of the armed forces of Pakistan in 2011. This happened when it appeared that the Pakistan army was providing cover for retreating Sunni Islamist terrorists belonging to the Taliban.
Therefore, the estranged policy of America appearing to give the Taliban, Haqqani Network, and others, the opportunity to utilize regional areas in Pakistan defies logic. After all, it is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is being destabilized on several fronts and this notably relates to the policies of Pakistan.
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews(Pajhwok Afghan News),a spokesperson at the Pentagon, said,“We have no authority to go into Pakistan.”
He continued,“Say, for example, we have troops in contact and then the Taliban forces go across the border… They are clearly inside Pakistan then. There’s no change with regards to respecting the territorial sovereignty of Pakistan.”
However, in the past American forces did enter Pakistan based on the“inherent right of self defense.”Equally important, Afghanistan wants a reassurance that Pakistan will be taken to task for its destabilization policy towards central forces based in Kabul. Therefore, with terrorist attacks being never-ending in Afghanistan along with growing sectarian attacks aimed at butchering the Shia, then the policy of America under President Donald Trump will not be welcomed by political elites based in Kabul.
Unbelievably, the Pentagon spokesperson indicated that the armed forces of America are optimistic that“Pakistan will take action because not only do we feel it is going to serve Afghanistan, but it’s going to help protect Pakistan, India and the entire region.”
The above statement will be met with scorn in many political and military circles in Afghanistan and India. After all, the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, Harakat-ul-Mujahideen, Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Mullah Nazir Group, and other Sunni Islamist terrorist and sectarian groups, operate openly in various parts of Pakistan. Therefore, Afghanistan and India have much to ponder based on the known intrigues of Pakistan and the estranged policy of America.
