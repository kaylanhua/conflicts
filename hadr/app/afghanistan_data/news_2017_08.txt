Title: Report: Iranian Commanders Fighting Alongside Taliban Inside Afghanistan
The influence of state sponsor of terrorism Iran is growing in Afghanistan, where mutual disdain towards the United States has brought together the Shiite Islamic Republic and the Sunni Taliban, two unlikely bedfellows.
“As the [U.S.-backed] NATO mission in Afghanistan expanded, the Iranians quietly began supporting the Taliban to bleed the Americans and their allies by raising the cost of the intervention so that they would leave,”reportstheNew York Times (NYT). “Iran has come to see the Taliban not only as the lesser of its enemies but also as a useful proxy force,” it adds.
“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, a former senior intelligence official who now serves as the governor of Farah province,” toldNYT.“The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”
Farah, located in western Afghanistan, sits along the Iranian border.
Citing Afghan officials, theTimesreveals that “Iran has sent [to Afghanistan] squads of assassins, secretly nurtured spies and infiltrated police ranks and government departments, especially in western [Afghan] provinces.”
“Iran has conducted an intensifying covert intervention, much of which is only now coming to light,” adds theTimes. “It is providing local Taliban insurgents with weapons, money, and training. It has offered Taliban commanders sanctuary and fuel for their trucks. It has padded Taliban ranks by recruiting among Afghan Sunni refugees in Iran, according to Afghan and Western officials.”
Some Iranian commanders were among the Taliban fatalities from a battle in Farah province last year.
“Four senior Iranian commandos were among the scores of dead, Afghan intelligence officials said, noting their funerals in Iran,” reportsNYT,referring to the October 2016 Taliban assault in Farah.
“Many of the Taliban dead and wounded were also taken back across the nearby border with Iran, where the insurgents had been recruited and trained, village elders told Afghan provincial officials,” it adds.
The Taliban coordinated the Farah offensive with attacks in other major cities, reportedly marking the terrorist group’s most ambitious attempt to regain power since 2001.
“It was also a piece of an accelerating Iranian campaign to step into a vacuum left by departing American forces—Iran’s biggest push into Afghanistan in decades,” notes theTimes, alluding to the assault.
Mutual hate towards the Sunni Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) has reportedlydrivenIran and the Taliban closer together.
Nevertheless, the Islamic Republic, like its ally Russia, denies lending support to the Taliban terrorists.
Iran has “facilitated” the relationship between Russia and the Taliban, “securing funds and weapons from Moscow for the insurgents” with the direct knowledge of Pakistan, reportsNYT.
A former Taliban commander told theTimeson condition of anonymity that former Taliban leader Mullah [Akhtar Muhammad] “Mansour’s cultivation of Iran for weapons was done with the full knowledge of Pakistan.”
Haji Agha Lalai, a presidential adviser who also serves as the deputy governor of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, later toldNYTthat Pakistan, eager to share the financial burden of backing the Taliban, has encouraged the terrorist group to strengthen its ties with Iran.
Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, the birthplace of the Taliban, lies on the Pakistan border.
The Taliban, Iran, and Russia, as well as Pakistan, appear to be pushing for the same outcome: the withdrawal of the United States from the Afghanistan region.
U.S. and Afghan officials have longaccusedPakistan of assisting the Taliban.
Mutual disapproval of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan was the original reason behind Iran and Afghanistan coming together.
“They [Iran] really don’t want American troops and influence in Afghanistan. They see it as their backyard. But they are also calculating; they want proxy forces that are loyal to them or at least controlled by them, that they have some leverage over,” Carlotta Gall, the author of the NYT article, told PBS Newshour. “So, that’s the calculation to help some of the Taliban that are local along their area. They also really want to hurt America, and that’s their ultimate aim — to bleed them, as we wrote, and to push them out eventually.”
A Taliban member told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the “sole” reason behind cooperation between Russia and the Taliban is to expel the United States from Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has warned against the Taliban’s relationship with Iran, Russia, and Pakistan.

Title: Ralph Nader: The 16 Year War In Afghanistan, Headlines Tell The Story – OpEd – Eurasia Review

Ralph Nader
ByRalph Nader
Since 2001 the US has been at War in Afghanistan – the longest war in US history. Headlines concisely tell the story of this cruel boomeranging quagmire of human violence and misery. Below are some newspaper headlines from 2010 to the present to show that a militarized foreign policy without Congress exercising its Constitutional duties and steadfast public engagement will drift on, costing our soldiers’ lives and limbs, nearly three-quarters of a trillion taxpayer dollars, hundreds of thousands of Afghani lives and millions of refugees, with no end in sight.

Title: US confirms receiving open letter of Afghan Taliban
WASHINGTON: Confirming open letter to President Donald Trump from Afghan Taliban, US State Department believes the situation in Afghanistan was a result of the Taliban themselves.
In a news briefing, State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed receiving Taliban’s open letter to US President and said, “What is going on in Afghanistan is a result of the Taliban.”
Reply to a question about withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, the spokesperson said, “There are a lot of various options on the table that the U.S. government is considering as it reviews its Afghan policy.”
In an open letter to US President Donald Trump, Afghan Taliban asked US to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan. The letter says, “The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!”, adding that the only reason preventing Taliban from seizing major cities is the fear of massive civilian casualties.
According to Reuters, the decision to address Trump directly was purposefully timed to coincide with the US president’s options on US policy in Afghanistan.
In a detailed letter written in English-language, the Taliban said, "Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might."
Calling the Afghan government as ‘stooges’ and “lying, corrupt leaders”, the letter said that they were providing a false picture of the military situation in Afghanistan.
The Taliban in Afghanistan intending to restore Islamic rule have been waging a violent insurgency  against the Western-backed Afghan government.
"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation," the Taliban letter elaborated.
"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors."

Title: Taliba In Afghanistan
Coordinates:33°N65°E﻿/﻿33°N 65°E﻿/33; 65
Afghanistani/æfˈɡænᵻstæn/(Pashto/Dari:افغانستان,Afġānistān), officially theIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, is alandlocked countrylocated withinSouth AsiaandCentral Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the42ndmost populous country in the world. It is bordered byPakistanin the south and east;Iranin the west;Turkmenistan,Uzbekistan, andTajikistanin the north; andChinain the far northeast. Its territory covers652,000km2(252,000sqmi), making it the41st largestcountry in the world.
Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to theMiddle PaleolithicEra, and the country'sstrategiclocation along theSilk Roadconnected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. Through the ages the land has been home to various peoples and witnessed numerous military campaigns; notably byAlexander the Great,Muslim Arabs,Mongols,British,Soviet Russians, and in the modern-era byWestern powers. The land also served as the source from which theKushans,Hephthalites,Samanids,Saffarids,Ghaznavids,Ghorids,Khiljis,Mughals,Hotaks,Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires.

TheWar in Afghanistan(or theAmerican war in Afghanistan) is the period in which the United States invadedAfghanistanafter theSeptember 11 attacks. Supported initially by close allies, they were later joined byNATObeginning in 2003. It followed theAfghan Civil War's 1996–2001 phase. Its public aims were to dismantleal-Qaedaand to deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing theTalibanfrom power. Key allies, including the United Kingdom, supported the U.S. from the start to the end of the phase. This phase of the War is thelongest warin United States history.
In 2001, U.S. PresidentGeorge W. Bushdemanded that the Taliban hand overOsama bin Ladenand expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the United Nations since 1999. The Taliban declined toextraditehim unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks and declined demands to extradite other terrorism suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the U.S. as a delaying tactic, and on 7 October 2001 it launchedOperation Enduring Freedomwith theUnited Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including theNorthern Alliance. In December 2001, theUnited Nations Security Councilestablished theInternational Security Assistance Force(ISAF), to assist the Afghan interim authorities with securing Kabul. At theBonn Conferencein December 2001,Hamid Karzaiwas selected to head theAfghan Interim Administration, which after a2002 loya jirgainKabulbecame theAfghan Transitional Administration. In thepopular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named theIslamic Republic of Afghanistan.
Afghanis-tan(あふがにすタン,Afuganisu-tan, see note on name below)orAfghanistanis a Japaneseyonkomamanga, originally published as awebcomic, by Timaking (ちまきing).  It is also the name of the heroine of the manga. The manga is nicknamedAfgan(あふがん,Afugan)
Afghanis-tanillustrates the modernhistory of Afghanistanand its neighboring countries, starting from theimperialistera in the 19th century, throughmoe anthropomorphism. The title character, a short and clumsybishōjo, is anational personificationofAfghanistan. Other female characters personify the nearby nations ofCentral Asia, such asPakistanandUzbekistan. Nations that have fought wars in Afghanistan at various times, such asBritain, theSoviet Unionand theUnited Statesalso make appearances. TheTalibangovernment andAl-Qaedaterrorist group are also represented in the comic.
Eachyonkomastrip is accompanied by an "Afghan Memo" that explains in prose some of the background and history of the nations depicted. Additional pages give short biographies of the characters.

Title: Afghan Taliban warns Donald Trump against sending in more troops to Afghanistan | World News - The Indian Express
The Taliban told US President Donald Trump in an open letter on Tuesday that the military situation in Afghanistan was “far worse than you realize”, and sending in more troops would be self-destructive. A senior Taliban official told Reuters the rare decision to address Trump directly was timed to coincide with the president’s deliberations on the future of US policy in Afghanistan. “Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,” the Taliban said in the lengthy English-language letter.
It criticized the Afghan government as “stooges”, “lying, corrupt leaders” and “repulsive sellouts” who were providing Washington with “rosy pictures” of the military position. The Taliban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, has waged an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led invasion after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Those attacks were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from a base in Afghanistan. “The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!” the letter said, arguing that the only thing preventing the Taliban from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.
The senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces. Influential voices including Republican Senator John McCain have also urged an “enduring” US military presence in Afghanistan.
But such plans have faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.
US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that the Trump administration was “very, very close” to a decision on Afghanistan, adding that all options were on the table. However, US officials believe it could take weeks for a South Asia strategy to be approved.
“We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,” the Taliban told Trump.
“A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.”
Some Taliban leaders disagreed with publishing the letter as they believe the group is close to being able to end the war on its own terms, while the “Americans are no longer in a position to fight this never-ending war,” one Taliban official said.
The first official said the Taliban was open to “discuss all issues with the United States for bringing peace to Afghanistan” if American troops are withdrawn. “Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,” the Taliban letter said. “The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.”

Title: Vanquished from Mosul, Islamic State preys on jobless Afghans in search of new territory
Kabul:As unemployment worsens in strife-torn Afghanistan, the Islamic State (IS) has arrived to help the jobless with a lucrative new profession: terrorism.
The insurgent group has made significant headway in Afghanistan and is recruiting local villagers, as well as its enemy—the Taliban—to paid jobs in order to expand its influence across the north, according to local Afghan officials.
Hundreds of local villagers from remote areas of the Faryab and Jawzjan provinces and several Taliban commanders with more than 300 fighters have pledged allegiance to the IS in the past six months, Mohammad Sami Khairkhowah, the head of provincial council of Faryab, said by phone. They are paid above $500 monthly, thrice the wage of a government soldier, he said.
Several Afghan lawmakers confirmed the issue and expressed deep frustration over government’s inability to stop it. The group is recruiting people “openly and publicly” in the region, Abdul Rauf Ibrahimi, the speaker of Lower House of Parliament, told lawmakers in a June session.
The revelations come as US President Donald Trump struggles to define an Afghanistan policy and weighs an increase in troop levels in Afghanistan. US generals have recommended adding as many as 5,000 troops to about 8,400 already there to train and assist Afghan forces. Defence Secretary James Mattis told American lawmakers in June that the US is not winning the 16-year-long war.
Regional recruitment
The recruitment process is led by Qari Hekmatullah, who’s been identified by the Afghan government as the regional leader of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). He operates in the deserts of Dahst-e-Laili and mountains of Darzab district in Jawzjan province, which share a border with Faryab, Khairkhowah said.
“ISKP’s aim is to establish a presence in the increasingly volatile north of Afghanistan and highlights the resilience of a group, which has recently lost leaders, fighters and territory,” said Viraj Solanki, a research analyst for south Asia at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, via email. The group’s “appeal and brand is attractive for fighters, and the financial gains are also attractive for local villagers”.
Their recruitment drive, along with the growing Taliban presence in the region, “multiplies the challenges” for President Ashraf Ghani, Solanki said, and will determine “the nature of future US policy towards Afghanistan”.
Spillover feared
The insurgents lost ground in their first-established foothold in the eastern Nangarhar province and in the south after operations by Afghan and US forces. A US airstrike killed the group’s third leader Abu Sayed as well as his four senior advisers, US military officials in Kabul said on 31 July. And in April, the US dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on Islamic State hideouts in Nangarhar, killing as many as 100.
However, it’s feared the group may expand further into the country’s north. For the first time since their emergence in 2014, it gained control of the Darzab district in June. Among the former Taliban commanders who switched allegiance to the Islamic State are Maulavi Assadullah, Mullah Sufi Qayum and Mullah Nemat Mufti, who brought with him 200 armed fighters.
The IS targets young men who failed to find a government job or whose farm work does not cover their family expenses, lawmaker Fawzia Raufi, who represents Faryab in the Lower House of Parliament, said by phone.
Others who leave the Taliban may simply see better opportunities with ISKP, said Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, Omar Zakhilwal. “Within the Taliban, it’s not just one unified ideological group that will stick to its core instructions, there are lots fighters of opportunity, or of varying beliefs,” he said in Islamabad last week.
On 5 August, Islamic State militants teamed up with newly-formed Taliban groups to attack Mirza Olang village in Sar-e Pul province, killing more than 50 people, according to Zabihullah Amani, the provincial spokesman.
Record deaths
Security incidents by militants jumped 21% from March through May compared with the previous quarter, with more than 5,000 civilians killed or wounded in the first half of 2017, according to a July report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US watchdog. At least 2,531 Afghan forces were killed and 4,238 wounded from January through May, the report said.
Meanwhile, the amount of territory under government authority was down to about 60%, six percentage points less than a year earlier, with the rest controlled or contested by Taliban and other militants, according to the report.
The US-led Nato forces commander Gen. John Nicholson declared in June that the size of IS had been reduced by two-thirds to 750 militants nationwide and vowed to eliminate them by year’s end.
Still, Solanki said, “if they are able to establish a significant presence” in the north, it will “present a new challenge for the Afghan forces and US forces’ aim to defeat ISKP in 2017”.
More than half of Faryab province is threatened by the presence of both militant groups, said the local lawmaker, Raufi.
“They’re trying to embolden their strength with the recruitment of jobless villagers and the Taliban,” Raufi said. “If that’s not prevented, the entire north will be under significant threat because Faryab is the gateway to the region.”Bloombergs

Title: The Bob Livingston Letter®
Dear Valued Reader:
In less than a decade of reckless government expansion, the fundamentals of successful investing, planning and living have undergone a dramatic and potentially dangerous transformation.The ground has literally changed under your feet!
The number of complex legal, regulatory, medical and retiree-unfriendly tax traps has mushroomed to the point that ignorance is downright dangerous. And with President Biden’s newest multi-trillion dollar “social safety net” tax hike, it’s about to get worse. The upshot is cash-hungry bureaucrats are now looking for full control over everything from cash in the bank to private retirement assets held anywhere they can get their hands on it. And they want to suppress alternative asset protection and wealth building information that can make people more self-reliant — like the kind in this letter.
To prosper in Biden’s America (yes, it’s still possible and I’ll show you how), you need to consider some new developments and plan accordingly. The information I want to send you is essential to anyone who wants to protect their wealth, prepare for their retirement or is already in retirement.
I am convinced that the U.S. is now facing some of the most serious economic and political threats in its history. After nearly 40 years of unprecedented prosperity, the U.S. economy is now in shambles.
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs… their life savings… and soon it will be their homes. While the U.S. military remains the most powerful force in the world, the most immediate threats America now faces are closer to home.
These include:Companies forced out of business… soaring government spending that will lead to hyperinflation… runaway taxes… older citizens no longer able to retire and live what used to be known as “their golden years.”And more…
Fortunately, you DON’T have to just sit by and do nothing. There are simple, easy, inexpensive steps you can take right now to protect your family. BUT…
Have you packed away every penny you legally can for your retirement? If cash-hungry Federal bureaucrats dilute the value of IRAs and other retirement accounts, would you be affected? What is your exposure to and what preparations have you made for the coming housing bubble collapse?
You deserve to be just as protected against the coming inflation wave as any tech giant or financial titan of Wall Street. That’s why I want to send you the inside information and strategies they already know, before it’s too late.
As I am about to show you with shocking urgency, now is the time to make basic preparations to come out ahead in the collapsing value of dollar-denominated assets — to not be a victim or a sucker. I have no intention of being either, and I know you feel the same way.
At the end of this letter, I will tell you how to get the newest, most authoritative source of information about hidden inflation, how it is ripping you off and what you can do to protect yourself. TheUltimate Hyperinflation Defense Manualis probably among the most important guides I have ever offered. You can’t find this information anywhere else and you haven’t a moment to lose.
As the editor ofThe Bob Livingston Letter®, I pay very close attention to recently resigned or soon-to-be-departed high-level U.S. officials (once they are out of office many are remarkably candid — even as the “mainstream” media stop reporting their words). In my experience, recently-retired officials often hint at dangers to come, leaving a trail of “breadcrumbs” in which Americans like you and I should pay close attention.
That’s why it’s so important to note the departing warning of former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan (a man noted for understatement) — who flatly told Congress“serious economic disruptions are in the works”due to trillions of dollars in Federal obligations that will be visited upon taxpayers and retirees like a gigantic balloon payment. And that was well before the trillions in helicopter money started raining down on America.
Now listen to Former Fed Chair Paul Volker who presided over 70’s-era inflation and was even more blunt. He warned that the chances of an all-out dollar collapse due to runaway spending were greater than 50-50.
These former insiders are referring to a level of unfunded liability by the Federal government which is so gigantic as to boggle the mind. To give you some idea of the scope of this problem, the government would have to extract $473,000 from each and every U.S. household to cover the rapidly approaching national balloon payment on unfunded liabilities!
Obviously, something is going to have to “give.” This is why I want to rush you information on how Treasury bureaucrats are forming emergency “contingency” plans to freeze IRA and 401(k) accounts in the event of a national financial panic — similar to the “banking holidays” used by the Franklin Roosevelt administration to bilk millions of Americans during the Great Depression.
You especially need this expanded, updated and revised manual because “passive” retirement planning is a thing of the past. To get the most out of your life over 50, you can no longer listen to only one or two paid “experts,” make your house payments and “assume” the best. It’s not enough anymore, not by a long shot! This is true if you’re 10-15 years away from retirement and particularly if you are already in retirement. (The latter group has even more to lose through inaction.)
In the past few months, prices have been skyrocketing. Lumber prices have almost tripled. Real estate is soaring. Prices for some commodities have shot through the roof. And let’s not even talk about the grocery store… but don’t be fooled! The current, temporary period of inflation will soon be followed by even more massive inflation. That’s because President Biden and his allies in Congress have embarked on the biggest government spending spree in history. This socialistic expansion of government will inevitably lead to a devaluation of the U.S. dollar (hyperinflation) that could wipe out your life savings.
Imagine a world of $20 per gallon of gasoline… $50 hamburgers… and average housing rentals costing $10,000 a month or more. The economic stimulus packages of the last few years alone will amount to $6 trillion…nearly 7 timeswhat the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) program spent! And the stimulus plan is only the tip of the iceberg!
When you add in the unfunded liabilities, that’strillions the government doesn’t have over the next few years.Whether the government borrows it or prints it, an increase that big in the money supply is going to do only one thing: Send inflation through the roof! The last time the U.S. government tried to spend its way out of a recession (in the 1970s) the inflation rate increased by 500%!
The Ultimate Hyperinflation Defense Manual is probably among the most important guides I have ever offered. You can’t find this information anywhere else and you have my personal word of honor you’ll be glad you accepted my special offer below. Why? It will bring you up to speed on:
Accelerating inflation is a threat to your future comfort, big time! It means your stock portfolio is worth less than you think or need. It also reduces your future ability to pay for fuel, electricity, food, healthcare and other basic daily needs. And it is especially merciless to people who assume they can live comfortably on a fixed income.
Analyst John Williams of the remarkablewww.shadowstats.comwebsite cites credible evidence of more than a 10% inflation rate instead of the government’s reported sub-2% rate. He notes, “The basic elements for a dollar collapse and an eventual hyperinflationary environment in the U.S. remain locked in place.” Williams reports inflation is over 11% right now (not the paltry 2% the Fed claims) and is about to take off, back above those pre-1981 levels you see below!
Even the normally bullish, pro-Wall Street editorial page ofThe Wall Street Journalconceded, “Fasten your seat belts and get ready for morebumpy flying in the Fed’s cloudy skies.”
In addition to side-stepping fake paper asset and bogus investment landmines, this manual offers extremely useful guidance on how to vastly improve your financial situation —because it shows you how the ground has changed under your feet and the precise steps you must take to prepare for what is to come! You need theUltimate Hyperinflation Defense Manualbecause it contains information the Wall Street media will NEVER share with you, such as:
Isn’t this the kind of hands-on information you need to successfully navigate through the increasingly treacherous waters of your financial future? TheUltimate Hyperinflation Defense Manualis the ultimate protocol and guide… and a reference you can use for preserving your wealth for life.

Title: Afghanistan: Deadly Attack on Mosque a War Crime | Human Rights Watch
ISIS Affiliates Target Shia Minority

(New York) – Theattack on a Shia mosquein Kabul claimed by the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) on August 25, 2017, is a serious violation of the laws of war, and an apparent war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. The hours-long attack on the Imam Zaman mosque in the Qala-e Najara neighborhood of northern Kabul killed at least 20 people and wounded at least 30 others, media reports said.The attackers, reportedlywearing police uniforms, initiated the assault with a grenade attack and then entered the mosque and fired on worshipers. Gun battles continued for several hours. An armed group claiming allegiance to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP)reportedly claimed responsibility.“An attack on a place of worship during prayers is a horrific crime meant to maximize civilian deaths,” saidPatricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan researcher. “This contemptible act against a religious minority, claimed by ISIS’s Afghan affiliate, is a grim reminder that civilians bear the brunt of Afghanistan’s war.”

Title: 'Rare Cooperation': Islamic State, Taliban Execute Joint Attack in Afghanistan
The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and the Taliban, an al-Qaeda ally, stand accused again of joining forces to carry out a deadly terrorist attack in Afghanistan that left up to 50 mostly Shiite civilians dead and hundreds of others in captivity last week.
Agence France-Presse (AFP)notesthat the incident highlights “rare cooperation” between the two groups, which have been engaged invariousturf battles since ISIS established a presence in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region back in January 2015.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)reports:
Taliban and IS [Islamic State] fighters working together in a rare joint operation killed around 50 men, women, and children in the mainly Shi’ite village on August 5 after overrunning a government-backed militia in a two-day battle, according to local officials, who also said they took about 150 families captive.
The Taliban denies it was a joint operation, saying a group under one of its commanders carried out the attack.
Nevertheless, RFE/RL learned that local villagers reported seeing jihadists flaunting the white banner of the Taliban and the black banner of ISIS during the attack, which took place in a remote village in northern Afghanistan’s Sar-e Pul Province.
The Pentagon believes many of the ISIS fighters in Afghanistan are believed to be defectors from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which has foughtalongsideal-Qaeda and the Taliban against U.S.-led troops. Uzbekistan is located north of Afghanistan, close to Sar-e Pul Province where the joint ISIS-Taliban attack took place.
Zabihullah Amani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, told AFP that the local Taliban commander has pledged allegiance to ISIS.
ISIS jihadists haveengagedin battle with their Taliban counterparts in the past, competing for territory, influence, and fighters in Afghanistan.
“Taliban and IS fighters have regularly clashed in Afghanistan over the past two years, but security sources say they have teamed up in the past to strike Afghan forces in certain areas,” reports RFE/RL.
AFP learned from an unnamed Afghan security source that, although the terrorists released 235 captives, there are still an estimated 100 people being held hostage by the Taliban and ISIS jihadists.
“This evening, 235 people, including women and children, were released from Mirza Olang as a result of mediation by the local elders and provincial officials,” Zabihullah Amani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, told AFP.
U.S. and Afghan officials have repeatedly alleged that ISIS and the Taliban have collaborated on terrorist attacks, a claim that both groups have denied.
“It is completely wrong, it is propaganda of our enemy, ISIS is our enemy, there is no ISIS in Sar-e-Pul. Our commander in Sar-e-Pul is called Ghazanfar, who is not an ISIS,” Zabiullah Mojahid, a Taliban spokesman, toldCNN.
Nevertheless, theIndependentcites local officials as indicating the two groups decapitated many of the people recently killed in the northern Afghan province.
Echoing the U.S. military, Hanif Atmar, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s national security adviser,toldtheTimes of India (TOI), in March, “This idea that Taliban and Daesh are opposed to each other is wrong.”
In December 2016, Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan,toldreporters that Russia’s allegation that “the Taliban are the ones fighting Islamic State … is not based on fact.”
Gen. Nicholson acknowledged that ISIS and the Taliban reached a truce in eastern Afghanistan.
The commander has conceded that the majority of ISIS terrorists in Afghanistan were at some point members of the Pakistani Taliban, officially known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Although the two groups are affiliated, the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban consider themselves two distinct groups, which operate under different leaders.
Still, both organizations are linked to al-Qaeda, which is considered an ISIS rival.
ISIS, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda are all Sunni groups. Late last year, Nicholson revealed, ISIS’s Afghan branch “is formed of members of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and even some former members of the Afghan Taliban.”

Title: Why Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan is the disaster you'd expect it to be | Salon.com
This article originally appeared onAlterNet

On August 21, President Donald Trump announced that he plans to send more thousands of U.S. troops to Afghanistan to extend the American war that began in 2001. The speech Trump gave has no details, only a tweetable line: ‘We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.’
Three days later, Trump’s senior general in Afghanistan, John Nicholson, said that the United States military would crush ISIS in Afghanistan. The Taliban, General Nicholson said, should come to the negotiation table, while the U.S. would expand its attack on ISIS and al-Qaeda. It is therefore reasonable to assume that when Trump said he wants the U.S. military to kill terrorists, he meant ISIS and al-Qaeda, not the Taliban.
The U.S. currently has as many as 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, most of whom provide various kinds of support to the Afghan National Army. The Afghan Army suffers from poor morale as a consequence of erratic pay, poor logistics and an unclear mandate. Its war against the Taliban has been fruitless, as the Taliban’s legions have control now over about half of Afghanistan’s districts. The Taliban is so confident of its strength that in May it released a report showing that it fully controls 34 districts and 16 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces.
In late July, the Taliban pushed the Afghan National Army out of Faryab, Ghor and Paktia. These areas are in Afghanistan’s northwest, center and southeast, proving that the Taliban is able to dominate areas far outside what had been assumed to be its base in the southern half of the country. A few days ago, Taliban fighters seized Sari Pul province’s Sayad district and more of Faryab province. The Afghan National Army will soon be the Kabul Army if this rate of expansion by the Taliban continues.
Terrorists
Rumors that the Taliban has collaborated with ISIS in some parts of the country have been denied by Taliban commanders. They would like to maintain some distance between themselves and ISIS, which has now become a central target for the U.S. forces.
Weakly positioned in Afghanistan, ISIS is restricted largely to Nangarhar province, where the U.S. had previously dropped the "Mother of All Bombs." A key report from the United Nations on August 7 showed that ISIS in Afghanistan is not a viable threat. ‘Despite its recruitment efforts over the past three years,’ the U.N. Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team noted, ‘the group has not yet established a viable fighting force there.’
Money for ISIS in Afghanistan, the U.N. team notes, comes from Iraq and Syria. ‘Sometimes the financial flows are robust and other times they run dry.’ It is this money from Iraq and Syria that pushes ISIS to conduct such operations as the suicide attack on the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul in late July. ISIS in Afghanistan is less a threat to the United State or to Afghanistan itself than it is being used by its Iraqi and Syrian branch to put pressure on their adversaries (such as the Iraqi government) in Afghanistan.
It is now well-known that the Taliban has been able to absorb the best of al-Qaeda’s fighting force from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. ‘Many al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area,’ the U.N. report notes, ‘have integrated into the Taliban, leading to a marked increase in the military capabilities of the movement.’ There are now estimated to be 7,000 al-Qaeda fighters, most of them from outside Afghanistan, in the Taliban ranks.
Al-Qaeda has been under pressure from the Pakistani military in the borderlands, which is why its fighters have moved into southern Afghanistan and to the Idlib province in Syria — both seen by the al-Qaeda leadership as key places for its expansion. Two important al-Qaeda leaders who came from Egypt to Afghanistan — Abu al-Khayr al-Masri and Rifai Ahmed Taha—died in Idlib (Syria) in February and April. They had been sent by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to strengthen the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Al-Qaeda leaders Qari Yasin was killed in Paktia (Afghanistan), where he had been sent by al-Zawahiri to unite the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces.
Nation-building
The upsurge of the Taliban has nothing to do with the presence of ISIS in Afghanistan. It does, however, have a great deal to do with the entry of al-Qaeda fighters of various stripes from Pakistan into its ranks. But even al-Qaeda is not central to the Taliban’s surge.
That surge can only be explained by the slow desiccation of the Afghan government in Kabul. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world (31%) and half of Afghanistan’s children are stunted with a third of the population suffering from food insecurity.
The collapse of humane aspirations for the Afghan people certainly fuels the insurgency and the violence, making it harder to build state and social institutions to tackle these key problems, which once more fuels the war. This cycle of chaos could only be ended if regional powers agreed to freeze their interventions in Afghanistan and if the Afghan state would be able to robustly build up the infrastructure to feed and educate its citizens.
Trump’s comment that he is against ‘nation-building’ shows how little he understands war, for the only antidote to this endless American war in Afghanistan is for the people to reconcile around a believable mandate for human development rather than violence and corruption. No such agenda is on the table.
Negotiations
Late in July, before Trump made his recent announcement, one of Afghanistan’s most hardened leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, held a press conference in his home in Kabul. Hekmatyar, who was a key CIA and Pakistani ally in the 1970s and '80s, said that ‘neither the Afghan government nor foreign troops can win the war. This war has no winner.' This is remarkable coming from Hekmatyar, who was known as the ‘Butcher of Kabul’ for his role in the siege of that city after the Soviet troops left Afghanistan (more Afghans died in that civil war than in the mujahideen’s war against the communist government and their Soviet ally). He has called for negotiations between the Kabul government and the Taliban.
U.S. General Nicholson painted the Taliban as ‘a criminal organization, more interested in profits from drugs, kidnapping, murder for hire,’ but nonetheless called upon them to join a peace process. It is clear that whatever the U.S. thinks of the Taliban, they have positioned themselves to be a major political force in Afghanistan in the near future. This is why Nicholson and Trump have begun to distinguish between the Taliban (which should be in a peace process) and ISIS/al-Qaeda (which have to be destroyed). That al-Qaeda is now a key ally of the Taliban should sully this simplistic thinking. But it has not.
Negotiations seem far off in Afghanistan. The Taliban is well positioned to increase its bargaining power as its legions expand across the country. Surrendered Taliban leader Zangal Pacha (Amir Khan) recently left the fight in Nangarhar province with six fighters. He said that a foreign intelligence service — most likely that of Pakistan — has been egging the Taliban onwards to take more territory. Attacks on tribal elders and public welfare projects are being urged, largely to squeeze Kabul’s hold on the provinces and to strengthen the Taliban’s claim to being the natural rulers of Afghanistan. Pakistan has long wanted a friendly government in Kabul and it has seen the Taliban as its instrument. Whether the U.S. will once more turn a blind eye to al-Qaeda’s role in the Taliban is to be seen. History does repeat itself, particularly when it comes to geopolitical hypocrisy.
Meanwhile, violence continues to rattle Kabul. On August 24, a magnetic bomb in a land cruiser exploded in Sarai Shamail, wounding one person. Other stories interrupt this constant theme of Afghanistan and war. In Paktia’s Mirzakai district, tribal leaders have for years signed agreements to prevent the Taliban from entering their area. On the same day as the bomb blast, the leaders pledged to fine those who collaborate with the Taliban one million Afghanis ($15,000) and to ‘oust them from the district,’ said Khan Mangal.
Trump needs to attend to the tribal leaders of Mirzakai — people such as Khan Mangal, Haji Halim and Enzir Gul as well as women leaders such as Halima Ehsas, Halima Khazan, Dr. Nazdana Paktiawal and Feroza. But he does not know that they exist. For Trump, Afghanistan is not a place. It is merely a battlefield for an endless American war.

Title: 
	Trump Outlines the Foundation of a Changed Approach in Afghanistan | American Enterprise Institute - AEI
ByFrederick W. Kagan
AEIdeas
August 22, 2017
President Trump’s decision to recommit to Afghanistan was right and important. He explained the stakes of the fight accurately: to prevent al Qaeda and ISIS from regaining the base from which al Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks and from which both would plan and conduct major attacks against the US and its allies in the future. He also described the minimum required outcome: an Afghan state able to secure its own territory with very limited support from the US and other partners. This outcome is essential to American security and it is achievable.

Recent commentary has cast doubt on the feasibility of any kind of success in Afghanistan. The doubts are understandable, but their framing is incorrect. Yes, America has had troops in Afghanistan for 16 years. But it is wrong to suggest the US has been pursuing a single policy or strategy in that time, and equally wrong to suggest that no progress has been made.
Related reading:A New Strategy Against ISIS and Al Qaeda
American forces and Afghan partners toppled the Taliban quickly in 2001 and chased the remnants of al Qaeda from the country the next year. Continued American involvement prevented al Qaeda from ever re-establishing bases in Afghanistan on a scale remotely like those they had before 9/11 — that is an important accomplishment that is very much at risk now.
The US and the international community focused on helping the Afghans set up a new government and on economic reconstruction between 2002 and 2005 — a small number of American forces continued to operate against al Qaeda attempts to re-enter the country, but not against the Taliban, which was reconstituting in Pakistan. That policy has also had important effects measured in the rapidly-lengthening average lifespans of Afghans, boys and girls going to school, the proliferation of modern communications, access to healthcare, and so on — all at risk, again, if Afghanistan collapses.
Continued American involvement prevented al Qaeda from ever re-establishing bases in Afghanistan on a scale remotely like those they had before 9/11 — that is an important accomplishment that is very much at risk now.
The Taliban launched its large-scale insurgency in 2005, steadily expanding its capabilities within Afghanistan over the following few years. But the US and NATO refused to recognize that it now faced an insurgency and instead remained focused on development, counter-terrorism operations, and efforts to build a very small Afghan military and police force on a NATO model.
America’s view of the fight changed dramatically only in 2009 as the result of the McChrystal review, which compelled both the Obama Administration and, more reluctantly, NATO, to accept that a full-blown insurgency was underway, that a counter-insurgency strategy resourced with significant numbers of American and NATO troops was needed, and that the plans for building the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) had to be dramatically expanded and changed.
The ensuing few years saw several hundred thousand Afghans brought into the new security forces and sent to fight the Taliban while American troops and their allies helped clear Taliban strongholds and provided critical enablers (air support, artillery, intelligence collection and analysis, communications, medical services, and so on) to the ANSF.
The new plan for building the ANSF recognized the inevitable trade-off between trying to construct a small, professional force with everything it might need to fight and building a large infantry force that could put a lot of soldiers in the field quickly but relied on American and NATO help for more advanced capabilities. It rightly chose the latter approach, and Afghan troops began to bear the brunt of the actual fighting as American troops drew down starting in 2011.
The decision to focus on getting Afghans into the fight assumed that the US would continue to provide those key enablers for a long time — but President Obama chose not to do so. He largely stripped the ANSF of American enablers when he reduced the American footprint to its current level, forcing the Afghans to fight the Taliban on even terms, which neither they nor the US had expected they would have to do.

The deterioration in the military situation that ensued should have surprised no one — the Taliban had prepared to take advantage of the reduction in the US presence that President Obama had said when announcing the surge in 2009 would occur in starting in 2011, and the ANSF struggled without the high-end support it could not possibly replace.
Afghans continued to fight hard against the Taliban, and have held on to key gains made during the surge period. Central Kandahar and the central Helmand River Valley have not yet fallen to the Taliban despite massive Taliban campaigns to take them. Kabul is under threat, but the Taliban has not yet recreated the near strangle-hold it had on the capital in 2009. Taliban and ISIS attempts to gain control of the critical province of Nangarhar have made more progress than is acceptable, but have been repulsed before seizing really vital areas.
The security situation is nevertheless very fragile and deteriorating. The ANSF has been reactive, unable to formulate and conduct offensives of its own. Stripped of American enablers, it has been unable to respond adequately when the Taliban has launched multiple operations at the same time. It faces growing threats from new international terrorist organizations, moreover, including ISIS, pushing into areas that the ANSF is unable to protect and taking advantage of local and national schisms. It will not be able to continue to hold onto gains, or even hold the Afghan state together, without urgent additional help.
As General Petraeus said of Iraq, “hard is not hopeless.”
Afghanistan suffers from multiple challenges beyond ANSF capability as well, including a dysfunctional government (partially imposed upon it by the US after the contested elections of 2014); the fragmentation following the death of key leaders of the Northern Alliance of Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras that has been a key partner for the US since the 1980s; and the deterioration of security in the previously relatively peaceful north. There is still no agreed-upon political accommodation among the vast majority of Afghans who reject the Taliban, moreover — the people whom we most need to support. But there is no reason to despair of meeting these challenges. As General Petraeus said of Iraq, “hard is not hopeless.”
The policy President Trump just announced is yet another change in the kaleidoscopic strategy the US has pursued in Afghanistan since 9/11, but it is largely a positive one. It seeks to reverse the focus on withdrawal that characterized Obama’s approach after 2011, recognizes the importance of trying to win in Afghanistan, attempts to establish a reasonable definition of success, and begins to make available the resources necessary to achieve such a success.
President Trump’s announcement and strategy are not without flaws. The new approach remains, at least publicly, vague and lacking details. The president offered no political strategy for Afghanistan and did not adequately describe the process by which a political strategy would be developed. The number of US forces being discussed as reinforcements this year (around 4,000) seems too low to be decisive. Everyone is right to be dubious about what pressure on Pakistan can actually achieve.
Yet, for all that, it offers a foundation on which a successful strategy can be built. It gets important things right — the importance of the theater to American vital national security interests, the re-commitment of the US to this fight, the willingness to adjust strategy and resources to changing conditions on the ground, and the belief that success remains both necessary and possible. We should support fulfilling these real national security requirements while making every effort to improve the new strategy so that it can succeed.

We should support fulfilling these real national security requirements while making every effort to improve the new strategy so that it can succeed.

Title: Afghanistan’s Political Climate: Insecurity And Fragmentation – OpEd – Eurasia Review
A Journal of Analysis and News

Since 1979 Afghanistan has been victim to foreign intervention, regional meddling, and internal contention over power and resources. These different factors are all interplaying within the fabric of local and ethnic cleavages that are used by non-state actors for their own personal interests. To counter these challenges and build long-term stability, the role of a strong and unified Afghan Government is everso important- an element that is absent in the current National Unity Government led by President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Dr. Abdullah.
The NUG has made some strides in its efforts to provide stability and reduce the threat of insurgent activities on the civilian population. The launch of the Independent Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee was a sign of progress in the NUGs battle against the rampant corruption the state faces. Furthermore, with the help of foreign aid and international support, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have been successful in not letting any densely populated city fall to the Taliban. However, the U.S. Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) records that only 57.2% of 375 districts were under Afghan government control or influence on February 1 2017, a 15% decrease since the end of 2015.
In the First Quarter of the 2017 Civilian Casualty Data, UNAMA reports that the number of internally displaced people in Afghanistan was at a staggering 1.4 million, double the number in 2014. Many of these individuals are fleeing their homes due to being severely impacted by the conflict, thus seeking safer areas where they can relocate. Till date, there has been no reliable agreement on the peace process between the NUG and the Taliban. This has resulted in increasing insurgent-related attacks in densely populated areas. UNAMA records that approximately 60% of civilian casualties in 2016 were caused by Taliban and other armed insurgency groups. Moreover, the indiscriminate violent nature of the attacks by the insurgency groups through their increased usage of IEDs have posed substantial risk to civilians. The June Security Council Report on Afghanistan in 2017 indicated a total of 2181 civilian casualties, of which 715 were fatal. Civilian casualties in recent years are reported at unprecedented levels since the international intervention began in Afghanistan in 2001.
Many blame internal fractionalization in the government and their inability to reach a compromising unified front as reasons for the state’s failure to provide security. The US Senate Armed Service committee, John Campbell who was then resolute support mission and US Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) reported 70% of problems faced by ANSF were the result of poor leadership. SIGAR outlined the two leading factors to the insecurity was internal contention in the NUG and weak ANSF leadership. The government’s inability to behave as a unified entity to address the concerns of the state is a result of the ambiguous power-sharing document that was brokered by the United States in 2014. The document outlines that all areas of contention were to be cleared by democratically elected district council members and Wolsei Jirga members that will comprise the Loya Jirga, the grand assembly. However, since the 2014 elections, the government has failed to hold district council and parliamentary elections on time, further delaying the deadline for creating the Loya Jirga. Thus, leaving the future of Afghan democracy at a state of uncertainty.
The deeper entrenching issue primarily lays within the distinct visions that are held by both President Ghani and CEO Dr. Abdullah in regards to security. The President has been actively advocating the importance of peace talks with the Taliban, whereas Dr. Abdullah has shared his disproving sentiment towards such measures. Furthermore, the process of selecting ministerial positions is split between the camps and both sides have been accused of ethnic favoritism. This coupled with the lack of consensus between the leaders causes confusion for the operational units in the different factions of ANSF. The lack of clear command from the leaders results in a reactionary approach rather than strategic planning to prevent future attacks. The trickling effect of the NUG’s incompetency becomes a heavy price for civilians and security personnel, due to the approach they are forced to take. Thereby, resulting in inefficiency which cannot be countered by pouring more foreign aid on the problem or risks having the aid further perpetuate insurgency activities.
The growing insecurity, instability, and lack of a strong government has left a vacuum that is being filled by self-interested actors who despite being on government payroll have created a front to counter the NUG. Three Afghan political parties Jamiat-E-Islami, Hiz-e-wahdat-e Islami, and Junibish-e-mili have all agreed to establish the coalition Rescue For Afghanistan. Jamiat-e Islami’s leader Ata Mohammad Noor is the current governor of Balkh and has recently withdrawn his support from CEO Abdullah. The leader of Wahdat Mohammad Mohaqqiq is the second deputy for Chief Executive Abdullah, and leader of Junbish is Abdul Rashid Dostum, the first Vice President to President Ashraf Ghani. Tension between Mr. Dostum and the President heightened when the President requested an investigation be conducted on the claims made by Ahmad Eshchi. Despite these groups announcing their alliance, there has been little evidence to show that they have been working collectively to take any political action in the short-term. However, with the situation worsening in Afghanistan, time will give them greater opportunities to further enhance their power base and increase their leverage when making political demands in the future.
The government needs to reassure its people that security and stability is its main priority, and to do so they will need to solve all internal contention in order to have any hope of countering external factors. The establishment of a Loya Jirga is vital to ensure the long-term stability of democracy in the state, otherwise, other political actors stand to benefit from this period of uncertainty. Insurgency groups, non-state, and state actors are all taking advantage of the NUG’s fractionalization and filling the vacuum to consolidate their own power. These conditions are leaving the people of Afghanistan vulnerable and forcing them to unalign themselves from macro-level objectives and support the faction that provides them the most security locally.

Title: Game of Drones | Khaled Ahmed | New Age Islam | Islamic News and Views | Moderate Muslims & Islam


By Khaled Ahmed
August 5, 2017
Why was Abu Bakar Haqqani found in Hangu
confirming the US charge that Pakistan was sheltering the Haqqani group?
On June 13, a US drone attack in Hangu
district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan killed Abu Bakar Haqqani of
the Afghan terrorist Haqqani Network. Since Abu Bakar Haqqani was killed inside
the area administered by Pakistan and not in the tribal belt, US Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson has threatened an inter-agency review of his country’s
funding and support to Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Pakistan army chief, General
Qamar Javed Bajwa, has objected to the drone strikes inside Pakistani territory
without a warning. Pakistan denies the presence of the Haqqanis after all kinds
of terrorists were supposed to have been driven of the country — including in
the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan — as a result of the Operation
Zarb-e-Azb.
But why was Abu Bakar Haqqani found in
Hangu confirming the US charge that Pakistan was sheltering the Haqqani group?
The Haqqani Network was based in North Waziristan agency and should have had
nothing to do in a Pakistan-administered district. But the truth is that the
Haqqanis have been found in all parts of Pakistan since the founder of the
network, Jalaluddin Haqqani, got his early training in the Quran at Madrasa
Haqqania near Peshawar.
In February 2016, US drones killed five Haqqani
Network terrorists in Hangu taking time off from their depredations in Khost,
Paktika and Logar provinces in Afghanistan in addition to the capital, Kabul.
In 2013, the drones killed a commander of the network again in Hangu after
Pakistan had arrested and released him in 2010 along with other senior members
of the infamous Quetta Shura, which is composed of members of the Afghan
Taliban. Hangu is developing as a rallying point of the network which is
considered the real mover and shaker of the Afghan Taliban — an outfit that
today controls more than half of the Afghan provinces.
Meena Menon — who was reporting from
Islamabad for The Hindu in 2013-14 before she was expelled and is the author of
the excellent book released this year, Reporting Pakistan — notes that after
Nasiruddin Haqqani was killed in 2013 in Islamabad, his funeral was conducted
in Miramshah in North Waziristan by the Taliban. Menon writes, “Nasiruddin
Haqqani, said to be in his thirties, was the eldest son of Jalaluddin. He was
reportedly arrested in 2010 at the behest of the US and was kept in a safe
house for interrogation.
The Pakistani Taliban or TTP had alleged
that security agencies were behind the killing. He was on the UN Security
Council (UNSC) sanctions list of individuals whose assets were frozen and
against whom there was a travel ban and an arms embargo as well. He was also a
fundraiser for the outfit and travelled often to the Middle East.”
Pakistan’s attitude towards the network has
been greatly informed by its relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
which, together with Saudi Arabia, accounts for the bulk of the foreign
remittances from expat Pakistani workers. The Haqqani Network too derives
strong financial support from the UAE. The network’s founder’s family has associations
with that country, which is why the Taliban in Afghanistan issues strong
denials every time the outfit is accused of attacking UAE diplomats in Kabul.
One can understand the Rs 300 million
gifted by Imran Khan to the madrasa near Peshawar where Jalaluddin Haqqani
studied in his youth in light of the fact that many agencies of the tribal area
adjacent to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province don’t starve because of the UAE
remittances. Also, Jalaluddin Haqqani was reared and nurtured by not only Pakistan
but also the Americans and their Arab allies during the anti-Soviet Afghan war.
Jalaluddin Haqqani formed the network in
1995. In 1996, he was appointed minister of tribal affairs, a position he held
till 2001 when the US carpet-bombed the Taliban government out of Kabul.
Pakistan fought the Soviets in Afghanistan
and became part of the international resistance that Washington and Jeddah
generously financed. Not only were the Taliban headed by the Haqqanis, accepted
as friends in need but their Arab ally, the al Qaeda establishment, was
embraced — its founder Abdullah Yusuf Azzam built International Islamic
University of Islamabad with Arab money. The Western world led by the US
encouraged the mingling between the Pakistan state and the Jihadis in Afghanistan,
something very few take note when they quote the US Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen’s statement to the Senate Armed Services
Committee in 2011. “The Haqqani Network acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan’s
Inter-Services Intelligence agency,” Mullen had said.
Pakistan, ever politically unstable, is
being squeezed on the eastern border by India. On the western border, which the
Pakhtun of both states don’t recognise, it is being pressured by the renegade
Pakistani Taliban and the Kabul government, which funds them with financial
assistance from India — all of it getting mixed up with the insurgents in
Balochistan and their killers in Sindh.
The US today threatens to punish Pakistan
if it doesn’t act against the Haqqanis but if Pakistan does its bidding it will
lose its last leverage with Afghanistan which in turn means it will be out of
any peace process with its western neighbour. Regionally, India is getting
together with the US to counter the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) —
Pakistan’s last chance to get out of decades of instability and economic
inertia.

Title: Analysts: Tightening Military Aid to Pakistan Isn’t Enough
Print
The White House’s recent decision to withhold $50 million in military aid to Pakistan for failing to do enough against the Haqqani network has triggered new debate in Pakistan over the country’s war against terrorism and its military’s dependence in recent years on U.S. aid.
Since the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan’s military has received $30 billion in military assistance for helping crack down on groups that target international forces in Afghanistan. But U.S. officials have long complained that Islamabad has fallen short in its fight against the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that many suspect has links to Pakistan’s spy agency. Some analysts say that withholding funds to pressure Islamabad is not effective.
“I think this is not something new. U.S. administrations have been using aid and coalition support funds’ disbursement as leverage against Pakistan for many years now. If this policy did not bring any results in the past, don’t expect any different results this time,” said Jahangir Khattak, a New York-based journalist.
“Despite military aid cuts, Pakistan’s military establishments will not take sincere action against Haqqani network, the one (in which) Pakistan has invested hugely for many years. Although, Pakistan is concerned about Trump’s administration possible unilateral actions, such as stepping up drone attacks and special force operations, as it did on Osama bin Laden,” said Hashim Wahdatyar, an Afghan political expert who is based in Washington, D.C.
​Pakistan says it has paid the price
Pakistan argues that it has paid a steep price in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, carrying out military campaigns in remote tribal areas to push militant groups out of their strongholds. U.S. officials continue to insist that Islamabad’s help is critical for securing peace in Afghanistan.
“Recent experiences indicate that the United States cannot win the war in Afghanistan without Pakistan’s support,” said U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, last month.
Currently, Pakistan is in the middle of military operations on several fronts against the terrorists the most recent one is called Khyber-4, launched against Islamic State.
“Keeping Pakistan’s military engagements in view, the last thing they want to happen is any cuts in assistance. The issue of giving away grants and then taking them away is a bit complicated,” Khadim Hussain, a Peshawar-based political analyst, said. “The authorities in Pakistan might create trouble in the smooth flow of logistics, may start facilitating more violence in Afghanistan, and may also try to sell the Taliban to Russia and China.”
An inconsistent U.S. policy may create a space for Pakistan officials to use all the above options, some analysts say.
More dialogue needed
Journalist Khattak said there is a need for more dialogue to create a better understanding between Pakistan and the United States.
“I think the key to convincing Pakistan to stop its backing of Haqqani network may not come through sanctions,” he said. “The two sides have to take steps to remove the trust deficit that has been bedeviling their relations on quid pro quo basis. Also, key to change in Pakistan’s attitude is its relations with Afghanistan, which are currently passing through a difficult period.”

US National Security Adviser Gen HR McMaster has conveyed President Donald Trump's stern message to Pakistan to change its "paradoxical" policy of supporting the Taliban, Haqqani network and other militants who are causing the country great losses.US officials have often accused Pakistan of helping the militants, a charge Islamabad vehemently denies, but this marks the first time that the allegation has been attributed to President Trump.
"The President has also made clear that we need to see a change in behaviour of those in the region, which includes those who are providing safe haven and support bases for the Taliban, Haqqani Network and others," the Dawn quoted McMaster as saying."This is Pakistan in particular that we want to really see a change in and a reduction of their support for these groups. I mean, this is of course, you know, a very paradoxical situation where Pakistan is taking great losses. They have fought very hard against these groups, but they've done so really only selectively," he added.Defending President Trump's strategy on winning the war in Afghanistan by giving unrestricted powers to the US military based in the war-torn country, McMaster said, "The president has said that he does not want to place restrictions on the military that undermine our ability to win battles in combat.""He has lifted those restrictions, and you're beginning to see the payoff of that as well."In a July 19 meeting at the White House, President Trump berated his generals for not winning the war in Afghanistan and for allowing it to continue for more than 16 years.Trump also "repeatedly suggested" to his senior military advisers that they should replace Gen John Nicholson, the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, with a new general who could win the war.
But McMaster seems to disagree with this suggestion and said "I've known him for many years. I can't imagine a more capable commander on any mission."Although the White House has not announced a comprehensive strategy on Afghanistan yet, McMaster said "the president's already made some important decisions on Afghanistan".
