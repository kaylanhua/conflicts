Anti-government elements, including Taliban and ISKP, were cited as responsible, contributing to the case for heightened U.S. military presence despite troop withdrawal talks.\n\n4. **Urban Attack in Kabul** (July 28, 2019): A separate attack on the office of a political party resulted in 25 deaths, including 15 civilians, and underscored ongoing insecurity in urban centers like Kabul.

The casualties illustrate a tragic backdrop for any potential agreements, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead in the quest for stability.
