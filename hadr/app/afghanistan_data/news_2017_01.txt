Title: Taliban Threatens Trump: Get Out of Afghanistan
A spokesman for the Taliban terrorist group in Afghanistan told President Donald Trump in a recent letter it is time for the United States to withdraw its troops and leave the war-torn country, noting that peace will be elusive.
Under former commander-in-chief Barack Obama, a top spokesman for the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan suggested to Pentagon reporters in October 2016 that the American military and their Afghan counterparts maynever defeat the Taliban, adding that the ultimate goal is a “negotiated solution” and reconciliation between the terrorist group and the Afghan government.
The Taliban hasrepeatedlyclaimed victory over the U.S.-led foreign troops and their Afghan allies.
In the letter to journalists, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warned President Trump that, as long as the U.S.-led coalition remains on Afghan soil, peace will be difficult to attain, reportsthe Associated Press (AP).
“Independence from foreign dominance is ‘the only asset’ an impoverished nation like Afghanistan truly has,” reportedly added the letter.
The Afghan Taliban made a similar demand in a statement issued soon after Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, telling the then-President-elect to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.
Citing the statement,Khaama Press (KP)reported, the “Taliban urged the newly elected [U.S.] President to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan as it claimed victory in the ongoing war in Afghanistan, claiming that the [U.S.] should not further harm its prestige, economy, forces and generals in the country.”
However, it is unlikely President Trump will heed the demand of the Taliban, which capturedmore territoryunder Barack Obama than at any time since its regime was overthrown by the U.S. military in 2001.
TheWall Street Journal (WSJ)learned from unnamed Afghan official earlier this week that then-President-elect Trump told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a phone call in December that he “would certainly continue to support Afghanistan security forces and will consider a proposal for more troops after an assessment.”
According to the Taliban,Russiaalso wants the United States to leave Afghanistan.
“We had a common enemy,” an unnamed senior Taliban official toldReuterslast month. “We needed support to get rid of the United States and its allies in Afghanistan andRussiawanted all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan as quickly as possible.”
While Taliban officials claim Moscow’s support does not extend beyond “moral and political support,” Afghan intelligence and defense officials are reportedly worried “about more direct support including weapons or funding,” noted Reuters.
American Gen. John Nicholson, top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has also expressed dismay towards the “malign influence” in Afghanistan “of external actors” such as “Pakistan, Russia, and Iran.”
In late October 2016, American Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, a top spokesman for the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan, indicated the American-led coalition may never defeat the Taliban when asked, “Do you [think] the United States and the Afghan government will ever defeat the Taliban?”
“The goal for the government of Afghanistan is to ultimately come to a negotiated solution with the Taliban,” he responded. “So, our expectation… is it there is really not a military solution to what is happening here in Afghanistan.”
Gen. Cleveland also described the end game as a “reconciliation” between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
Taliban jihadists have repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops as a condition for peace talks with the United States and the Afghan government.
In December, spokesman Mujahid indicated that the Taliban’s “two conditions for peace talks are the removal of the group leader’s name from the U.N. blacklist and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan,” reportedMilitary.com.
“However, the Afghan government rejected the group’s demands — an indication of the depth of the rift between the two sides in Afghanistan’s protracted conflict,” it added.
In May 2016,Hibatullah Akhundzadabecame the leader of the Taliban following the execution of his predecessor Mullah Akhtar Mansour by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan.

Title: Challenges ahead for Kabul and their repercussions on India
On August 20, 1998, American cruise missiles pounded six sites in Khost in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. There was intelligence information that Osama bin Laden and his supporters were housed in Khost. Osama escaped the raid, but the American missiles destroyed ISI camps of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, being trained for jihad in Kashmir. Taliban rule in Afghanistan enabled the ISI to use Afghan territory for its jihad across India. The Taliban were to prove an asset to the ISI barely a year later, when they colluded with the Pakistani intelligence agency in the hijacking of IC 814 to Kandahar. Even after the Taliban was ousted after 9/11, they have been used by the ISI to target Indian nationals and projects in Afghanistan.
It took the Americans 15 years to acknowledge that despite being designated a “major US non-NATO ally”, Pakistan was providing safe haven to the Taliban, who killed 2,500 American soldiers in Afghanistan. Restrictions and preconditions on the economic and military aid the US was providing to Pakistan were imposed only last year. In the meantime, after receiving massive assistance from Pakistan, the Taliban have emerged as a formidable force across Afghanistan. With only a residual force of 9,800 soldiers in Afghanistan, the US is now concentrating on providing training, intelligence, air power and logistical help to Afghanistan Armed Forces, who have taken around 30,000 casualties in 2016.
India should have no doubt that its security challenges will increase if the Taliban overthrow the present elected government in Afghanistan. For over three years now, Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani have been appealing to Delhi for military aid. After much procrastination, we have provided them with four attack helicopters. Mercifully, the Narendra Modi government appears to be more forthcoming in providing Afghanistan more military assistance. But, for this, we need to make the Chabahar Port fully operational. In a remarkable turnaround in American policy, US Commander in Afghanistan General John Nicholson visited India, seeking our cooperation on this.
Attempts to promote a dialogue between the Taliban and the Afghan government by the US and China drew a blank because of unacceptable preconditions by the Taliban. The Obama administration publicly acknowledged that Pakistan was playing a double game of calling for peace while providing support to the Taliban. President Ghani’s tirade against Pakistan in Amritsar and his decision to boycott the SAARC Summit in Islamabad clearly reflected Afghan anger and frustration at Pakistani duplicity.
China, which predictably backs Pakistan’s desire to give a predominant role for the Taliban in ruling Afghanistan, has been joined by Russia in seeking legitimacy and even tacit recognition of the Taliban for a major role in Afghanistan’s national life. Russia is facing growing problems by the radicalisation of its Muslim Chechen population, who are joining the ISIS, also known as Daesh, for jihad across the Islamic world. Central Asian republics bordering Russia and Afghanistan are witnessing similar developments.  This has led to calls that it is the Daesh and not the Taliban that is the greatest threat to their security. Iran is meanwhile keeping its links with the Taliban open.
The greatest challenge to Indian diplomacy in 2017 lies in persuading Russia, Iran and the Central Asian republics that it would be dangerous to underestimate the threat the Taliban poses to their security. All these countries, like India, are waiting to see how the incoming Donald Trump administration deals with the ISI-backed Taliban challenge in Afghanistan.

Title: Taliban to Trump: It’s time to leave Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan — In a long, rambling letter, the spokesman for the Taliban is telling US President Donald Trump it’s time to leave Afghanistan.
The letter, emailed to journalists Wednesday, was written on behalf of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman, warns Trump that peace will be elusive as long as foreign troops are on Afghan soil.
He adds that independence from foreign dominance is “the only asset” an impoverished nation like Afghanistan truly has.
Written in English, as well as Afghanistan’s two prominent languages, Dari and Pashto, the four-page letter waxed on about Afghanistan’s history, its numerous defeats of invading armies and the reported corruption widespread in Afghanistan today.

Title: Islamic State’s Khorasan Province, 2 Years on – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
Today marks the two-year anniversary of ISIS’s new front in Afghanistan. Can the group consider its venture a success?
Afghan National Army recruits head to the firing line on the small arms range at the Regional Military Training Center.
2014 had been a year of promise for Afghanistan. Peace talks between the Taliban and Pakistan were underway, the U.S.-led coalition ended its official combat mission at the end of the year, and the country had its first ever democratic transfer of power. Although the government-building process was chaotic and protracted, there was a sense of optimism, both at home and within the international community, about the country’s future.
Then, after months of rumors about the group’s emerging presence in Afghanistan, on January 26, 2015, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, Islamic State’s now-deceased spokesperson, announced an “expansion” of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s “caliphate” into the “lands of Khorasan.” A term from Islamic history that encompasses a swathe of South and Central Asia, “Khorasan Province” would come to refer to ISIS operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
2015 stood in contrast to the year that had gone before. Militant violence escalated rapidly; Afghanistan saw more deaths from terrorism in 2015 than ever before in the country, with around 800 more casualties than in the previous year.
Experts debate whether the “ISIS effect” was a symptom or cause of rapidly worsening violence. On one level, ISIS remained a marginal threat, with the Afghan insurgency still Taliban-dominated. The 2015 UN Assistance Mission Report attributed 82 civilian casualties to ISIS-affiliated commanders, but more than 4,000 to the Taliban. However, ISIS’s rise undoubtedly played a role as a catalyst for the commencement of a “race to the bottom” between militants, as the Taliban’s monopoly on anti-state violence diminished. The Taliban perhaps could have refashioned itself as a “moderate” alternative to ISIS brutality. Instead it doubled down, launching renewed attacks under sustained pressure, culminating in the brief capture of the city of Kunduz in September 2015.
The Current Threat
President Ashraf Ghani has said that Afghanistan would be ISIS’s “graveyard,” wishfully adding the group to the lengthy list of failed ventures by outside invaders. But two years on, where does the group stand today? Data from the Center on Religion and Geopolitics’Global Extremism Monitorfor the last quarter of 2016 shows that attacks instigated by ISIS resulted in at least 94 deaths, the great majority of these civilians. But the group also suffered heavy losses — reporting shows that state counteractions killed at least 497 ISIS-affiliated militants during the period.
Operations have been launched against the group by Afghan armed forces, American drones, and Taliban “special operations” units. Yet it remains resilient in its strongholds in Nangarhar Province, in Afghanistan’s east, both because of the favorable geography of the mountainous region, but also the religious landscape, withcontinued supportfor ISIS among some minority Salafi communities in the province.
Under renewed pressure, 2016 saw the group expand its range, as it shifted to insurgency tactics rather than full-fledged militancy. Operations have also been reported around the country, far from the group’s heartlands on the Pakistani border. Anactive cellin Kabul has claimed more than a dozen attacks, while local officials have evenallegedISIS activities as far afield as Ghor province, in the country’s west.
One notable shift that ISIS has brought to the Afghan conflict is an explicit attempt tostoke sectarian conflict, with the aim of pitching itself as the defender of global Sunnism against Shia aggression. This objective has been pursued through its targeting of the Shia-majority Hazara community, in bomb attacks onralliesandreligious ceremonies. So far ISIS’s sectarian approach to this conflict is failing, partly because Hazaras are not responding to ISIS violence in kind, according to Rohullah Yacobi, of the Human Security Center. He expresses concerns, however, that with increasing attacks on the community, anger directed at Kabul for failing to protect minorities is on the rise, and the threat of reciprocal violence is growing, particularly with the likely return of Hazara foreign fighters battling alongside Iranian forces in Syria.
The outsized geopolitical impact of the group’s emergence in Afghanistan cannot be underestimated. Dawood Azami, writing for theBBC, conjures up analogies of a new “great game,” as ISIS’s emergence coincides with a perfect storm of increased tensions between the United States and regional players such as Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan.
ISIS in Afghanistan has few allies, and has managed to present a unifying threat, bringing together unlikely partners and traditional rivals. In particular, the landscape has been changed through increased political engagement by Iran and Russia with the Taliban, over their common ISIS enemy. Russia in particular fears a growing support base for the group in Central Asia, a region firmly within Moscow’s sphere of influence, and which has seen thousands of fighters travel to Iraq and Syria.
A Battle of Ideas
Although ISIS has had limited success in its military efforts and the governing of territory, some experts have suggested that its greater impact, and priority is in the propaganda war for hearts and minds of Afghans. As Borhan Osman, of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, points out, “while ISKP’s influence on the battlefield seems to be waning — at least for now — its ideological potential does not seem to be in a concordant state of decline.”
Osman has conducteddetailed studiesof ISIS’s Afghanistan-focused propaganda. He finds that the quality, variety, and distribution network of ISIS output is outshining that of the Taliban, despite its much smaller size. Four main themes resonate throughout its radio broadcasts and written content: the duty of violent jihad, ISIS’s own legitimacy in fronting this cause, the transnationalism of its movement, and the discrediting of the “deviance” of its jihadi rivals.
Although concluding that ISIS’s ideology has little appeal for most Afghans, Osman identifies potential growth areas for the group, including among educated young people attracted to its apocalyptic vision; would-be jihadis impressed by the “purity” of its mission; and among foreign fighters, particularly those that see the Taliban as nationalistic.
Casey Johnson, an Afghanistan analyst who has researched ISIS in depth, outlined how the group’s “battle of ideas” with the Taliban might play out over the coming year.  ISIS is intent on pushing a religious argument to affirm its legitimacy, and therefore “ownership” of the Afghan jihad, claiming that the Taliban’s IslamicEmirateof Afghanistan is necessarily subservient to ISIS’s caliphate. Johnson notes ISIS’s attempts to “discredit the Taliban on a religious basis in its ‘official’ propaganda outlets like Dabiq, as well as in its radio broadcasts in eastern Afghanistan,” a tactic that has been pursuedsince ISIS’s originationin the country in 2015.
But non-religious arguments are also being made by ISIS propaganda to broaden its appeal across Afghanistan. ISIS portrays the Taliban’s mission as being narrow and nationalistic, and by “emphasizing the Pashtun-centric nature of the Taliban,” the group has worked to appeal to other rival ethnic groups, evidenced through its recruitment of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to its cause.
Perhaps the most important argument being waged for people’s hearts and minds relates to which group — ISIS or the Taliban — is more authentically “Afghan.” The Taliban has been more effective so far in showcasing its credibility, by emphazing the relative foreignness of Baghdadi’s hordes. But this strategy could yet backfire. “By highlighting ISIS’s connections to Pakistan (including leadership, and support zones), a fact that incenses many Afghans, the Taliban risks a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” says Johnson, given the group’s own international support structures from Pakistan and the Gulf.
Implications for the New U.S. Administration
Violent extremism thrives on vacuums, and geopolitical uncertainty. The United States’ new president has cast doubt over the utility of the country’s engagement in Afghanistan, an ambivalence explicitlyseized onby the Taliban. Previously, U.S. strikes have particularly targeted ISIS’s recruitment infrastructure in Afghanistan, including its “Voice of the Caliphate” radio station. The suggestion of premature disengagement seems to stand in contrast to Donald Trump’s idealistic inaugural promise to “wipe out radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth.”
ISIS propaganda has shown remarkable adeptness in shifting its narratives to capitalize on potential advantageous geopolitical developments. While its presence in Afghanistan remains small, the lessons of al-Qaeda’s resilience in the country, despite the presence of an international counter-insurgency operation, must be heeded.  ISIS operations and output in Afghanistan are bolstered by the fact that they are largely unlinked from central command, as its success does not hinge on the fate of the “caliphate”  in Iraq and Syria.
ISIS’s motto is “remaining and expanding.” Two years on, the group can say it has succeeded in achieving one of these aims, against the odds. The international community must stay unwavering in its support for the Afghan state to ensure that the group’s other objective is not accomplished in the coming year.

Title: What to Watch? Key issues to follow in Afghanistan in 2017 - Afghanistan | ReliefWeb
Afghanistan+ 1 more
As in most years, the feeling in January 2017 is that this will be another crucial year for Afghanistan. The AAN team has identified several key themes that we think it important to follow this year. They range from crises in the Afghan government and how changes in global politics, particularly the change of administration in Washington, will affect governance and peace efforts in Afghanistan, to the Afghan government’s efforts in the field of basic rights and freedoms for all and, of course, migration, both Afghans leaving and returning. The list of issues reflects the worry that, in 2017, Afghanistan will be left increasingly alone to sort out its old and new challenges, despite commitments of continued international support.
Key issues to watch in 2017:
Internal crisis in the government
The Afghan government has been in a state of relatively stable crisis. The set-up of the National Unity Government (NUG) and its complex power-sharing arrangements has paralysed governance in Afghanistan and this is likely to continue with several ongoing crises flaring up again in 2017.
2016 saw several attempts to reorganise the power-sharing arrangement, most recently through the removal of ministers by parliament (which has not yet been accepted by the executive); the negotiations between Balkh provincial governor and chairman of Jamiat-e Islami’s Executive Council Atta Muhammad Nur and the President Ashraf Ghani (which has, by design, undermined the position of Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah); the uproar around the alleged attack on former governor of Jowzjan Ahmad Ishchi by, or on the order of, Vice-President Abdul Rashid Dostum; and Hezb-e Islami’s demands for a greater share in power after its September 2016 peace agreement with the government.
For now, there seems to be a lull in the various negotiations, as the various actors wait to see how the United States administration will pan out and what that will mean for their relative positions. The legality of the NUG, which came into being through the mediation of former US Secretary of State John Kerry, was explicitly supported by the previous US administration. A change or a wavering on the US’s side in this regard could signal a reopening of the discussion over the legitimacy of the current government, while changes in the level of financial and/or military support to Afghanistan would affect the strength of the Afghan administration as a whole. Moreover, it is not only the US administration’s formal policies that are relevant. Equally important for the various Afghan powerbrokers, is to see who will have friends and backers in the new administration, and who will not.
Crises and conflicts in the government and the rearranging of relative power risk further escalating ethnic, religious and geographical tensions. These have, in the past year, became particularly visible around the protests over the electricity power line from Central Asia (TUTAP) and the controversy over the reburial of former king, Habibullah Kalakani. Potential future flashpoints include any attempt to sideline Dostum or to share power between three parties in government (by giving a greater share to Hezb-e Islami) or even four (by giving a share to any Taleban splinter faction that might opt for a similar peace deal). Both new parties to the power sharing equation would be overwhelmingly Pashtun.
The rifts, for the moment, are not expected to be bad enough to pull the country or the government apart. Even the Uzbeks, who are currently the most likely to be disaffected, if Dostum is further sidelined, are expected to continue to play a role in the centre as long as they can. Although the mobilising power of the overwhelmingly Hazara-based Enlightenment Movement is regarded with suspicion by the Afghan government (as well as the current Hazara leaders), the movement is not intended to threaten the centre. Having said that, the political rifts need to be taken seriously both by the Afghan and the international side, with all sides guarding against inflaming tensions further. Even if nothing worse happens, getting anything done in government will remain, of course, difficult.
The upcoming elections will continue to dominate the political arena in 2017, even though it is unlikely that the planned parliamentary election will take place in the coming year. The newly appointed Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) will need at least a year to prepare, which can only happen after the possible changes to the electoral system have been agreed and finalised (which may prove to be a further stumbling block). Ultimately, after a long period of the government insisting that the parliamentary elections will take place as soon as is possible, they may actually be further postponed, possibly to be held together with the next presidential election in 2019. In the meantime, the process of political positioning and alliance building, that precedes every presidential election, had already begun in late 2016. This will continue, and increase, throughout 2017 and 2018, probably inspiring new (whether temporary or lasting) partnerships and rifts.
The intensity of the war
The conflict in 2016 continued unabated, showing an increase in Taleban gains, both in territory and influence, particularly in rural areas. The Taleban are likely to seek to intensify their war effort in the coming year and seem to be gearing up to further erode the ANSF’s territorial control and morale by launching intensified and more sophisticated attacks. Alongside the fighting effort, they will probably continue to try and play the ‘soft card’ providing local populations with incentives to surrender and seeking to act as a shadow government in areas under their control or influence – focusing on sectors of the civilian arena such as taxes, security, courts and construction works. Pakistani support to the Taleban’s military effort has continued, despite a series of arrests of key Taleban figures in the autumn. That support is likely to continue in the coming year. However, the forced deportations and departures of large numbers of Afghan refugees from Pakistan may diminish the recruitment pool for the insurgency, at least from Pakistan.
The intensified war effort is likely to lead to further attrition of the Afghan national security forces (ANSF) and losses of territory. The lagging capabilities of the ANSF and the ambiguous role of pro-government ‘auxiliary’ forces (known as ‘National Uprising Groups’) in countering the insurgency, remain points of concern. Although certain units perform well, the ANSF on the whole continue to suffer from attrition, combat readiness, logistics, air power, morale, intelligence capabilities, command and control, lack of coherence and coordination, human rights violations and causing civilian casualties. Not only are the troops on the ground often not able or willing to effectively respond to Taleban attacks, they are also often poorly equipped, left to fend for themselves and faced with an unresponsive, indifferent and sometimes incompetent leadership wracked by political divisions, mistrust and corruption. There have been the first arrests of senior officers accused of fraud or corruption. A deputy to one of the deputy ministers of the interior was found guilty of taking bribes and sent to prison by the newly created Anti-Corruption Criminal Justice Centre.
On both the government and Taleban sides, there were again large numbers of casualties, with little prospect that this will let up. This may have an impact on morale and recruitment on both sides. It could also lead to a further hardening of positions and the entrenching of violence and revenge – or, more hopefully, encourage peace-making.
Whether the ANSF will be able to beat back the Taleban and prevent them from holding on to greater gains, such as key districts, roads or even provincial centres, will largely depend on the extent of sustained international military support. Vulnerable areas in this regard currently include Kunduz, Sar-e pul, Baghlan, Farah and Helmand. The increased recruitment of non-Pashtuns into the Taleban is likely to continue, both in terms of the ground troops and the leadership, providing them with a secure presence in the north.
The US is expected to, in the short run, intensify its military efforts in Afghanistan; General Nicholson, Commander of NATO troops in Afghanistan, as well as the incoming US military and national security team around President Donald Trump seem poised to step up counterterrorism air strikes and focus on killing or capturing the leaders and commanders of the insurgency. This could already be seen in summer 2016 as the US military in Helmand and Kunduz (unsuccessfully) sought to kill the senior most commanders of the Taleban. This is likely to accelerate, if more members of the Taleban leadership move into Afghanistan, as a result of increased pressure by Pakistan.
The intensification of the war has led to much suffering: an increase in civilian casualties, IDPs and food insecurity. This trend is likely to continue. As UNOCHA discussed in its humanitarian appeal for 2017: “The continued deepening and geographic spread of the conflict has prompted a 13% increase in the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2017, now 9.3 million […] With no obvious prospects for an improved state of affairs, 2017 is likely to see at least 450,000 new IDPs and potentially as many as a million more Afghan returns from Pakistan and Iran.”
The Afghan-Pakistani Daesh franchise (known as the Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISKP) will seek to increase its foothold in the east of the country, as well as keep up its media-grabbing presence in the urban centres, particularly Kabul, by committing high-profile terrorist and possibly sectarian attacks. The positioning of regional countries vis-à-vis insurgent and militant groups, including Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China, India and the Gulf states, will continue to affect the relative strengths of the various groups. Changes in patterns of support will obviously have repercussions on the battlefield.
Prospects for peace talks
With the expected military escalation from the US backing up the ANSF and the continued ambiguity within the NUG towards a peace process, prospects for serious peace efforts in 2017 are limited. There has been no sign of any real desire desire to work for a negotiated end to the conflict by the Taleban leadership either. Although there have been a series of informal direct discussions between the Taleban and the NUG in recent months, the effort could easily be (and is to some extent already) offset by a more belligerent US approach. Some semi-governmental and independent initiatives for peace are likely to continue, although probably not in a very consistent or centralised manner. These efforts may or may not gain momentum, depending on the situation on ground and the quality of the initiatives.
The increasing ethnic dynamics of Afghan politics may lead to a re-alignment (or deepening) of positions regarding peace talks. For instance, Kandahar pro-government strongman General Raziq, long known for his robust anti-Taleban stance, particularly on the battlefield, has recently come out with statements honouring the late Taleban leader, Mullah Omar ,and proposing to provide the Taleban with a safe zone – in what was generally read as an ethnically-motivated shift of opinion. There have always been suspicions that both former president Karzai’s and current president Ghani’s support for a peace process (as with the recent Hezb-e Islami deal) were motivated by the wish to strengthen the ‘Pashtun hand’ in politics. This could affect the mood towards a possible peace deal, if at some point there is one on the table.
The extent to which the recent ‘peace agreement’ with Hezb-e Islami has an effect on the battlefield (up till now, wholly absent) and/or results in power sharing and privileges (not yet finalised) may have an effect on support for a possible deal with (parts of) the Taleban. At the moment, the privileges offered by the government seem to far outweigh Hezb’s importance, both in the political and military field. Politically, the peace deal will probably lead to a re-unification of a party that had been split into various wings (several of which were already part of the political set-up in Kabul), allowing Hezb to gain political weight. On the military side, the party’s insurgent wing has not been particularly active for a number of years, but has now promised to send fighters against the Taleban, which may further strengthen the party politically.
The next step in the efforts towards ‘peace’ may be another largely inconsequential deal, this time with the (shrinking) splinter factions of the Taleban, which the government seem to be wooing. These factions may also demand formal representation and a cut of government appointments, as Hezb-e Islami did. All in all, these ‘peace deals’ – both those already concluded and those possibly imminent – are likely to strengthen the influence of a conglomerate of (formerly) armed, Islamist factions in the government (although they could also lead to further competition between them).
Reports that Russia and Iran are in direct talks with (or are supporting) the Taleban continue. Russia was reportedly assured by the Taleban that it was a strictly national movement that did not intend to spread beyond Afghanistan’s borders. Russian support fits in a wider policy of allying itself with local forces against Daesh (and against NATO, which Moscow accuses of supporting Daesh). The recent trilateral talks in Moscow between Russia, Pakistan and China, are being followed with much interest in Afghanistan.

The crisis in the government and the intensification of the conflict may further erode the protection of human rights in Afghanistan – both in the area of civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.
Issues to watch, especially as Afghanistan readies itself for new elections, are efforts by the government to limit freedom of expression, and threats and violence, by various powerful groups and individuals, towards journalists, civil society and non-Islamist political activists. The right to education, especially for girls, in conflict-intense areas remains a concern. The already precarious legal protection for girls and women may face specific challenges, as the ongoing efforts to subsume the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) law into the Penal Code threatens to change or dilute important articles in the EVAW law. In addition, the president may not sign the Law on the Elimination of Harassments against Women and Children, which was recently passed by the Afghan parliament, as Afghanistan’s government tries to combine all separate codes with criminal articles, into a single penal code.
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, which in the past has been an important voice in defence of human rights, will move to its permanent premises in 2017, but the positions of two commissioners remain empty since last year. Decreased international funding of civil society organisations and independent media outlets (the latter already ongoing for years), as well as a decreased focus on democratic and human rights values, threatens to weaken the effectiveness, or even survival, of important independent voices, including in remote areas.
Towards the end of 2016, the NUG established a Judicial Centre for Corruption that has just started operations. There has also been a focus on justice sector reform, led by Vice President Muhammad Sarwar Danesh; the effort, so far, has led to reforms in the penal code and reforms in the judiciary (several rounds of staff replacement). During 2017 it should become clearer whether the claimed campaign against corruption is indeed serious and effective. If it is, there may be political implications, leading to greater factionalism, particularly if the targeting is seen or can be cast as partisan or uneven.
Relations with the US, wider international relations
Changes in US policies on Afghanistan and, more broadly, multilateral cooperation within NATO and the UN, will have a direct effect on the situation in Afghanistan and its region, and on policies in Europe. Changes in US policies on Afghanistan may include an intensification of fighting and targeted killing, in an effort to decisively ‘deal with’ or ‘contain’ the war. It could also result in a decline in funds or a lack of clarity on whether the US will keep its commitments, which will reverberate both in Afghanistan’s national politics and on the battlefield.
Relations with the US may become strained if the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) decides to open an investigation in Afghanistan. A preliminary examination in 2016 showed that the thresholds of admissibility had been reached and that war crimes and crimes against humanity that meet the ICC gravity threshold had been committed in Afghanistan by all parties – the Taleban, US military and CIA, and the NDS and other parts of the ANSF – involved in the armed conflict, after 2003 (the ICC only has jurisdiction of crimes committed from 2003 onwards). The OTP is currently deciding whether to request authorisation from the ICC’s pre-trail chamber to open an investigation.
The Afghan government is ambivalent towards the ICC’s engagement in Afghanistan. President Ghani, although initially supportive of addressing the legacies of war crimes in Afghanistan, has recently said he believes an ICC investigation could undermine peace talks, as it would prevent the Taleban from trusting the government. The fact that the ICC’s preliminary examination names the US as one of the perpetrators, may affect relations between the court and the new US administration.
The economy
The economy is a subject that will be on the mind of many Afghans – both in terms of the sustainability of Afghanistan’s national budget, and the economic opportunities (or lack thereof) for Afghans in general. So far, for the general population, the trends have not been good; poverty and food insecurity rates over the last few years have risen, rather than declined, despite the post-2001 investments.
The government has strongly emphasised the importance of regional cooperation, infrastructure investments and job creation, and has proposed several programs that aim to grow the economy and combat unemployment, although their effects may not be immediately felt.
A key component of the government’s economic policy is driven by the need to increase revenues. This includes expanding tax collection, levying new taxes and computerising the customs system to cut down corruption and other losses. Donors, in particular, expect Afghanistan’s revenue generation to steadily grow, as a reassurance that at some point in the future the country will be able to fend for itself without massive international assistance. Experts however have noted that the recent increases in revenue collection are either not replicable or unsustainable and that the economy is set to shrink rather than grow.
For the second year in a row, the number of provinces declared ‘poppy-free’ has decreased; in 2016, 21 provinces were cultivating opium, with only 13 declared poppy-free (UNODC considers a province ‘poppy-free’ if less than 100 hectares is under cultivation). Issues to watch include the drug economy; whether changes in domestic and regional relations lead to a restructuring of who controls the trade; and the festering water management conflicts with the neighbours.
Migration: leaving and returning
2015 and the beginning of 2016 saw unprecedented, at least in recent years, numbers of Afghans leaving their country and traveling towards Europe. This was fuelled by the declining hope of a politically and economically stable Afghanistan and the pull of the, temporarily, open route provided by the Balkans corridor (for about half a year, all Afghans who reached the western Balkans were ferried onwards into the EU). The fear of a sustained high influx prompted European countries to tighten their procedures and border controls. As a result, the numbers of Afghans travelling to Europe seem to have returned to pre-2015 levels.
Mass returns of refugees from Pakistan and Iran since, which are expected to continue in 2017 (more than half a million from Pakistan alone since July 2016), have been a heavy burden on the country’s economy and have overburdened already fragile services, particularly health and education, in the most-affected areas. This is exacerbated by the fact that many returnees have not lived in Afghanistan for a long time (or, in many cases, ever). The large numbers of returnees from Pakistan and Iran, and to a lesser extent from Europe, moreover, are likely to result in a serious decline of remittances, both at the national and the household level.
European countries seem poised to continue to view migration as a key issues in their bilateral relations with the Afghan government, with a particular focus on ensuring Afghan cooperation with forcible returns – a politically unpopular position for the government to be in. The miserable conditions in and on the road to Europe, however, mean that far fewer Afghans are currently contemplating the trip. This is what Europe intended, but the diminishing opportunities for young people means that the country has lost an important pressure valve.

Title: Islamic State’s Khorasan Province, 2 Years on – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
Today marks the two-year anniversary of ISIS’s new front in Afghanistan. Can the group consider its venture a success?
Afghan National Army recruits head to the firing line on the small arms range at the Regional Military Training Center.
2014 had been a year of promise for Afghanistan. Peace talks between the Taliban and Pakistan were underway, the U.S.-led coalition ended its official combat mission at the end of the year, and the country had its first ever democratic transfer of power. Although the government-building process was chaotic and protracted, there was a sense of optimism, both at home and within the international community, about the country’s future.
Then, after months of rumors about the group’s emerging presence in Afghanistan, on January 26, 2015, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, Islamic State’s now-deceased spokesperson, announced an “expansion” of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s “caliphate” into the “lands of Khorasan.” A term from Islamic history that encompasses a swathe of South and Central Asia, “Khorasan Province” would come to refer to ISIS operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
2015 stood in contrast to the year that had gone before. Militant violence escalated rapidly; Afghanistan saw more deaths from terrorism in 2015 than ever before in the country, with around 800 more casualties than in the previous year.
Experts debate whether the “ISIS effect” was a symptom or cause of rapidly worsening violence. On one level, ISIS remained a marginal threat, with the Afghan insurgency still Taliban-dominated. The 2015 UN Assistance Mission Report attributed 82 civilian casualties to ISIS-affiliated commanders, but more than 4,000 to the Taliban. However, ISIS’s rise undoubtedly played a role as a catalyst for the commencement of a “race to the bottom” between militants, as the Taliban’s monopoly on anti-state violence diminished. The Taliban perhaps could have refashioned itself as a “moderate” alternative to ISIS brutality. Instead it doubled down, launching renewed attacks under sustained pressure, culminating in the brief capture of the city of Kunduz in September 2015.
The Current Threat
President Ashraf Ghani has said that Afghanistan would be ISIS’s “graveyard,” wishfully adding the group to the lengthy list of failed ventures by outside invaders. But two years on, where does the group stand today? Data from the Center on Religion and Geopolitics’Global Extremism Monitorfor the last quarter of 2016 shows that attacks instigated by ISIS resulted in at least 94 deaths, the great majority of these civilians. But the group also suffered heavy losses — reporting shows that state counteractions killed at least 497 ISIS-affiliated militants during the period.
Operations have been launched against the group by Afghan armed forces, American drones, and Taliban “special operations” units. Yet it remains resilient in its strongholds in Nangarhar Province, in Afghanistan’s east, both because of the favorable geography of the mountainous region, but also the religious landscape, withcontinued supportfor ISIS among some minority Salafi communities in the province.
Under renewed pressure, 2016 saw the group expand its range, as it shifted to insurgency tactics rather than full-fledged militancy. Operations have also been reported around the country, far from the group’s heartlands on the Pakistani border. Anactive cellin Kabul has claimed more than a dozen attacks, while local officials have evenallegedISIS activities as far afield as Ghor province, in the country’s west.
One notable shift that ISIS has brought to the Afghan conflict is an explicit attempt tostoke sectarian conflict, with the aim of pitching itself as the defender of global Sunnism against Shia aggression. This objective has been pursued through its targeting of the Shia-majority Hazara community, in bomb attacks onralliesandreligious ceremonies. So far ISIS’s sectarian approach to this conflict is failing, partly because Hazaras are not responding to ISIS violence in kind, according to Rohullah Yacobi, of the Human Security Center. He expresses concerns, however, that with increasing attacks on the community, anger directed at Kabul for failing to protect minorities is on the rise, and the threat of reciprocal violence is growing, particularly with the likely return of Hazara foreign fighters battling alongside Iranian forces in Syria.
The outsized geopolitical impact of the group’s emergence in Afghanistan cannot be underestimated. Dawood Azami, writing for theBBC, conjures up analogies of a new “great game,” as ISIS’s emergence coincides with a perfect storm of increased tensions between the United States and regional players such as Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan.
ISIS in Afghanistan has few allies, and has managed to present a unifying threat, bringing together unlikely partners and traditional rivals. In particular, the landscape has been changed through increased political engagement by Iran and Russia with the Taliban, over their common ISIS enemy. Russia in particular fears a growing support base for the group in Central Asia, a region firmly within Moscow’s sphere of influence, and which has seen thousands of fighters travel to Iraq and Syria.
A Battle of Ideas
Although ISIS has had limited success in its military efforts and the governing of territory, some experts have suggested that its greater impact, and priority is in the propaganda war for hearts and minds of Afghans. As Borhan Osman, of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, points out, “while ISKP’s influence on the battlefield seems to be waning — at least for now — its ideological potential does not seem to be in a concordant state of decline.”
Osman has conducteddetailed studiesof ISIS’s Afghanistan-focused propaganda. He finds that the quality, variety, and distribution network of ISIS output is outshining that of the Taliban, despite its much smaller size. Four main themes resonate throughout its radio broadcasts and written content: the duty of violent jihad, ISIS’s own legitimacy in fronting this cause, the transnationalism of its movement, and the discrediting of the “deviance” of its jihadi rivals.
Although concluding that ISIS’s ideology has little appeal for most Afghans, Osman identifies potential growth areas for the group, including among educated young people attracted to its apocalyptic vision; would-be jihadis impressed by the “purity” of its mission; and among foreign fighters, particularly those that see the Taliban as nationalistic.
Casey Johnson, an Afghanistan analyst who has researched ISIS in depth, outlined how the group’s “battle of ideas” with the Taliban might play out over the coming year.  ISIS is intent on pushing a religious argument to affirm its legitimacy, and therefore “ownership” of the Afghan jihad, claiming that the Taliban’s IslamicEmirateof Afghanistan is necessarily subservient to ISIS’s caliphate. Johnson notes ISIS’s attempts to “discredit the Taliban on a religious basis in its ‘official’ propaganda outlets like Dabiq, as well as in its radio broadcasts in eastern Afghanistan,” a tactic that has been pursuedsince ISIS’s originationin the country in 2015.
But non-religious arguments are also being made by ISIS propaganda to broaden its appeal across Afghanistan. ISIS portrays the Taliban’s mission as being narrow and nationalistic, and by “emphasizing the Pashtun-centric nature of the Taliban,” the group has worked to appeal to other rival ethnic groups, evidenced through its recruitment of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to its cause.
Perhaps the most important argument being waged for people’s hearts and minds relates to which group — ISIS or the Taliban — is more authentically “Afghan.” The Taliban has been more effective so far in showcasing its credibility, by emphazing the relative foreignness of Baghdadi’s hordes. But this strategy could yet backfire. “By highlighting ISIS’s connections to Pakistan (including leadership, and support zones), a fact that incenses many Afghans, the Taliban risks a case of the pot calling the kettle black,” says Johnson, given the group’s own international support structures from Pakistan and the Gulf.
Implications for the New U.S. Administration
Violent extremism thrives on vacuums, and geopolitical uncertainty. The United States’ new president has cast doubt over the utility of the country’s engagement in Afghanistan, an ambivalence explicitlyseized onby the Taliban. Previously, U.S. strikes have particularly targeted ISIS’s recruitment infrastructure in Afghanistan, including its “Voice of the Caliphate” radio station. The suggestion of premature disengagement seems to stand in contrast to Donald Trump’s idealistic inaugural promise to “wipe out radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth.”
ISIS propaganda has shown remarkable adeptness in shifting its narratives to capitalize on potential advantageous geopolitical developments. While its presence in Afghanistan remains small, the lessons of al-Qaeda’s resilience in the country, despite the presence of an international counter-insurgency operation, must be heeded.  ISIS operations and output in Afghanistan are bolstered by the fact that they are largely unlinked from central command, as its success does not hinge on the fate of the “caliphate”  in Iraq and Syria.
ISIS’s motto is “remaining and expanding.” Two years on, the group can say it has succeeded in achieving one of these aims, against the odds. The international community must stay unwavering in its support for the Afghan state to ensure that the group’s other objective is not accomplished in the coming year.

Title: Security Sector Reform: Long Overdue in Afghanistan – The Diplomat
ReadThe Diplomat,Know The Asia-Pacific
Afghanistan’s failure to bring reform to its security apparatus is long overdue for a fix.
Afghanistan started 2017 with a blood bath.
More than 38 people werekilledin twin bombings in Kabul. Another blast in Kandahar claimed at least seven lives and injured over a dozen, including the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador, who was visiting the city to inaugurate multiple projects.
Afghanistan’s failure to bring reform to its security apparatus has been central to the continuation of unabated and enduring violence in the country. In 2016 alone, Afghan security forceslostmore than 15,000 personnel in battle and more than 1,600 Afghan civilians werekilled.
At the leadership positions from the beginning of the new government, commanders have often integrated their ethnic militias into the Afghan National Army (ANA), Afghan National Police (ANP), and National Directorate of Security (NDS). An overwhelming number of ANA and ANP officers are ethnic Tajik former Jamiat-e-Islami militias and represented disproportionately.
Even though there is a policy in place to represent all ethnicities proportionately, the criteria is fulfilled by the rank and file. Men lacking even high school degrees rose to the highest military ranks overnight. Afghanistan todayhasnearly 1,000 generals, more than the U.S. active duty military — the strongest military in the world. A staggering number of those generals have acquired these ranks through ethnic or family patronage. Each one of these generals has dozens of bodyguards and great compensation and logistical needs, sucking a great sum of resources from the national budget.
Since its invasion in 2001, the United States alone has spent more than $64 billion in building up Afghanistan, including its police and military. Yet all of that has not bought the Afghans sustainable security institutions. The Afghan Air Force still runs on a few dysfunctional helicopters. Afghan security forces are struggling on, all owing to a lack of good leadership, coordination, and widespread corruption.
Leaders of the security forces, former Northern Alliance militia, have never received proper military training. They have terribly mismanaged the 350,000 standing Afghan forces, which has resulted in immense casualties to the rank and file over the past decade.
In January 2016, Jabar Qahraman, a former army general and current MP,was assignedas a special operative to Helmand by President Ashraf Ghani to prevent the Taliban’s advancement in the province. After spending seven months there, Qahraman diagnosed severe maladies within the security forces.
He reported the issues to the president, but no action was taken due to warlords’ influence within the ANSF. In an interview, hebrought forthissues that seem possible to tackle with the current leadership.
According to him, a lack of coordination among security institutions, a waste of military resources, ghost soldiers, corrupt and incapable leadership, and a highly centralized chain of command have failed 33,000 organized troops against roughly around 200 militant fighters in Helmand. This is not just Helmand — the same applies to all other corps.
Furthermore, the ANSF have failed to foil the use of basic warfare tactics by Taliban. For example, Taliban usually detonate one bomb and successively another one once people, especially security forces, converge to the location of the first incident — causing countless casualties. This happened in Kabul’s recent bombing and on numerous other occasions.
Another example is police and army recruits buses are attacked frequently; these incidents could easily be avoided.
The Kandahar attack, which killed several officials and foreign dignitaries, targeted the governor’s guesthouse. The entire Kandahar police force failed to secure a high-level diplomatic delegation.
The ANSF is in need of reform at all levels immediately.
First and foremost, ethnic militias should be eradicated from the ANSF. They function as a roadblock to any reform.
Second, officers who are recently trained in and out of Afghanistan and have no political affiliation should get elevated to leadership positions.
Third, a sophisticated strategy of coordination between security institutions should be developed.
Fourth, a rigorous criteria should be put in place for promotions.
Fifth, a joint squad should be formed to address warlords’ infractions in provinces.
Finally, the lack of an effective rotation policy and a defensive approach in the line of fire of the Taliban within ANSF has put immense strain on the rank and file. Those need to be addressed.
There is no lack of bravery in the rank and file in Afghanistan, but that fighting spirit is weakened by corrupt leadership. Commanders sell fuel and arms to Taliban, and pocket the salaries of ghost soldiers — tens of thousands of them.
Since the Taliban look nowhere near close to cutting a peace deal, President Ashraf Ghani needs to design a security sector reform strategy and bring about radical changes in ANSF. The government cannot buy its people’s loyalty and neither can it win the war with the current state of Afghanistan’s security forces.

Afghanistan
Recent developments herald a troubled year for the Afghans
Mona Kanwal Sheikh
During 2015 and 2016, the Taliban have been on an offensive and gained territory. Particularly they have made inroads into strategic areaswhere the Taliban can control the roads. At the same time, there is an active fight between the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and Taliban over 20% of the Afghan territory. How the final battle will fall out is unknown, but if the ANSF loses, the Taliban can end up controlling up to one-third of the country.
The past couple of years have seen an increase in violent incidents, an increase in militant actors and in both the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) andAfghan returnees from the EU, Pakistan and Iran. The increase of violence is related both to the force used by insurgents and the Afghan government. The increase in militant actors is due to the military operation, known as the Zarb-e-Azb, launched by the Pakistani army in the tribal areas of Pakistan, which has pushed over new militants to Afghan soil, but also due to theentrance of the Islamic State into Afghanistan.
In the face of this situation, analysts and observers who monitor Afghanistan closely have identified troublesome challenges in the Afghan security sector. These are primarily issues of loyalty and high desertion rates within the ANSF, but also the high level of corruption that still haunts all sectors of government in Afghanistan. Additional challenges are the lack of full control over government militias and the human rights violations that follow the government’s use of local militias. Adding to this, there is a lack of intelligence capabilities and gathering, which is one of reasons why the Taliban have been on an offensive during the past couple of years.
Insurgency in advance
The NATO forces concluded the “International Security Assistance Force” (ISAF) mission by the end of 2014. A new NATO-led mission, “Resolute Support,” commenced on January 1, 2015 with a mandate to solely train, advice, and assist the ANSF. However, during the first part of 2015, Afghanistan also saw an increase in insurgency operations that led to theTaliban take-over of territory. The Taliban have made offensives in Kandahar, Uruzgan, in a number of strategic areas in the northern province of Baghlan over the past two years and in Helmand, where large areas are under their control. In areas like Zabul and Uruzgan, the Taliban also took control over roads.The Taliban have also made inroads to part of the Ring Road, which links Kabul to the north.
The Taliban managed to take temporarily control over the city of Kunduz in September 2015 – an event that shook the international community working towards a complete security transition, i.e. letting the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) be responsible for the security of Afghanistan. The ambition was that this should have happened by the end of 2016.
Increase in violence, militant actors and displacement
In response to the insurgency in advance, the ANSF have conducted several military operations, beginning in late 2015 and continuing throughout 2016. Among the consequences of the increased military activities are the displacement of hundreds of families and the erosion of local communities’ trust in the government. The Taliban are allegedly also undertaking relief work among the internally displaced people (IDPs), which adds to their mobilisation capacity.
The Haqqani Network, which maintains distinct command and particular lines of operations work more closely with the Taliban, and have caused some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan (UNAMA, February 2016). The number of civilians killed during government military operations also increased during 2015 (Human Rights Watch, Jan 2016). It is worth noting that the schools that are hijacked for military use are both hijacked by insurgents and by pro-government militias.
There has also been a spill-over of militants from the Pakistan army's operation Zarb-e-Azb, launched in the North Waziristan tribal area of Pakistan (these include Uzbek, Arab and Pakistani militants). Adding to this, the Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) announced its presence in Afghanistan in January 2015. ISK is mainly present in southern Nangarhar. Reports indicate that they constitute between 1500-3000 fighters. Islamic State militants collaborate with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and elements of the Pakistani Taliban, but are at war with the Afghan Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants. Primarily however, they are fighting the Afghan state, attacking both civilians and the ANSF.
While Europe has been focusing on the asylum seekers to Europe (in 2015, 180,000 Afghans applied for asylum in Europe), there is almost 1 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan (Human Rights Watch 2016). Adding to this, more than 300,000 Afghan refugees have been repatriated from Pakistan since July 2016. In addition, Iran has been deporting Afghan refugees. Human Rights Watch has reported that Iran has been recruiting thousands of Afghan refugees to fight in pro-government armed groups in neighbouring Syria. Those who have been deported to Afghanistan as a punishment allegedly refused the coerced fighting. The implications of this is, that Afghanistan is probably facing a humanitarian crisis that we can’t yet imagine. In spite of the increase in violence, and violent actors during the past two years, the EU does not consider Afghanistan to be a war zone.
New advancement in peace initiatives
In spite of the obvious challenges, there are minor signs of progress when it comes to the track that is about advancing dialogue between the different stakeholders of the conflict. In September 2016, a peace deal was signed between Gulbuddin Hekmatyar from Hezb-e Islami and President Ashraf Ghani. This was portrayed as the first major peace achievement of the last fifteen years. However, Hezb-e Islami has not been actively fighting on the battlefield for years, andit can be questioned whether the Taliban will follow the example, considering the different aims of the two groups, and their history as enemies.
In July 2015, the first direct, and publicly known, meeting between the High Peace Council of Afghanistan and the Taliban was hosted by Pakistan. This meeting was a more significant development since it brought together the two conflicting parties, though with no immediate results. Peace initiatives are nothing new in the Afghan context: Afghanistan already started its reach-out activities in 2005 and launched the peace initiative, the Program Takhim-E-Sohl (PTS). PTS failed, partly due to inadequate funding and the lack of domestic Afghan political support. In 2010, Afghanistan’s High Peace Council was formed, among other things to initiate peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. In September 2011, however, the head of the program, Burhanuddin Rabbani, an old rival of the Taliban, was assassinated and the faith in the process decreased. The 2015 meeting is an initial step towards restarting the trust-building measures.
One of the main questions in an environment where the Taliban and other militant actors in Afghanistan show no signs of weakness, and where we do not know whether Islamic State militants will gain more influence, is how peace talks can succeed. The exact composition of the peace councils, and exactly who has participated in the previous negotiations and peace talks, has proved to be vital for the way the Taliban have viewed the talks and their willingness to participate. Persons that have long relations of enmity with the Taliban, for instance, should not lead a reconciliation process. In addition, there has been confusion about who the main parts in the peace talks should be. The international community could do more to facilitate the peace and reconciliation processes. More than 15 years of fighting have not been able to eradicate the insurgent groups, and more could be done by intensifying the focus on conflict resolution.
Challenges in the Afghan security sector
Though it is not an easy task to build up an army from the ground, one of the challenges that have been pointed out by looking back at the past couple of years is that there is still a divided loyalty among the Afghan security forces. For instance, the way that the Taliban could take over Kunduz revealed that some of the units did not resist. At the same time, strong ethnic and tribal loyalties constitute a continuous challenge for the way the civil population perceive the security forces and its uneven composition of the different tribes. There are also high desertion rates and inactive soldiers in the Afghan National Army that are sometimes termed ‘ghost soldiers’ – persons on the payroll but not on the battlefield, which has been pointed out to be a challenge in e.g. Helmand.
The above problems of loyalty are linked to a high level of corruption. The ‘loyalty for sale’ issue is a challenge not only for the Afghan National Army (ANA), but also for the Afghan Local Police, (a local defence force against Taliban insurgents with no arresting or investigative functions, but part of the Ministry of Interior, established in 2010). This is supposedly also due to thelower level of salary as compared to the National Police Force. The fact that the Afghan government is increasingly using militiamen to assist the Afghan Local Police also points to the danger of not being able to control forces that are on the government payroll.
An issue that relates to the lack of control, and that the international community needs to be aware of, is that the Afghan Local Police and pro-government militias continue to recruit children (Human Rights Watch 2016). Together with corruption, the violation of human rights are some of the fundamental issues that call for the international community to do more to assure the rightful application of aid-money and to prevent it from becoming linked to both human rights violations and corruption.
One of the reasons that observers point at in order to explain the increasingly defensive role of the ANSF (and similarly the more offensive posture of the Taliban and the Haqqani network) is the poor state of intelligence gathering. The knowledge about Taliban strongholds and movements has declined due to the lack of certain capabilities and equipment. When NATO’s ISAF mission was active, the intelligence gathering was happening at another level, while the ANSF lacks both surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities (AREU, 2016).
The challenges within the Afghan security sector are linked to, and reflect, the challenges that are also inherent in other sectors of government: the tensions in the unity government between the two old rivals (President Ashraf Ghani and chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah) make decision-making challenging. At the same time, there is still significant progress to be made when it comes to electoral reforms, empowerment of women, combating corruption, countering narcotics trafficking, ensuring a stable security environment, jobs creation and improving economic opportunities. Addressing the challenges within the security sector would require addressing these enduring challenges.
The new NATO mission
The shift from nation-building to capacity-building that took place in 2009 with president Obama was presumably based on the realisation that nation-building would require means that were larger than the will of the Americans. Reflecting this change, the new NATO mission, namely the ‘Resolute Support’ mission, that replaced the ISAF mission, has capacity-building at its core. However, the Taliban take-over of Kunduz, one of the largest cities of Afghanistan, though temporarily, pointed out the fact that there is still a long way before the ANSF will be able to operate without the support of international forces. When the Taliban took over Kunduz, it put two districts under sustained attacks, and reports say that no reinforcements or logistical support arrived when the second district (the Dasht-i-Archi district) came under attack.
The weakness of the ANSF raises the question of whether the status of Afghan nationhood will continuously be challenged by the strong ethnic and tribal identities. Ultimately, this is a more fundamental question of whether the national army, and thereby the focus of the NATO mission, will always face these structural constrains.
The Resolute Support mission would need to address how to handle the challenges identified above (desertion/divided loyalties, corruption, institutional/systemic deficiencies). Particularly the high level of corruption puts the NATO mission in a Catch-22. Afghanistan’s defence and security sector is ranked in the highest risk categories for corruption according to Transparency International’s Defence and Security Program in its 2015 Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index (Transparency International 2015). Some of the causes of this are patronage and nepotism, low pay, and ethnic favouritism.
Re-activating US combat force
The US still has around 9,800 troops present in Afghanistan. In mid-2016, US president Obama announced that he hoped to reduce the number of troops to 5,500 by early 2017 and wanted to cut down the number to 8,400 in 2016 – this, however, never happened. In June 2016, President Obama instead approved a policy to give the US military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces to fight the Taliban. This policy allows the US to fight the Taliban directly and more flexibility to carry out airstrikes or wage ground combat. NATO members and other partners, although with a different mandate, have contributed 6,000 troops.
The US troops could stay due to the bilateral security agreement that president Ghani signed shortly after he took office. However, it is unclear what role the increased American use of air force and counterterrorism operations will play when it comes to the recruitment abilities of insurgent groups. The danger is that it will again lead to an escalation of the conflict and create further pressure on the ANSF. US involvement is an issue that divides Afghan society, but so far, one of the main grievances of the Taliban is that they will continue fighting as long as the US forces are present in Afghanistan.
The fact is that the war is ongoing in Afghanistan, including the western involvement. The Taliban appear strong, and now Islamic State is adding to the complexity (together with Al-Qaeda, who by the way, are still there). How the war in Afghanistan will evolve depends a great deal on how the Trump administration chooses to deal with Afghanistan in 2017.

Title: Wife of U.S. author missing in Afghanistan makes appeal
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The wife of an American author who disappeared on a research trip in Afghanistan more than two years ago appealed for his freedom on Thursday in a Pakistani newspaper. Paul Overby, 74, went missing in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province shortly after May 17, 2014, the last contact he had with his family. He was hoping to interview Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the Taliban-allied Haqqani militant network, and was trying to cross from Afghanistan into Pakistan's volatile North Waziristan region, according to the Pakistani daily the News. His wife, Jane Larson, told the newspaper she believed her husband was kidnapped and she appealed to his captors "to return him as soon as possible and show the mercy of Allah to unite an aging couple who have been apart too long". Sources in the Taliban and the Haqqani network, however, told the News they were not holding Overby and it was unclear what happened to him. Overby is the author of 1993's "Holy Blood: An Inside View of the Afghan War", based on his research and travels in Afghanistan during a U.S.-sponsored "mujahadeen" insurgency against a Soviet-backed government. Last month, the Taliban released a Haqqani network video of American Caitlan Coleman and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, who were abducted in 2012 while on a backpacking trip. The video also showed two sons born to the couple while in captivity. (Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Robert Birsel)
