Specific incidents in Badakhshan, Baghlan, and Takhar provinces resulted in significant humanitarian needs for those affected.\n\n5. **Ghazni Province**: Airstrikes conducted by Afghan forces were met with backlash from local residents, notably after reports emerged that several civilians were killed during operations targeting insurgents. Protests erupted following an airstrike on September 28, which was claimed to have resulted in civilian casualties.\n\n6. **Attacks on Election Day**: On September 28, 2019, during Afghanistan's presidential elections, multiple incidences of violence were reported, with at least 19 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) detonated across the country, causing injuries and further straining the humanitarian situation.\n\n7. **Uruzgan and Zabul Provinces**: In Uruzgan, military operations caused the displacement of 1,610 people, alongside notable civilian casualties due to armed conflict. In Zabul, two children and one woman were reported killed from rocket fire, showcasing the severe impact on civilian lives.\n\n8. **Kunduz Province**: In late September 2019, violent clashes resulted in further displacements and enhanced humanitarian crises, with explicit calls for aid due to deteriorating security conditions following heavy military operations.\n\nIn summary, the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, driven by the actions of the Taliban, ISIS, and various military operations, has resulted in severe humanitarian crises marked by civilian casualties and displacement. These incidents reflect a complex socio-political landscape as peace efforts continue to falter amidst escalating violence."}
