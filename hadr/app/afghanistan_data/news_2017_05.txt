Title: Iran’s Taliban Gamble in Afghanistan | Middle East Institute








Joshua Levkowitz
Accusations are mounting that Iran is ramping up its engagement with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Like a lot of Iran’s murky foreign policy, it is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. The three questions that need to be answered to clear up the murky relationship between Iran and the Taliban are: why the change in Iran’s policy; when did this policy change occur; and what is the level of support afforded to the Taliban?
Unlikeliest of Allies
The Taliban’s Sunni-first ideology, its history of persecuting Afghan Shiites, and its attacks on Iranians make the group the unlikeliest of allies for Iran.
In the late 1990s, the Taliban’s deliberate anti-Shiite program provoked a near-all-out war with Iran. During the Afghan civil war, the Taliban aimed to cleanse northern Afghanistan of Afghan, Shiite Hazaras. In the wake of the Taliban’s advance, thousands of Shiite Hazaras were massacred. In 1998, a small Taliban unit entered the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif, Afghanistan’s third largest city, and rounded up and executednine Iranian diplomats.Taliban units then moved to take over Bamiyan in central Afghanistan, the core of the Hazara ethnic group, and continued their massacre. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Pakistan of backing the Taliban in capturing Bamiyan, and a force of 70,000 composed of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Iranian military forces, mobilized along the Iran-Afghanistan border.
Iran became the main foreign backer of the Northern Alliance, the Taliban’s main domestic rival, and then tacitly cooperated with the United States in overthrowing the Taliban in 2001. Although Iran originally viewed the Taliban as an ideological threat, geopolitical dynamics post-9/11 changed Tehran’s original calculation.
Common Enemies
Iran has ramped up its support due to recent events in Afghanistan, namely Washington’s erratic policy switch—from Obama’s scheduled drawdown in 2014 to the now seemingly done deal involving increased U.S. support, as evidenced by the recent dropping of the “mother-of-all-bombs.” The Trump administration’s u-turn has created the uncertainty in Afghanistan. This uncertainty may have played a role in influencing Iran to hedge its bets vis-à-vis Afghan actors, in particular the Taliban.
With the cooling period in U.S.-Iranian relations, after the new U.S. administration entered office, Iran’s leaders are concerned once again about the United States using Afghanistan as a base from which to launch a potential attack on their country. Thus in the short term, at least, the Taliban is furthering Iranian interests via its insurgency against the U.S.-backed government.
The rise of ISIS in the eastern part of the country is also of great concern to Iran. ISIS, which wields the most acute hostility toward Shiites, has recruited fighters to Iran’s west in Iraq and to its east in Afghanistan. Unlike the Taliban, ISIS ideology is transnational and can be used to stir up Iran’s restive Sunni populations. Yet, also unlike the native Taliban, the transnational terrorist group depends upon a nexus of recruiting, coopting, and coercing local groups in Afghanistan. The Taliban has grown to become one of ISIS’ primary enemies in Afghanistan, as ISIS competes with the Taliban, and aims to peel away disaffected fighters from Taliban ranks. Taliban and ISIS fighters regularly clash; in early May,more than two dozen fighterswere left dead after an encounter in eastern Nangarhar province.
By providing limited support to the Taliban, Iran is hitting two birds with one stone: creating a buffer against ISIS and preventing the United States from using Afghanistan as a base against Iran.
The Crucial Year
2014 represents the critical juncture in Iran’s shift with the Taliban. In this year, the vast majority of international combat troops withdrew from Afghanistan, a major blow to the credibility of the Afghan government. Iran moved to formalize its relationship with the Taliban by allowing it open a foreign office in Mashhad, diversifying the pariah group’s international presence. The Islamic State also gained strength in Nangarhar province, starting in the middle of that year after several regional groups, including Al Tawhid Brigade and Ansar ul-Khilafat Wal-Jihad,pledged formal allegianceto ISIS. These events pushed Iran and the Taliban closer together.
In the spring of 2015, Taliban members from their political bureau in Qatar, led by Mohammad Tayyab Agha, travelled to Iran to discuss Afghan and regional affairs. And last May, Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Afghanistan from Iran where he been staying.
Just Enough Support
The Iranians have mainly worked with Taliban factions based in Afghanistan’s three western provinces that border Iran. In January, officials from Afghanistan’s western Farah province, which borders Iran, claimed that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have been arming and training the Taliban. Farah Provincial Council Chair Jamile Amini accused Iran of sending fighters to join the Taliban.The Wall Street Journalreported in 2015that Iran sent weapons to the Taliban, including “82mm mortars, light machine guns, AK-47 rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and materials for making roadside bombs.”
This past December, the Afghan Senate opened an investigation into Iran’s military ties with the Taliban. Iran has also been accused of harboring Taliban leaders. Lawmaker Jumadin Gayanwal from Paktika provincetoldVOA, “Iran not only has hosted Taliban families, it has supplied the group with weapons that could target and damage tanks and planes.”
Media accounts, such as thisone, have fixated on the increasing levels of support afforded to the Taliban, but as of now, it still seems that Iran primarily perceives the Taliban as a useful enemy-of-an-enemy against both U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan and the Islamic State. Iran will continue its marriage of convenience through providing just enough arms and training to the Taliban, which is different from a full-blown investment to change the equation in Afghanistan.
Iran recognizes that the group will eventually play some role in the Afghan government, so there is a benefit to a limited relationship for influence down the road. However, if either the United States or the Islamic State move to drastically alter dynamics in the country, Iranian leaders might, once again, have to recalculate their Taliban connection.

Rich Edson reports from the State Department
KABUL, Afghanistan –Afghanistan villagers caught in Taliban territory in the northern province of Kunduz, by the border of Tajikistan, recently began reporting unmarked helicopters at night landing and leaving quickly from known Taliban hideouts, or at least areas outside of government control.
Others spoke of smugglers bringing in shipments of small boats across the quiet river, called Panj on the Tajikistan side and Amu on the Afghanistan, between the two countries.
It didn't take long before suspicions arose of an international outfit at play. The locals feared going close to the tightly controlled Taliban enclaves to investigate. Around the same time, reports from the U.S. started growing that Russia was once again meddling in Afghanistan -- this time by arming the Taliban.
"I believe what Russia is attempting to do is they are attempting to be an influential party in this part of the world," Gen. Joseph Votel, chief of U.S. Central Command, told American lawmakers in March. "I think it is fair to assume they may be providing some sort of support to [the Taliban] in terms of weapons or other things that may be there."
The recent onslaught of the Taliban into the north of Afghanistan -- once a relatively stable place compared to the insurgency-saturated southern and eastern areas -- can be partly attributed, say many experts and officials, to Russian involvement.
"The success of the Taliban in the north is due to Russian support. In Kunduz province, 30 miles from the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, Taliban has control," Kabul-based analyst Silab Mangal told Fox News. "That's where they get Russian finance and logistics and their wounded fighters can get treatment."
According to Mangal, who cites personal engagement with Taliban in those areas, the Russians have given them weapons over time, including theDragnov sniper rifleand thePTRS-41anti-tank rifle.
Getting in such weapons or advisers smoothly, by air or land, is a hypothetically straight-forward task. Tajikistan shares a zig-zag 750-mile border with northern Afghanistan, and Russia’s largest foreign military installation, Russia’s 201st Rifle Division, is located just across the border.
"Russia has a lot of influences with all the tribes here on the border. They know all the local commanders," one Afghan official, who previously operated in the Panj region and had direct ties to Moscow, said. "In just a few minutes, helicopters can go and come back without too much notice. And boats attract little attention."
Another well-placed intelligence source, who also requested anonymity due to safety concerns in the Taliban-infested region, told Fox News that the mysterious weapons transfers -- coming from abroad -- are in due course empowering the Taliban to maintain a strong foothold in the north of Afghanistan.
According to the source, Russia tightened engagement with the Taliban during the second term of former President Hamid Karzai, around 2009, as his ties with the U.S. deteriorated. But mysterious deliveries allegedly started just prior to the first fall of Kunduz city in 2015. Although seemingly random, they have become more frequent in the past eight months.
Moscow has openly stated that it has an intelligence-sharing relationship with the Taliban regarding the ISIS threat. But they have staunchly denied that the Russian military is aiding or arming the Taliban. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid also denied any Russian monetary or material assistance.
The success of the Taliban in the north [of Afghanistan] is due to Russian support.
Sanjar Sohail, a prominent investigative journalist and publisher of a Farsi-language newspaper, has confirmed that Taliban insurgents in that area have new Russian Kalashnikovs, while previously they only had old Soviet-style guns from the invasion time.
"We know the weapons market in Afghanistan," Sohail said. "This is a new supply."
On Wednesday, the police chief of the northern province of Baghlan, Brig. Gen. Ikramuddin Sarai, told Pajhwok Afghan News that Russian and other foreign military advisers had arrived to support the Taliban amid heavy clashes. Similar reports surfaced last month in the southern province of Uruzgan, in which police chief Ghulam Farooq Sangari told Voice of America's Afghan service that advisers -- including two women dressed in doctor's uniforms and guarded by four armed Taliban along with an Afghan translator -- were in various locations. The accusation was denied by Russian officials.
However, another senior Afghan government security official told Fox News that they have solid, although classified, documents indicating Russia is supporting the Taliban through its ally Iran, under the rationale that they are trying to bring the terrorist group to the negotiating tableto form a peace treatysimilar to the one recently signed by militant group Hezb-e-Islami.
"Iran -- a Shia country -- has its advisers in the north," an intelligence source told Fox News. "The small pockets of Shia in Afghanistan used to get attacked by the Taliban; now they are not harming them or forcing them to pay taxes."
Furthermore, U.S. intelligence also has determined that Russian weapons were used by the Taliban to attack U.S.-supported Afghan soldiers in southern Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan provinces. In a briefing to Congress in December, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, also accused Iran of backing the Taliban.

Title: Russian Support for the Taliban: A New “Great Game” - Fair Observer

By supporting the Taliban, Russia risks pushing Central Asia further into greater cooperation with the United States and China.
The geopolitical implications ofRussia’s growing support for the Talibanin Afghanistan are enormous. While the Russian Federation is likely doing this purely to spite the United States, it is inadvertently undermining its own interests in the region. This represents an ironic and dangerous turn in what has been popularized as a new“Great Game”in Central Asia. Russia’s aid to and support for the Taliban not only threatens US interests, but Chinese ones as well. Thus, Russia has created an opportunity for the United States and China to push back against its controversial actions in Afghanistan through building cooperation on both security and development issues.
Russia’s warming relationship with the Taliban will weaken the foundation of its strategic partnership of mereconveniencewith China for several reasons. Supporting the Taliban directly contradicts one of China’s core diplomatic principles: non-interference in another sovereign nation’s affairs — though China’s hypocrisy with regard to this principle is well known.
China cannot simply look past Russia’s actions in Afghanistan, as both nations are supposed to play leading roles in theShanghai Cooperation Organization(SCO), an organization dedicated to fighting the “three evils” of separatism, extremism and terrorism. The Taliban can easily be linked to the strains of extremism and terrorism that threaten the stability of every Central Asian nation, as well as China’s Muslim Uighur-minority province of Xinjiang. In fact, the Russia-China divide over Afghanistan and Central Asia has already begun with China’s creation of ananti-terror mechanismwith Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan; Russia was notably cut out entirely.
This is unsurprising, as Russian support for a religious fundamentalist organization like the Taliban runs counter to China’s goal of preserving secular stability in Afghanistan, especially at a time when it iscracking downon religiosity in its own Xinjiang Autonomous Province. While China may hedge in itsrelationshipwith the Taliban, it does not actively support the group over the preferable secular government in place. Now, with the chances of aRusso-Sino axison Afghanistan weakening, the United States has an opportunity to expand upon the cooperation it has recently built with China over North Korea by taking advantage of China’s security fears in Central Asia to offset Russia’s actions in Afghanistan.

The United States can also partner with China to provide greater security assistance and capacity training to the Afghan National Army, which has long struggled to establish itself as an effective fighting force against the Taliban. With China’s possiblemilitary presencein eastern Afghanistan, a partnership to legitimize and strengthen their presence will go a long way in helping the US stabilize the country and prevent extremism from spilling into Xinjiang. Considering the United States and China’s mutual interest in Afghanistan’s stability, the destructiveness of a Russian-armed Taliban provides ample incentive for US-Chinese cooperation.
Additionally, by supporting the Taliban in a stronger and more overt manner, Russia risks pushing the nations of Central Asia further toward China for security guarantees and into greater cooperation with the United States. There is strong evidence that otherextremist organizations in the regionhave benefited from the Taliban’s resurgence due to Russia’s support. These benefits have come in the form of military successes, sometimes under Taliban direction, and an overall higher organizational morale. The United States should make every effort to highlight Russia’s duplicitous dealings with the fundamentalist Taliban to nations like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and then offer US support to stabilize their Afghan neighbor.
In a blatant attempt to hurt US interests, Russia risks damaging its own security, its fragile relations with China and its sphere of influence in Central Asia. The contradictions Russia has created for China and the nations of Central Asia are simply too great to ignore. The United States is well positioned with the advent of a Trump-Xi personal rapprochement and state-level cooperation on North Korea to cooperate in another area of mutual interest: Afghanistan.

Title: Weeks After Massive US Bomb, IS Still on Air in Afghanistan | Small Wars Journal
Weeks After Massive US Bomb, IS Still on Air in Afghanistan
Ayesha Tanzeem
Voice of America
Almost three weeks after the United States dropped its most powerful non-nuclear bomb in Eastern Afghanistan, the Islamic State group continues to show battlefield resilience as well as run its FM radio channel in the area.
Earlier this week the Islamic State Khorasan Province, the IS chapter for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia, through its Middle East based news agency Amaq, claimed it wrested control of a volatile district from the Afghan Taliban in Nangarhar, the same province where the bomb was dropped. Provincial government spokesman Ataullah Khogyani confirmed a clash between ISKP and Taliban fighters.
Last week, two American soldiers were killed in an intense three-hour fight with ISKP in the same area. The Pentagon suspected the group’s leader, Abdul Hasib, along with 35 fighters were also killed.The fighting has not had any impact on Khilafat radio, the ISKP FM channel that can still be widely heard in most of Nangarhar province, including the capital Jalalabad.
IS has used the radio to deny government claims that the GBU-43 Massive Ordinance Air Blast, nicknamed the mother of all bombs, killed more than 90 IS fighters, including 13 commanders.
Effective Propaganda ToolLocals say the radio is an effective propaganda tool.
“I am against this radio. But when I listened to it, even I became emotional and thought of going and joining IS,” said Jalalabad resident Romal. He was worried about the impact the radio was having, particularly on youth and on people living in the rural areas.Another resident, Zerak Zaheen, had a similar reaction.
“If it has this kind of an impact on me, what impact must it be having on the illiterate people?” he asked.
The FM channel has been running for more than a year and a half, and despite Afghan government and coalition forces efforts to knock it off air, it has only endured minor hiccups.
The two-hour daily broadcast in the local Dari and Pashto languages airs religious messages and urges people to join ISKP in the “jihad” against foreign forces.
The Islamic State took hold in the Nangarhar province, particularly in Achin and some surrounding districts, in early 2015. Most of the members of the group are former Pakistani Taliban who crossed into Afghanistan when the Pakistani military started a clearing operation in its northern tribal belt called North Waziristan.
Some disgruntled Afghan Taliban, along with some Central Asian militants, mostly Uzbeks and Chechens, also joined the group.
Lately, ISKP has taken responsibility for some major attacks in Kabul as well.
The Afghan military and NATO forces ratcheted up their operations against the group, promising to defeat it this year.Last month, US forces dropped the almost 30 foot bomb, which weighs approximately 10 tons, on a cave and tunnel network in Achin district, saying it was the right weapon under the circumstances.
MOAB Reaction MixedThe use of such a heavy weapon received criticism from various quarters. Former President Hamid Karzai accused the U.S. of using Afghanistan as a testing ground.

Title: Weeks After Massive US Bomb, IS Still on Air in Afghanistan
By Ayesha Tanzeem  May 03, 2017
Almost three weeks after the United States dropped its most powerful non-nuclear bomb in Eastern Afghanistan, the Islamic State group continues to show battlefield resilience as well as run its FM radio channel in the area.
Earlier this week the Islamic State Khorasan Province, the IS chapter for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia, through its Middle East based news agency Amaq, claimed it wrested control of a volatile district from the Afghan Taliban in Nangarhar, the same province where the bomb was dropped. Provincial government spokesman Ataullah Khogyani confirmed a clash between ISKP and Taliban fighters.
Last week, two American soldiers were killed in an intense three-hour fight with ISKP in the same area. The Pentagon suspected the group's leader, Abdul Hasib, along with 35 fighters were also killed.
The fighting has not had any impact on Khilafat radio, the ISKP FM channel that can still be widely heard in most of Nangarhar province, including the capital Jalalabad.
IS has used the radio to deny government claims that the GBU-43 Massive Ordinance Air Blast, nicknamed the mother of all bombs, killed more than 90 IS fighters, including 13 commanders.
Effective propaganda tool
Locals say the radio is an effective propaganda tool.
"I am against this radio. But when I listened to it, even I became emotional and thought of going and joining IS," said Jalalabad resident Romal. He was worried about the impact the radio was having, particularly on youth and on people living in the rural areas.
Another resident, Zerak Zaheen, had a similar reaction.
"If it has this kind of an impact on me, what impact must it be having on the illiterate people?" he asked.
The FM channel has been running for more than a year and a half, and despite Afghan government and coalition forces efforts to knock it off air, it has only endured minor hiccups.
The two-hour daily broadcast in the local Dari and Pashto languages airs religious messages and urges people to join ISKP in the "jihad" against foreign forces.
The Islamic State took hold in the Nangarhar province, particularly in Achin and some surrounding districts, in early 2015. Most of the members of the group are former Pakistani Taliban who crossed into Afghanistan when the Pakistani military started a clearing operation in its northern tribal belt called North Waziristan.
Some disgruntled Afghan Taliban, along with some Central Asian militants, mostly Uzbeks and Chechens, also joined the group.
Lately, ISKP has taken responsibility for some major attacks in Kabul as well.
The Afghan military and NATO forces ratcheted up their operations against the group, promising to defeat it this year.
Last month, US forces dropped the almost 30 foot bomb, which weighs approximately 10 tons, on a cave and tunnel network in Achin district, saying it was the right weapon under the circumstances.
MOAB reaction mixed
The use of such a heavy weapon received criticism from various quarters. Former President Hamid Karzai accused the U.S. of using Afghanistan as a testing ground. The Afghan Taliban condemned the U.S. for using this weapon on Afghan soil.
However, locals have mostly welcomed the move.
"If this bomb killed Daesh (IS) we support it. We want to be rid of Daesh's brutality," said local resident Ahmed Tahir.
None of the locals VOA talked to on several different occasions mentioned any civilian casualties. Most of the civilians in the area, they said, had fled due to brutal tactics employed by ISKP.

Title: ISIS Afghanistan leader Abdul Hasib killed, US military confirms - IBTimes India
United States and Afghanistan troops killed the Islamic State (ISIS) leader in Afghan in an April raid, US military officials on Sunday confirmed.
US- Forces Afghanistan said they carried out a raid in Nangarhar province to target ISIS leader Abdul Hasib. The militant's group is reportedly affiliated with ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The US military calls the group Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K.
Although the US military confirmed Hasib's death only now, the Afghanistan government had confirmed the militant leader was killed on April 27.
"He had ordered the attack on 400 bed hospital in Kabul that resulted in the death and injuries of a number of our countrymen, women. The Afghan government is committed to continuing its operations against Daesh and other terrorist groups until they are annihilated," the Afghan government in a statement said.
The US military officials had earlier said if Hasib's death was confirmed, it would "significantly degrade ISIS-K operations in Afghanistan and help reach our goal of destroying them in 2017," according to AFP.
The raid was conducted near the site where US military dropped the "Mother Of All Bombs" -- a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast device on April 13. The Pentagon had said the bomb, the biggest non-nuclear weapon the US had ever used in combat, was unleashed to target ISIS hideouts in the region.
According to Pentagon estimates, around 1,000 ISIS militants are operating in Afghanistan. The US military data showed the jihadists have established a strong foothold in Afghanistan in early 2015. However, their current numbers are only half of what they were at their peak.
The Pentagon will ask the White House next week to send thousands of more troops to Afghanistan to support the Afghan forces fighting Taliban.

The head of ISIS in Afghanistan was killed in a raid by U.S. and Afghan forces last month that also resulted in the death of two American soliders, the military said Sunday.
A statement by U.S. Forces, Afghanistan confirmed that Sheikh Abdul Hasib, described as the Emir of ISIS in the Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), was killed in the April 27 raid in southern Nangarhar province, eastern Afghanistan.
The raid that killed Hasib was carried out in the same area where the U.S. dropped the so-called "Mother of all Bombs" last month.
TWO US ARMY SOLDIERS KILLED FIGHTING ISIS IN AFGHANISTAN
The Pentagon said that more than 50 U.S. Army Rangers and dozens of other partnered Afghan forces battled ISIS for over three hours in the mountain terrain. Two of the Rangers were killed and a third was wounded. Defense officials told Fox News that friendly fire was the suspected cause of the Rangers' deaths.
Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said Hasib's death marked "another important step in our relentless campaign to defeat ISIS-K in 2017."
"This is the second ISIS-K emir we have killed in nine months, along with dozens of their leaders and hundreds of their fighters," Nicholson added. "For more than two years, ISIS-K has waged a barbaric campaign of death, torture and violence against the Afghan people, especially those in southern Nangarhar."
Hasib is suspected of directing the March 8 attack on a military hospital in the Afghan capital, Kabul, that killed 50 people.
The U.S. currently estimates that around 800 ISIS fighters are based in Afghanistan.

Title: Situation in Afghanistan may Deteriorate in 2018: Coats - The Daily Outlook Afghanistan
WASHINGTON - A top American spymaster, Dan  Coats, warned on Tuesday that Security situation in Afghanistan country was  likely to deteriorate in the year 2018.“The Intelligence Community assesses that the  political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly  deteriorate through 2018 even with a modest increase in military assistance by  the United States and its partners,” Dan Coats, Director of National  Intelligence told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a  Congressional hearing on Worldwide Threats.“This deterioration is underpinned by  Afghanistan's dire economic situation. Afghanistan will struggle to curb its  dependence on external support until it contains the insurgency or reaches a  peace agreement with the Taliban,” Coats said painting a grim picture of this  war torn country.According to Coast, Pakistani-based terrorist  groups would present a sustained threat to US interests in the region and  continue to plan and conduct attacks in India and Afghanistan.“The threat to the United States and the West  from Pakistani-based terrorist groups will be persistent but diffuse.  Plotting against the US homeland will be  conducted on a more opportunistic basis or driven by individual members within  these groups,” he said.“Meanwhile, we assess that the Taliban is  likely to continue to make gains, especially in rural areas. Afghan security  forces performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban  operations, combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support, and weak  leadership,” Coats said.Coats said the overall situation in Afghanistan  would very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is  sustained.Endemic state weaknesses, the government’s  political fragility, deficiencies of the Afghan National Security Forces  (ANSF), Taliban persistence, and regional interference would remain key  impediments to improvement, he said.Kabul’s political dysfunction and  ineffectiveness would almost certainly be the greatest vulnerability to  stability in 2017, he added.ANSF performance would probably worsen due to a  combination of Taliban operations, ANSF combat casualties, desertions, poor  logistics support, and weak leadership, he said. The ANSF would almost  certainly remain heavily dependent on foreign military and financial support to  sustain themselves and preclude their collapse.“Although the Taliban was unsuccessful in  seizing a provincial capital in 2016, it effectively navigated its second  leadership transition in two years following the death of its former chief,  Mansur, and is likely to make gains in 2017,” Coats said.“The fighting will also continue to threaten US  personnel, allies, and partners, particularly in Kabul and urban population  centers,” he said.  “ISIS’s Khorasan  branch (ISIS-K)—which constitutes ISIS’s most significant presence in South  Asia—will probably remain a low-level developing threat to Afghan stability as  well as to US and Western interests in the region in 2017,” Coats  said.(Pajhwok)

Afghan security forces performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban operations, combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support and weak leadership," Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told a Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats.

Afghanistan's internal situation is likely to deteriorate next year due to a number of reasons including the endemic state weakness and Taliban persistence, a top American spymaster said today.
"We assess that the Taliban is likely to continue to make gains, especially in rural areas. Afghan security forces performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban operations, combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support and weak leadership," Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told a Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats.
"The intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018 even with a modest increase in military assistance by the US and its partners.
"This deterioration is underpinned by Afghanistan's dire economic situation. Afghanistan will struggle to curb its dependence on external support until it contains the insurgency or reaches a peace agreement with the Taliban," Coats said, painting a grim picture of the war-torn country.
In his prepared testimony, Coats said the overall situation in Afghanistan will very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is sustained.
Endemic state weaknesses, the government's political fragility, deficiencies of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), Taliban persistence, and regional interference will remain key impediments to improvement, he said.
Kabul's political dysfunction and ineffectiveness will almost certainly be the greatest vulnerability to stability in 2017, Coats said.
ANSF performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban operations, ANSF combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support and weak leadership, he said, adding that the ANSF will almost certainly remain heavily dependent on foreign military and financial support to sustain themselves and preclude their collapse.
"Although the Taliban was unsuccessful in seizing a provincial capital in 2016, it effectively navigated its second leadership transition in two years following the death of its former chief (Mullah) Mansur and is likely to make gains in 2017," Coats said.
"The fighting will also continue to threaten US personnel, allies and partners, particularly in Kabul and urban population centers.
"ISIS' Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), which constitutes ISIS' most significant presence in South Asia, will probably remain a low-level developing threat to Afghan stability as well as to the US and western interests in the region in 2017," Coats added.(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Title: In Afghanistan, a Conflict With No Time Limit

(WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP/Getty Images)
The invasion routes into Afghanistan are well worn at this point in history. The pathways leading out of the country, on the other hand, are far less clear. This is the predicament U.S. President Donald Trump faces as he weighs the Pentagon's proposal to send up to 5,000 troops to Afghanistan to support the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in their 15-year war against the Taliban. If Trump approves the measure, Washington will escalate its involvement in a conflict that has so far lasted through two presidencies. The move would entail granting U.S. troops greater authority on the battlefield, and may well invite a commensurate personnel contribution from the United States' allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

But as much as the Afghan military could use reinforcement -- the Taliban are intensifying their attacks as part of the spring offensive -- Washington understands that more troops will only accomplish...

Title: No Optimism on Afghanistan from DNI: 'Very Likely Continue to Deteriorate'
WASHINGTON, DC —Afghanistan will “continue to deteriorate” this year despite U.S-led international support, primarily because of capability lapses among the American-trained Afghan forces and the expected “gains” by a resurgent Taliban that grew stronger under former President Barack Obama, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Daniel Coatswarnslawmakers in the most recent Worldwide Threat Assessment.
The assessment, prepared by the U.S. intelligence community and presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, notes:
The overall situation in Afghanistan will very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is sustained. Endemic state weaknesses, the government’s political fragility, deficiencies of the Afghan National and Security Forces (ANSF), Taliban persistence, and regional interference will remain key impediments of improvement.
Kabul’s political dysfunction and ineffectiveness will almost certainly be the greatest vulnerability to stability in 2017. ANSF performance will probably worsen due to a combination of Taliban operations, ANSF combat casualties, desertions, poor logistics support, and weak leadership.
The ANSF (or ANDSF) includes both police and army units. Under former President Obama, the U.S. military wasprohibitedfrom offensively attacking the Taliban. They had to wait for the terrorists to shoot first.
“Although the Taliban was unsuccessful in seizing a provincial capital in 2016, it effectively navigated its second leadership transition in two years following the death of its former chief, [Mullah Akhtar] Mansur, and is likely to make gains in 2017,” notes the threat assessment. “The fighting will also continue to threaten US personnel, allies, and partners, particularly in Kabul and urban population centers.”
Terrorists, primarily the Taliban, already control or contest about40 percentof Afghanistan, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) learned from the U.S. military.
Despite receiving more than $71 billion from the United States alone to develop its fighting abilities, the Afghan forces continue to suffer from capability lapses.
Since the war started in October 2001, the United States has devoted $117 billion in American taxpayer funds on reconstruction efforts, including more than 61 percent on the ANDSF alone.
SIGAR reports:
Yet serious problems persist. A dangerous and stubborn insurgency controls or exerts influence over areas holding about a third of the Afghan population. Heavy casualties and capability gaps limit the effectiveness of Afghan soldiers and police. Opium production stands near record levels. Illiteracy and poverty remain widespread. Corruption reaches into every aspect of national life. The rule of law has limited reach. Multiple obstacles deter investors and complicate business operations. The ranks of the job-less grow as the economy stagnates…
The ANDSF faces many problems: unsustainable casualties, temporary losses of provincial and district centers, weakness in logistics and other functions, illiteracy in the ranks, often corrupt or ineffective leadership, and over-reliance on highly trained special forces for routine missions.
The Afghan forces are expected to remain heavily reliant on assistance from the U.S. military and their allies, even though they are in the lead of security responsibilities.
The Worldwide Threat Assessment points out, “The ANSF will almost certainly remain heavily dependent on foreign military and financial support to sustain themselves and preclude their collapse.”
Although the Taliban is the strongest and most prominent terrorist group in Afghanistan, the Islamic State’s Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) will not only remain a “developing threat” to Afghanistan’s security, they will also threaten American and Western interests in the region in 2017, notes the Worldwide Threat Assessment.
The U.S. military did recentlykillthe ISIS-K leader, but hundreds of members of the group remain in Afghanistan.
Moreover, 15 years-plus since U.S.-led coalition forces began fighting the Taliban and theiral-Qaedaallies in Afghanistan, “remaining members of al-Qa’ida and its regional affiliate, al-Qa’Ida In the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS)… maintain the intent to conduct attacks against the United States and the West,” reports the intelligence community.
President Donald Trumpinheritedchaos and overall deteriorating security conditions in the war-devastated country that are no showing any sign of improving.
Assessments by the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community show that Obama left Afghanistan in worse shape than when he took office in January 2009.
Pakistan continues to serve as a sanctuary for he Taliban, ISIS-K, al-Qaeda, and other jihadist groups.
Throughout the Afghanistan war — raging since October 2001— most battles between the United States forces and jihadists have taken place at or around Afghan provinces that border Pakistan —nearly 80percent in 2010, the deadliest year of the ongoing conflict.

Vodafone Idea (Vi) has said it’s now up to the government to come up with a mechanism to offer financial relief to the company, after the Supreme Court’s recent rejection of the telco’s curative petition seeking a re-computation of its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.
India’s aspiration to be a $7-trillion economy by the end of the decade can be achieved as a “strong” Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolls out the digital and physical infrastructure that’s drawing multinationals involved in manufacturing advanced products and services, said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan.
This is India’s moment and the country should seize it, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said after a roundtable in New York between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leading technology industry CEOs. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent Alphabet, said the Prime Minister has a clear vision of the opportunity that artificial intelligence will create, and is challenging top companies to do more in India.
Securing a US student visa is just the beginning for international students. Maintaining it is crucial, as violations like prolonged absence, unauthorized transfer, or fraudulent activities can lead to revocation. Immediate steps include understanding the reason, contacting university services, reapplying or appealing, and seeking legal assistance if necessary.
High net worth Indians are using corporate credit cards for personal expenses during overseas travels to avoid breaching the $250,000 annual limit on foreign remittance. The government may soon implement rules to include international credit card spends under this limit, but distinguishing personal from business expenses remains challenging.
Prodigy Finance has announced a $5,000 scholarship for students pursuing higher education abroad for the Spring 2025 intake. Applications open in September 2024 and close on September 30, 2024. Eligible candidates must be accepted into a Prodigy Finance-supported program and demonstrate academic excellence and community commitment.

Title: Pakistan views all challenges through the lens of ‘Indian threat’: US official – India TV
A top American intelligence official on Tuesday told US lawmakers that Pakistan is “harbouring terrorists” and using them as "reserve" in Afghanistan because it views all of the challenges through the lens of an “Indian threat”.
Lt Gen Vincent Stewart, director, Defense Intelligence Agency told members of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee that Pakistan does not want heavy Indian influence in Afghanistan and added that Islamabad sees role for these terrorists if Afghanistan leans towards India.
"Pakistan views Afghanistan or desires for Afghanistan some of the same things we want: a safe, secure, stable Afghanistan. One addition — one that does not have heavy Indian influence in Afghanistan," Lt Gen Vincent Stewart said during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats.
"They view all of the challenges through the lens of an Indian threat to the state of Pakistan," Stewart said.
"So they (Pakistan) hold in reserve terrorist organisation — we define them as terrorist organisations, they hold them in reserve so that — if Afghanistan leans towards India, they will no longer be supportive of an idea of a stable and secure Afghanistan that could undermine Pakistan interest," Stewart said.
He said Pakistan needs to be told very clearly that Afghanistan's security and stability is in the interest of all of the parties in the region and does not pose a risk to Pakistan.
"We've got to convince Pakistan that if they're harbouring any of the Haqqani network members that it is not in their interest to continue to host of Haqqani network, that we ought to be working together to go after those 20 terrorist organisations that undermine not just Afghanistan, not just Pakistan, but all of the region," he said.
"And so, we've to make sure we're pushing them to do more against the Haqqani network. Then (they should) separate the Taliban from the Pashtun, which want a Pashtun dominated Afghanistan," he said.
"So, we've got to get the conversation going again with Pakistan about their role in not harboring any of these terrorists, helping to stabilise Afghanistan," he added.
Hoping that US may have some progress in this, Stewart said Pakistan also have some influence in bringing the Taliban to the peace table.
