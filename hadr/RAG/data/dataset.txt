Top ISIS leader in Somalia was target of US airstrike - ABC News
U.S. officials said it's unclear if the ISIS leader was killed in the strike.
A United States military airstrike in Somalia targeted the top Islamic State leader in late May, but it remains unclear if the leader was killed in the airstrike, according to U.S. officials.
Abdulqadir Mumin has beenidentifiedby the U.S. as the head of the Islamic State in Somalia, an African affiliate of the terror group once known as ISIS.
Astatementfrom U.S. Africa Command disclosed that on May 31 it had conducted an airstrike in a remote area of northeastern Somalia, south of the Gulf of Aden, that killed three militants affiliated with the Islamic State. The statement did not provide more accurate information about who was specifically being targeted in the airstrike.
Three U.S. officials confirmed to ABC News that the target of the strike was the top leader of the Islamic State in Somalia whom the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) identified as Mumin. However, the U.S. officials said it remained unclear if Mumin had been killed in the airstrike.

A fourth U.S. official would only confirm that a senior Islamic State leader was the target of the strike but would not comment on the individual's name.
NBC News was first to report that Mumin was the target of the May 31 airstrike and that he had become the global leader of Islamic State.
The NCTC describes Mumin as the founder and leader of the Islamic State in Somalia that operates primarily in the semi-autonomous area of northeastern Somalia known as Puntland.

Founded in 2015, the terror group became an official affiliate of ISIS in 2018 and is believed to have between 100 and 400 members that mainly carry out what are described as "small-scale, sporadic attacks and assassination operations against Somali Government officials and security forces, government-affiliated civilians, Puntland security forces, Africa Union Mission in Somalia peacekeepers, business owners refusing to pay extortion demands, and al-Shabaab."
Al-Shabaabis the main Islamic militant group in Somalia where its nearly 10,000 members operate in the southern part of the country and is the usual target of U.S. airstrikes in support of Somalia's government.

US targeted Islamic State group leader in airstrike last month: Report - Washington Examiner
U.S. forces launched anairstrikelast month inSomaliatargeting the leader of theIslamic State group, Abdulqadir Mumin. However, according to U.S. officials, it is unknown whether Mumin was one of the three militants belonging to the group who were killed in the strike.
U.S. Africa Command released astatementMay 31 about the strike, which did not result in any civilian deaths. AFRICOM did not include any information about the target, however, according to areportfrom NBC News, three unnamed U.S. officials have since said it was Mumin.
The Office of the Director of National IntelligencelistsMumin as the leader and founder of the Islamic State group’s Somalia affiliate, which has between 100 and 400 members. He has been a “specially designated global terrorist” since August 2016. The unnamed U.S. officials said he became the global leader of the terrorist group after his predecessor, Abu al-Hassan al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi,diedin combat in October 2022 in Syria.
Iraq and Syria are home to the largest concentrations of Islamic State group members, but U.S. forces have been effective against leadership there. One senior defense official told NBC News that leaders of the terrorist group view Africa as “a place where they should invest, where they are more permissive and able to operate better and more freely, and they want to expand the ISIS cell there. So they did bring the caliph to that region.”

The group in Somalia “uses small arms and IEDs to conduct small-scale, sporadic attacks and assassination operations against Somali Government officials and security forces, government-affiliated civilians, Puntland security forces, Africa Union Mission in Somalia peacekeepers, business owners refusing to pay extortion demands, and al-Shabaab,” according to the ODNI.
“Somalia remains central to the security environment in East Africa,” according to AFRICOM. “U.S. Africa Command’s forces will continue training, advising, and equipping partner forces to degrade ISIS.”

Three U.S. officials confirmed to ABC News that the target of the strike was the top leader of the Islamic State in Somalia whom the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) identified as Mumin. However, the U.S. officials said it remained unclear if Mumin had been killed in the airstrike.
A fourth U.S. official would only confirm that a senior Islamic State leader was the target of the strike but would not comment on the individual's name.
NBC News was first to report that Mumin was the target of the May 31 airstrike and that he had become the global leader of Islamic State.
The NCTC describes Mumin as the founder and leader of the Islamic State in Somalia that operates primarily in the semi-autonomous area of northeastern Somalia known as Puntland.
Founded in 2015, the terror group became an official affiliate of ISIS in 2018 and is believed to have between 100 and 400 members that mainly carry out what are described as "small-scale, sporadic attacks and assassination operations against Somali Government officials and security forces, government-affiliated civilians, Puntland security forces, Africa Union Mission in Somalia peacekeepers, business owners refusing to pay extortion demands, and al-Shabaab."
Al-Shabaabis the main Islamic militant group in Somalia where its nearly10,000 membersoperate in the southern part of the country and is the usual target of U.S. airstrikes in support of Somalia's government.

	US Targeted ISIS Leader Abdul Qadir Mumin in Somalia in Late May | Newsmax.com

Saturday, 15 June 2024 10:38 AM EDT
The U.S. military reportedly conducted a late-May airstrike targetingglobal ISIS leader Abdul Qadir Muminhiding out in Somalia but has yet to confirm if he was killed.
Mumin is the Director of National Intelligence targeted leader of the ISIS-Somalia call of the U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and was believed to be hiding in Somalia for the May 31 airstrikeannounced by U.S. Africa Command.
NBC News sourcesconfirmed he was the target of those strikes but officials have been unable to confirm if the ISIS leader was killed. Three unidentified terrorists were killed in the strike with no civilian casualties.
"U.S. Africa Command takes great measures to prevent civilian casualties," the May 31 statement read. "Protecting innocent civilians remains a vital part of the command’s operations to promote a more secure and stable Africa.
"ISIS has conducted numerous attacks globally, including terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, all while continuing to plot against U.S. homeland and personnel and interests around the world, as well as regional partners, and others globally. U.S. Africa Command, alongside its partners, continues to take action to prevent this terrorist group from planning and conducting attacks, which disproportionately harms civilians.
"Somalia remains central to the security environment in East Africa. U.S. Africa Command"s forces will continue training, advising, and equipping partner forces to degrade ISIS."
The Biden administration has targeted global terrorist networks with its "over-the-horizon" capabilities worldwide after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which left 13 U.S. servicemembers dead in a terrorist bombing at a refugee escape route.
U.S. Africa Command is headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany.
The U.S. Treasury Department said Friday the United States and Turkey are working together to crack down on a human smuggling network linked to ISIS.
After a probe closely coordinated with Ankara, Washington imposed sanctions on four individuals, three of whom were involved in the network, it said in a statement.
"As a result of this close cooperation, [Turkey] is concurrently taking its own domestic action against this network," it said.
The statement did not say how long the group had been operating or how many people it had smuggled.
In May, Turkish authorities said they had detained 41 people suspected of having ties to ISIS in operations across 12 provinces. Islamic State controlled one third of Iraq and Syria at its 2014 peak and though beaten back, it continues to wage insurgent attacks.
